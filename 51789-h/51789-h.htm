<p class="pc1 mid">THE REVOLUTION IMPENDING.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY MELLEN CHAMBERLAIN,</p>

<p class="pc reduct"><i>Librarian Boston Public Library.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE American Revolution was no unrelated event, but formed a part
of the history of the British race on both continents, and was not without
influence on the history of mankind. As an event in British history, it
wrought with other forces in effecting that change in the Constitution of
the mother country which transferred the prerogatives of the crown to the
Parliament, and led to the more beneficent interpretation of its provisions
in the light of natural rights. As an event in American history, it marks
the period, recognized by the great powers of Europe, when a people, essentially
free by birth and by the circumstances of their situation, became entitled,
because justified by valor and endurance, to take their place among
independent nations. Finally, as an event common to the history of both
nations, it stands midway between the Great Rebellion and the Revolution
of 1688, on the one hand, and the Reform Bill of 1832 and the extension
of suffrage in 1884, on the other, and belongs to a race which had adopted
the principles of the Reformation and of the Petition of Right.</p>

<p>The American Revolution was not a quarrel between two peoples,&mdash;the
British people and the American people,&mdash;but, like all those events which
mark the progress of the British race, it was a strife between two parties,
the conservatives in both countries as one party, and the liberals in
both countries as the other party; and some of its fiercest battles were
fought in the British Parliament. Nor did it proceed in one country alone,
but in both countries at the same time, with nearly equal step, and was
essentially the same in each, so that at the close of the French War, if
all the people of Great Britain had been transported to America and put
in control of American affairs, and all the people of America had been
transported to Great Britain and put in control of British affairs, the American
Revolution and the contemporaneous British Revolution&mdash;for there
was a contemporaneous British Revolution&mdash;might have gone on just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
same, and with the same final results. But the British Revolution was to
regain liberty; the American Revolution was to preserve liberty. Both
peoples had a common history in the events which led to the Great Rebellion;
but in the reaction which followed the Restoration, that part of the
British race which awaited the conflict in the old home passed again under
the power of the prerogative, and, after the accession of William III., came
under the domination of the great Whig families. The British Revolution,
therefore, was to recover what had been lost. But those who emigrated to
the colonies left behind them institutions which were monarchical, in church
and state, and set up institutions which were democratic. And it was to
preserve, not to acquire, these democratic institutions that the liberal party
carried the country through a long and costly war.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The American Revolution, in its earlier stages at least, was not a contest
between opposing governments or nationalities, but between two different
political and economic systems, to each of which able and honest
men then adhered, and now adhere. The motives and conduct of each
party, therefore, ought to be stated with exact impartiality. It was not only
inevitable, but wise, and on the whole wisely conducted in accordance with
the traditions and methods of political action to which our British race had
been accustomed. It was also honestly and fairly opposed by those who
neither accepted revolutionary principles, nor recognized the validity of the
reasons assigned for their application to the existing state of affairs.</p>

<p>Readers of American history from the Restoration of Charles II., in
1660, to the Revolution find frequent reference to the King's Prerogatives,
Navigation Laws, Acts of Trade, and in later years to Writs of Assistance,
as subjects of complaint between Great Britain and her colonies; and as
these were among the immediate causes of the war, they require explanation.
When the Earl of Hillsborough (April 22, 1768) required the House
of Representatives of Massachusetts, through Governor Bernard (June
21st), in his majesty's name, to rescind the resolution which had given birth
to their Circular Letter of February 11, 1768, the order was a claim of
right by the king to control the legislative action of that province; and the
refusal of the House was regarded by the prerogative party both in Great
Britain and in the colonies as in derogation of the king's constitutional
power.</p>

<p>What was the foundation of this alleged authority of the king over the
colonies? By the public law of all civilized nations in the fifteenth century,
the property in unoccupied lands belonged to the crown of the country
by which they were discovered;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and if, as was generally the case,
these lands were inhabited by savages, still the fee was in the crown,
subject only to such use as might be made of them by wandering tribes.
Such is the law to-day. This title to the English colonies was not in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
people of England nor in the state, but in the crown, and descended with
it. The crown alone could sell or give away these lands. The crown could
make laws for the inhabitants, and repeal them; could appoint their rulers,
and remove them. Parliament could do neither. The political relations
of the colonists were to the crown, not to the government of England; nor
were they in any respect subject to parliamentary legislation.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> They were
not citizens within the realm, nor, except in a qualified sense, of the empire,
but subjects of the crown, having only such rights as it granted to
them in their charters; and even these charters the crown claimed, and
exercised the right to amend or revoke. James I. amended that of Virginia
in 1624, and Charles II. revoked that of Massachusetts in 1684. They
were regarded merely as charters of incorporated land companies, and, as
such, subject to revocation by the king who granted them; and when these
companies had developed into municipal governments, they were considered
as still subject to alteration or repeal by the sovereign power,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> although
in both cases rights of property were saved to the owners. Strange as this
doctrine may seem, it is now substantial law in England and in America.</p>

<p>To all these rights, privileges, and disabilities the emigrants agreed when
they purchased lands from the crown; and the rights and duties, whether
of the crown or of its subjects, descended to their respective successors.
With such rights, though not in all cases with such views in respect to
them, the colonists came to America; and such rights, and no more, their
children possessed, under the British Constitution, at the time of the American
Revolution, in the days of George III.</p>

<p>These claims of the crown every colony resisted as incompatible with its
essential rights, and yet they were legal and constitutional prerogatives,
admitted by the greatest judges of England, and most necessarily have
been admitted in the colonies not only by Hutchinson and Oliver, but by
James Otis and John Adams, had they sat as judges. It was on this legal
and constitutional ground that the prerogative party stood both in England
and in America.</p>

<p>But in England from the time of James I., and in America from the coming
of Winthrop, there had been an anti-prerogative party; and as the
prerogative party in England and the prerogative party in America were
one and the same, so the anti-prerogative party in England and the anti-prerogative
party in the colonies were one and the same, having similar
views, and, though separated by a thousand leagues, working to the same
end. On this question came the first political contest of the Revolution;
that of parliamentary supremacy came later. The strength of one side
was in legal and constitutional principles, as they were then interpreted
by judicial tribunals; that of the other lay in the changes which were taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
place in the British Constitution,&mdash;in short, in revolution. The revolutionary
party succeeded in both countries: in America, by war; in
England, by more silent influences which have greatly modified, if not destroyed,
the prerogative.</p>

<p>Although the prerogative was a cardinal right in the British Constitution,
and freely exercised by popular sovereigns like Elizabeth, it began to
be questioned under James I., and resisted under Charles I., who lost his
life in its defence, as James II. lost his crown.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But the progress of this
revolution was not steady, nor did it always hold what it had gained. There
came periods of reaction, one of which was in the early days of George III.
He was strenuous in maintaining his prerogative, and, by the support
of the "King's Friends", probably held it with a firmer hand than any of
his predecessors since Elizabeth. The contest about the prerogatives encountered
this difficulty: that successful resistance in a particular instance
settled no principle, but left all other cases untouched.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The extension of
the navigation acts to the colonies by Parliament, though assented to by
King Charles II., was in derogation of his prerogatives; and so in the time
of William III. (1696) was the attempt to transfer certain colonial affairs
from the Privy Council, which represented the king, to a proposed Council
of Commerce, which would have been the creature of Parliament. In consistency
with these proceedings, the king's power over the colonies ought
to have been transferred to Parliament; and instead of remaining the king's
colonies, they ought to have become a part of the empire, and his authority
over them no greater than that over the territory within the four seas.
But it was otherwise. The colonists remained the king's subjects. He
appointed their governors; he frequently set aside their laws, and over them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
he exercised his royal prerogatives. One capital point, however, had been
gained by the revolutionary party on both sides of the water. Successful
invasions of the prerogative had at length created what was called the
"spirit of the constitution."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The loyalists, however, seemed to be firmly
entrenched in their constitutional position, nor did the anti-prerogative
party avoid a dilemma: how to escape out of the hands of the king without
falling into the hands of Parliament. If, as some claimed when they
resisted the royal prerogative, they were British subjects, entitled to the
same rights and privileges as native-born subjects within the realm, why
then should they, more than other subjects, be free from the burdens imposed
by the imperial policy? But when, in pursuance of that policy, Parliament
undertook to tax the colonies, then they were forced by the logic
of the situation to claim that, though subjects of "the best of kings", they
owed no more allegiance to Parliament than the Scotch did before the
union.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Probably no one more heartily detested the claims of the prerogative
than Franklin; and yet the phase which the controversy had assumed
compelled him to take high prerogative ground. Such was his position
with regard to the Stamp Act, as is seen in the note below.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Andros himself
could have asked for nothing better, in 1686; and when Franklin was
asked what the king could do, should the colonies refuse just requisitions,
he had no other answer than this,&mdash;that they would not refuse!</p>

<p>Such is the doctrine of the prerogative which gave rise to constant conflicts
between the king and the colonists, from 1660 to 1774, and in every
colony was among the political causes which led to the Revolution. But
it was an English question as well as an American question,&mdash;a party
question in both countries, and it was finally settled with the same result
in each, though by different means. We must look further for the real controversy
between the English people and the American people.</p>

<p>Another cause of the Revolution, but one which, in no strict sense, concerned
the political relations between the people of Great Britain and the
American colonists, was the attempt of the British merchants to monopolize
the trade of the colonies, not for the benefit of the British people, but
for their own. This also was a party question, on one side of which were
arrayed the adherents of the Mercantile or Protective System, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
other those of the Economic or Free Trade System. The mercantile class
endeavored to subordinate colonial interests to the protective system by
navigation laws and acts of trade; and the resistance of the colonists to
these acts was a claim for free trade which finally involved them in a war
with the mother country.</p>

<p>What were those navigation laws and acts of trade which called forth
the invective of James Otis when he argued the Writs of Assistance, and
revived in the bosom of the octogenarian John Adams the hearty curse he
bestowed upon them in his youth; and on what foundation did they rest?<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Nations acquire new territories, and maintain and defend them, to promote
their own interests, and not the interests of those who inhabit them;
still less the interests of other nationalities. This has been the case in
all ages and under all forms of government, to which our own age and
nation form no exception. By the right of discovery the British crown
became possessed of the territory included in the thirteen American colonies,
settled mainly by British subjects. Lands were granted to individuals,
or companies, with the expectation that they would build up prosperous
communities, to contribute by their products and trade to the wealth
of the mother country. On these purely selfish considerations she protected
them; and when their trade was grown to be considerable and their markets
valuable, the British merchants took measures to secure both, instead
of sharing them with other nations, or allowing them to follow the interests
of the colonists. Such was the policy of Great Britain at the dictation of
the mercantile class; and in the maintenance of that policy, in sixty years
between 1714 and 1774, she paid out of her Exchequer the enormous sum of
£34,697,142 sterling, a sum greater than the estimated value of the whole
real and personal property in the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Between 1660 and 1770 Parliament enacted various laws whose enforcement
produced irritation from the beginning, and had no inconsiderable
influence in promoting the final rupture. These acts may be classed as,&mdash;First,
navigation laws, designed to secure the naval and maritime
supremacy of Great Britain throughout the world; these were aimed at
the Dutch. Second, acts of trade, procured by the mercantile class, to
monopolize the trade of the British colonies. Like the corn-laws of a later
generation, these formed part of the protective system, and were dictated
by class interest. Third, acts for the protection of British manufactures by
preventing their growth in the colonies, where their best market was found.
Fourth, acts designed to secure the strict execution of the preceding acts
by establishing colonial admiralty courts, custom-houses, and boards of customs.
Fifth, acts which imposed and regulated duties and port charges
in commercial towns. In no sense were these acts for revenue, British or
colonial. They brought nothing into the British Exchequer, but drew large
sums from it.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> They were passed solely in the interest of the mercantile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and manufacturing classes, whose protection had much to do with bringing
on the Revolution, but whose clamors happily prevented efficient measures
for its suppression. These demonstrations, which gained them great
credit in the colonies, grew out of their fear of losing not only the
£4,000,000 due by their colonial debtors, but also their future trade.</p>

<p>Before the Grenville Act of 1764 no measures had been taken to relieve
the Exchequer from demands on account of the colonies. The people and
the government had suffered the mercantile and manufacturing classes to
dictate their colonial policy. Not that the prosperity of these classes did
not contribute to the general prosperity of the realm; for, on the contrary,
it had made Great Britain the most affluent and powerful country on the
globe. But this system did not promote the welfare of all classes alike;
and when the time came, as it did after the frightful expenditure in the
French War, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was compelled to ask for
ready money to pay the interest on the debt and to meet current expenses,
neither the merchants nor the manufacturers, who had grown rich by the
war, offered on that account to pay larger taxes, but they were quite willing
that the British farmer should do so, or that a revenue should be sought
from the American colonies.</p>

<p>Some account of these famous laws is essential at this point. There
were three statutes embraced under the general term Navigation Laws
and Acts of Trade, in which are to be found the principles of the Mercantile
System. They were passed in 1660, 1663, and 1672, during the reign
of Charles II., and may be found in the <i>Statutes at Large</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> with the following
titles respectively: "An Act for the Encouraging and Increasing
of Shipping and Navigation", "An Act for the Encouragement of Trade",
and "An Act for the Encouragement of the Greenland and Eastland Trades,
and for the Better Securing the Plantation Trade."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The navigation laws will be more readily understood if we attend solely
to their effect on the American colonies, and disregard unimportant exceptions
and limitations. By the act of 1660, none but English or colonial
ships could carry goods to or bring them from the colonies. This excluded
all foreigners, and especially the Dutch, who at that time were the principal
carriers for Europe. The result was that the colonists lost the advantage
of their competition. Far more serious was the provision which restricted
them from carrying sugar, tobacco, cotton, wool, indigo, ginger, fustic and
all other dyeing wood, the product of any English colony, to any part
of the world, except Great Britain, or some other English colony. This
affected the English sugar islands of the West Indies and the Southern
colonies, which were obliged to send their products to the overstocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
English or colonial markets, more than it affected New England, whose
great staples, lumber, fish, oil, ashes, and furs, were free to find their best
market, provided only they were sent in English or colonial vessels.</p>

<p>British merchants not satisfied with this monopoly procured a more stringent
act in 1663, which provided that no commodity, the growth, product,
or manufacture of Europe, should be imported into the colonies, except
in English-built ships, sailing from English ports. By this act England
became the sole market in which the colonists could purchase the products
or manufactures of Europe, nor could they send their own ships for
them, unless English-built or bought before October 1, 1662. They were
obliged to buy in English markets and import in English vessels.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This
discouraged ship-building for the European trade in a country full of timber,
and compelled the payment of charges and profits to English factors
dealing in Continental goods for the American market.</p>

<p>By these two acts British merchants had undertaken to monopolize, with
certain exceptions, the carrying trade of the colonies and their markets for
the sale and the purchase of goods. But avarice was not satisfied. There
had grown up a trade, especially profitable to New England, with the
Southern colonies which were without shipping. By the act of 1660, foreign
and intercolonial trade in certain articles was permitted, with the
expectation that it would be limited to necessary local supply. But Boston
merchants, shipping to that port tobacco and some other colonial products
in excess of the local demand, sent the surplus to Continental Europe, without
payment of British or colonial duties, and thus undersold the British
trader, who had paid heavy import duties. To suppress this profitable
irregularity, it was enacted in 1672 that the enumerated products shipped
to other colonies should be first transported to England, and thence to the
purchasing colony. The colonial merchants had the option, however, of
bringing tobacco, for instance, from Virginia direct to Massachusetts, first
paying an export duty equivalent to the English import duty.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>These enactments subjected colonial interests to those of British ship-owners
and merchants; and as they had been thus duly protected, the manufacturers
in turn claimed similar protection by statutes which should prevent
the colonists from setting up competing manufactories.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> How could
there have been any difference of opinion among the colonists respecting
such statutes? A general answer is, that the colonial system, which regarded
the colonies as feeders for the navigation, trade, and manufactures
of the parent state, was the accepted doctrine of European statesmen. Pitt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was its stanchest advocate, and Burke its rational friend. Adam Smith,
who assaulted it in 1776,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> did not succeed in overthrowing it. Twenty-five
years later, Henry Brougham controverted Smith's views.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It is not strange,
therefore, that it found advocates among the colonists themselves. It was
also far from being a one-sided question.</p>

<p>James Otis's arguments on the Writs of Assistance and John Adams's
letters to William Tudor, by dwelling on the injurious features of these
acts, and passing over all compensating considerations, give an erroneous
notion of them. The idea that they originated in a hostile disposition of
the British people or merchants towards the colonists is not entitled to a
moment's consideration. They formed a commercial policy, not a political
policy. The more numerous, wealthy, and prosperous the colonists became,
the more useful they were to the British merchants, so long as they could
monopolize the trade. That was their object; and where the freedom of
colonial trade would not interfere with British trade, it was left free. For
example, the most profitable trade of New England was with the French
and Spanish West India Islands and the Spanish Main. The short distance
favored small vessels and small capitals. The exchange of lumber,
grain, cattle, and fish for sugar and molasses, with an occasional voyage
to the coast of Africa for slaves, during that traffic,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> yielded rich returns.
This trade was free; and so was that of Asia and Africa, and some ports of
Europe, except for certain enumerated articles. It was not only permitted,
but with respect to some commodities was encouraged by bounties. Between
1714 and 1774, the colonists, chiefly those of New England, received
£1,609,345 sterling on their commodities exported to Great Britain;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and
through a system of drawbacks, by which the duties on goods imported
into England were repaid on their exportation to America, the colonists
often bought Continental goods cheaper than could the subjects within the
realm. These favors no more indicated good will than the restrictions indicated
hostility. Both rested on purely commercial considerations. There
were other compensations. The naval supremacy of Great Britain, due
chiefly to the navigation laws, protected colonial commerce in whatever
seas it was pushed; and the stimulus of monopoly withdrew British capital
from other less lucrative enterprises, and directed it to the colonies,
where it was freely used by planters in developing lands which otherwise
would have been uncultivated for lack of capital.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> And although certain
colonial produce was obliged to find its only European market in England,
it had the monopoly of that market.</p>

<p>If it was a hardship to the tobacco growers of Maryland and Virginia to
be compelled to send that product to England, they had this advantage,
that no Englishman could use any other. He was forbidden by penal statutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to grow his own supply even in his own garden. As to those laws
which restrained manufactures in the colonies, it was the opinion of Henry
Brougham,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> who cites Franklin as an authority, that they merely prohibited
the colonist from making articles which could have been more cheaply purchased.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
He could import a hat from England for less than it cost to make
one, and he did so. But the best ground for nominal submission to the
navigation laws and acts of trade was found in their easy evasion, and
the fact that they never were, and never could have been, rigidly enforced.
From the first, all attempts to enforce them led to dissatisfaction. Randolph's
revenue seizures in the time of Charles II. and James II. had no
small influence in overthrowing Andros's government in the revolution of
1689, and so had Charles Paxton's in bringing on the American Revolution.</p>

<p>Before the new policy of enforcing these laws was entered upon, the colonies
enjoyed British naval protection; they possessed the monopoly of
the British market; they drew bounties from the British Exchequer; they
purchased European goods more cheaply than the British people could do;
and, stating the facts somewhat broadly, they manufactured whatever they
found to be for their advantage, and sent their ships wherever they pleased,
notwithstanding the navigation laws and acts of trade. The result was that
the colonies, especially barren and frozen New England, engrossed most
profitable commerce which England had attempted to monopolize, and
increased in wealth beyond all colonial precedent.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But these halcyon days
were destined to pass under clouds. British merchants had seen from
the beginning the amassing of fortunes in the colonies by illicit trade, and
the falling off of their own. They had striven to enforce the laws, and
Parliament had lent its assistance,&mdash;but in vain. Under the first charter
of Massachusetts, the collector of customs was the governor, whose annual
election depended upon the good will of those who were evading the navigation
laws; under the second charter, the governor was appointed by the
king, and sworn to enforce those laws. But colonial juries generally checkmated
the king's representative. Then followed admiralty courts without
juries, which produced indignant protests. The new system was irritating
rather than efficient on a long line of coast filled with bays, creeks, and
ports not patrolled by revenue cutters. The British merchant was foiled,
and anger was the result. The attempt to monopolize the commerce of
the colonies was a failure; and so long as the navigation laws were a dead
letter the advantages of the situation were with the colonists. They were
content.</p>

<p>But the time came at the close of the French War when the mercantile
system was subordinated to a revenue system, and the enforcement of the
navigation laws and acts of trade, made more stringent by some new ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
became the policy of the government. Its instruments were admiralty
courts with enlarged jurisdiction, commissioners of customs, writs of assistance,
and an adequate naval force. When that time came, the Revolution
was not far off!<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>In 1755, Shirley, then governor of Massachusetts, had persuaded the
General Court to attempt by a stamp act to meet the expenses of the
French War. This produced an irritation like that which followed in 1765
the act of the British ministry;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and to Shirley, as much as to any other
man, perhaps, was due the suggestion of those parliamentary measures
which led to the Revolution. Long residence in Boston and his profession
as a lawyer had made him familiar with the evasions of the navigation
laws; and his larger duties as commander-in-chief, in which he found much
difficulty in bringing the colonial assemblies into concerted and efficient
action, doubtless suggested measures which were adopted by the British
ministry. However this may have been, the enforcement of the navigation
laws was taken in hand for the first time by the government, and no longer
left to depend upon private interests. This unwonted activity was shown
as early as 1754. Its most formidable weapon was the Writ of Assistance.</p>

<p>More than four years before the passage of the Stamp Act, James Otis
had resisted the granting of these writs before the Superior Court of Massachusetts.
John Adams, then a student of law, took notes of Otis's argument,
and fifty-six years later wrote: "Then and there was the first scene
of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then
and there the child Independence was born."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> This was no mere rhetorical
phrase.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The influence of this controversy in producing the Revolution
is not wholly due to the fiery eloquence of Otis, whose words, said John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Adams, "breathed into the nation the breath of life", nor to the range of
his argument, which called in question the mercantile and political systems
of Great Britain, but to their effect upon the commercial interest&mdash;then
the leading one&mdash;of New England; for if the latent powers of these
writs were set free, and used by the revenue officers, the commerce of Boston,
Salem, and Newport would have been effectually crippled. Authorized
in England, they were extended to the colonies by an act of William III.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The officers of customs, however, instead of applying to the courts for them,
relied upon the implied powers of their commissions, and forcibly entered
warehouses for contraband goods. The people grew uneasy, and some stood
upon their rights against the officers, whose activity was stimulated by documents
like that given in the note below.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Governor Shirley issued these writs, though the power to do so was solely
in the court.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But they would have held a less important place in the history
of the Revolution had it not been for the concurrence of several circumstances.
All writs become invalid on the demise of the crown and six
months thereafter. George II. died October 25, 1760, and the news reached
Boston December 27th. The government had already resolved upon a more
vigorous enforcement of the revenue laws. The king had instructed Bernard,
the newly appointed governor of Massachusetts, to "be aiding and
assisting to the collectors and other officers of our admiralty and customs
in putting in execution" the acts of trade. Pitt also directed the colonial
governors to prevent trade with the enemy and a commerce which was
"in open contempt of the authority of the mother country, as well as to
the most manifest prejudice of the manufactures and trade of Great Britain."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Seizures of uncustomed goods were frequent. The third part of
the forfeiture of molasses which belonged to the province amounted before
1761 to nearly five hundred pounds in money. Bernard arrived in August,
1760. Chief Justice Sewall, who had expressed doubts as to the legality
of writs of assistance, died September 11th; and Hutchinson, his successor,
took his seat January 27, 1761. As the outstanding writs had become
invalid, their renewal became necessary. But when Charles Paxton, the
surveyor at Boston, appeared for that purpose in the Superior Court, February
term, 1761, he was confronted by a petition signed by sixty inhabitants
of the province, chiefly merchants of Boston, who desired to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
heard in opposition, in person and by their counsel, James Otis and Oxenbridge
Thacher. Otis, Advocate-General for the crown, had resigned his
office to avoid supporting the writ.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Gridley, the Attorney-General, appeared
in his stead. No complete report of the arguments has been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Gridley, who treated the question as purely one of law, to be determined
by statutes and precedents, said of Otis's argument, that "quoting
history is not speaking like a lawyer;" and as to the arbitrary nature of
the writ which allowed the entry of private houses in search of uncustomed
goods, he reminded him that by a province law a collector of taxes, without
execution, judgment, or trial, could arrest and throw a delinquent taxpayer
into prison. "What! shall my property be wrested from me? Shall
my liberty be destroyed by a collector for a debt unadjudged, without the
common indulgence and lenity of the law? So it is established; and the
necessity of having public taxes effectually and speedily collected is of infinitely
greater moment to the whole than the liberty of any individual."</p>

<p>Otis's argument is well known. Carried to its logical results, it was a
plea for commercial and political independence of the colonies, and was
fully vindicated by the result of the conflict it precipitated. But as a legal
argument it is less conclusive.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The majority of the court, however, were with Otis; and had judgment
been given at the time, the decision would have been in his favor. But
Hutchinson counselled delay until the practice in England could be
learned; and as it appeared that such writs were issued, of course, from
the Exchequer, on the 18th of November, the court, after re-argument, pronounced
them to be legal. Thenceforth they were freely used. Otis's argument,
without doubt, secured his election to the General Court in May, in
which his influence was second to that of no other in bringing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
struggle which ended in independence. Nor was its effect limited to Massachusetts.
It reached the remotest colonies, and, as John Adams said, led
to "the revolution in the principles, views, opinions, and feelings of the
American people."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Revolution, however, had been long impending. The treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
in October, 1748, which put an end to the long war between England
and France, opened with the declaration that "Europe sees the day
which the Divine Providence had pointed out for the reëstablishment of its
repose. A general peace succeeds to a long and bloody war." But neither
the peace, nor the treaty by which it was secured, was satisfactory to one
of the belligerents; for England had failed to secure the commercial advantages
for which the war had been undertaken, and the terms of the treaty,
requiring her to give hostages for the restoration of Cape Breton to France,
excited the indignation of the British people. Nor were other causes for
the renewal of the war wanting. The aggressive policy of France in
respect to the English possessions in Acadia and along the Ohio and the
Mississippi, notwithstanding the treaty, soon produced its legitimate results.
The Seven Years' War followed. In Asia and in the West Indies, the maritime
powers measured their strength by sea. At the same time in North
America, England and her colonies on the one side, and France on the
other, contended for the empire of the continent. Led by Clive, Wolfe,
Amherst, and Rodney, and inspired by the genius of Pitt, the forces of
England everywhere prevailed, and she took the first place among the
nations.</p>

<p>On the 10th of February, 1763, at Paris, was signed the treaty that recognized
the extinction of the French empire in North America. This
treaty marks an epoch in the history of America, as well as in that of
England and of France. To the latter it was a period of humiliation, not
only in the loss of colonies upon which, for nearly a century, she had
expended vast sums without any adequate return, but also in the frustration
of her purpose of gaining sole possession of the continent.</p>

<p>By England it was regarded as the close of a contest to maintain her
power on the same continent, and make it subservient to her commercial
and manufacturing interests, which had lasted for nearly a hundred years.
Yet there was a well-founded apprehension, expressed at the time, that her
colonies, relieved from the fear of French aggressions, would throw off the
authority of the mother country.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> What was the fear of the mother country,
on the other hand, was the hope and expectation, more or less remote,
of the colonies. For the experience gained in the French wars was of
great value to them in the revolutionary struggle. Officers had become
familiar with the direction of large bodies of troops, and with the means of
their transport and supply; and soldiers had learned that efficiency depended
upon discipline. Provincial assemblies also had been taught to
look for safety in strategic operations remote from their own territory. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
at no time before the assembling of the congress of 1754 had the colonies
been called to consider such a union of all as would give unity to military
operations, and secure the semblance, at least, of a general government.
The union proposed at that time would have involved some loss of independence,
without securing any efficient means of enforcing the recommendations
of the congress, and so the colonies hesitated, and finally laid
it aside. But there can be no doubt that the consideration given to it by
the several colonies led them more readily to come together for concerted
action in the congress of 1765.</p>

<p class="p2">The year 1763 is usually regarded as the beginning of the American
Revolution, because in that year the English ministry determined to raise
a revenue from the colonies. This led to a contest, which, like most civil
wars, was long and embittered. It engendered feelings which have not yet
passed away,&mdash;feelings which interfere with a calm and dispassionate
review of the motives of the parties concerned, and of the circumstances
which attended their controversy. It was a war between Britons and the
descendants of Britons, who, with a common ancestry, laws, and manners,
retained their essential race characteristics in spite of the lapse of time
or the change of place: everywhere and always lovers of liberty, but in
power haughty, insolent, and aggressive on the weak, and in subjection
turbulent and impatient of restraint; proud of ancestry, partial to old customs
and precedents, but quick to resist laws which impede the course of
equity, and never permitting forms to prevent the accomplishment of substantial
justice. Such was the parent and such was the child: and in the
light of these facts we are to read the history of the Revolution. It exhibited
the race in no new light, nor did the contest involve any new principle.
Its sentiments were expressed in the old idiomatic language,&mdash;petition,
remonstrance, riot, war.</p>

<p>For more than a hundred years the colonies had been regarded as appendages
to the crown rather than as an integral part of the empire; and
when Parliament, at the instigation of the mercantile classes and in derogation
of royal prerogative, began at the close of the seventeenth century
to assume control over them, and, a few years later, to vote large sums
from the imperial treasury for their protection, and, in some cases, for the
support of their civil governments, that body looked for reimbursement
to the profits which would inure to British merchants from the monopoly
of colonial trade and navigation, and flow indirectly into the national Exchequer.
But with the close of the French War a new policy seemed to
become necessary. The debt had swelled to frightful proportions. The
British people were groaning under the weight of the annual interest and
their current expenses. Every source of revenue seemed to be drained,
and the ministry turned their eyes for relief to the colonies; not, indeed,
for relief from the present debt, but from the necessity of adding to it the
whole expense of defending the colonies. This was the fatal mistake which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
precipitated the Revolution. On this subject, however, there seems to be
some misapprehension. The popular idea was, and still is, that the colonists
were to be taxed to pay the interest on the national debt and the
current expenses of the government, and that all moneys raised in the colonies
were to pass into the British Exchequer (thus draining them of their
specie), there to remain subject to the king's warrant. Such, however, was
not the scheme of the ministry. Not a farthing was to leave America. All
sums collected were to be deposited in the colonial treasuries, and only certificates
thereof were to be sent to the Exchequer. These were to be kept
apart from the general funds, and, after defraying the charges of the administration
of justice and the support of the civil government within all or any
of the colonies, they were to be subject to parliamentary appropriation for
their defence, protection, and security, and for no other purpose.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The alleged necessity was this: The government had broken the French
power in Canada, and shaken its hold upon the lakes and great rivers of
the West. This achievement, so glorious to the empire, and therefore to
the colonies as parts of it, and more immediately for their benefit, had
added one hundred and forty millions to the national debt, under which
the subjects within the realm were staggering. While some colonies had
been tardy or negligent in furnishing their quotas of men and money for
the war, yet it was acknowledged that as a whole they had borne their fair
proportion of the expense, and that some had exceeded their share. So far
all was clear. Although Canada had been conquered mainly for the colonies,
still the conquest added to the security and glory of the empire, and
the accounts for past expenditures were squared. But what of the future?
As these possessions had been acquired, a stable government was needed
for them, both for the safety of the colonies and for the honor of England.
They were still inhabited by Indians under French influence, and they
might become dangerous unless controlled by military power. Choiseul,
the great French minister, informed by the reports of his secret agent,
foresaw the complications likely to arise in the government of the colonies,
and was not without hope of retrieving by diplomacy the losses which had
occurred from war. Forts and garrisons were necessary. Although the
Northern colonies were comparatively secure, the Carolinas and Georgia
were menaced by powerful and hostile tribes. The government must regard
the colonies as a unit, of which all parts were entitled to imperial
protection. To this view of the case there could be no sound objection.
Twenty thousand troops,&mdash;Pitt thought more would be needed,&mdash;besides
civil officers to regulate such affairs as did not fall within colonial jurisdictions,
were to be sent to the colonies. At whose expense ought these
military and civil forces to be maintained? The British farmer objected
to pay for the protection of his untaxed colonial competitor in the British
market. If the colonies were to continue to be governed in the interest of
the mercantile classes, upon them might reasonably fall the expense of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
protection. But the acquisition of vast territories required a new policy,
and it was deemed equitable that they should be defended at the expense
of the empire of which the colonies were a part. They had claimed and
received imperial protection, and they ought to bear a proportional part of
the cost, which might be collected under the imperial authority with the
same certainty and promptness as were taxes on other subjects of the king.
This was the ministerial view of the matter as I gather it from the debates
in Parliament.</p>

<p>This claim of the ministry was met by the liberal party on both sides
of the water in two ways. It was asserted that the late war, and in fact
all the wars which affected the colonies, had been waged in the interest of
commerce and for the aggrandizement of the realm of which they were no
part, and that the newly acquired territories were of doubtful advantage
to colonies as yet sparsely populated. But if these considerations were
not conclusive, still the colonists ought not to be taxed, because the imperial
government by monopolizing their trade received far more than the
colonial share of the expense attending their defence. The liberals also
asserted that there was no disposition on the part of the colonists to seek
exemption from a reasonable share of these imperial expenses; but as in
the past they had voluntarily contributed their part, and in some cases even
more, so they would in the future; and that in the future, as in the past,
these contributions ought to be voluntary, and the frequency and amount
to be determined by the provincial assemblies. Moreover, as the colonists
neither had, nor could have, any equitable or efficient representation in the
imperial Parliament, they could not consent to have their property taken
from them by representatives not chosen by themselves.</p>

<p>The ministry and their adherents replied that the foregoing arguments,
even if sound, were such as no party charged with the administration of
affairs, and obliged to raise a certain amount of money from a people clamorous
for relief from present taxes, could accept; that no reliance could be
placed on voluntary contributions; that the necessities of government required
that money should be raised by some system which would act with
regularity and certainty, and reach the unwilling as well as the willing;
that even in the last war, when the existence of the English colonies was
threatened by a foe moving with celerity by reason of its unity, the movements
of English troops had been delayed by the backwardness of the colonies
in furnishing their quotas; and now that the pressure of the French
power was removed from New England, that section would leave the Middle
and Southern colonies to their own resources, especially when it was
remembered how remiss those colonies had been in assisting the north and
east when attacked.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It was also answered that so far from the monopoly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of the colonial trade being a set-off to the expenses incurred by the mother
country in defending the colonies, the fact was notorious that by the evasion
of the navigation laws and acts of trade the colonists had escaped
the restrictions intended by those laws, and at the same time had received
bounties and drawbacks from the British Exchequer which enabled them
to undersell the British merchants in the markets of Europe.</p>

<p>Here was a deadlock. The arguments on both sides seemed conclusive.
No practical solution of the difficulty was proposed at the time, nor has
been since. Both parties were firm in their convictions. Neither could
yield without the surrender of essential rights. A conflict was unavoidable
unless one party would relinquish the authority claimed by the imperial
government; unavoidable unless the colonies, essentially free by growth,
development, and distance, would yield to pretensions incompatible with
their rights as British subjects. The new policy contemplated after the
treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 was carried into effect after the treaty of
Paris in 1763. But nothing could have been more unfortunate than the
time at which Great Britain inaugurated this policy, and no ministers than
those by whom it was to be carried out. On essential political questions
which divided the colonists and the mother country Great Britain herself
was in the midst of a revolution. The new policy which was inaugurated
fell into the hands of those opposed to it. Whig ministers were charged
with the execution of an illiberal and reactionary scheme. Consequently,
the administration of American affairs was weak and vacillating. The result
was inevitable. Had Pitt, with his large views and great administrative abilities,
been at the head of affairs for ten years after the peace, the Revolution
might have been postponed. On the other hand, had the mercantile
system during the same period been administered with the unity of purpose
and thoroughness of measures which characterized Carleton's administration
in Canada, and had it been enforced by the military genius of
Clive, the rebellion might have been temporarily suppressed.</p>

<p>In the journals and statutes of the provincial assemblies we find from the
beginning a similarity of causes leading to the final rupture. There are
the same quarrels about the royal prerogative; the same repugnance to
the navigation laws and acts of trade; the same unwillingness to make
permanent provision for the support of the royal governors and judges,
and the same restiveness under interference with their internal affairs; but
owing either to differences in their original constitutions or of interests,
commercial and agricultural, or because of varied nationality and religion,
or by reason of all these causes combined, discontent was less general in
the Southern than in the Northern colonies. Of the Northern colonies, in
Massachusetts we find the causes which brought on the war operative and
continuous from the beginning. Party strife between friends and opponents
of prerogative existed in other colonies, but in Massachusetts the
conflict broke out with special virulence between the adherents of Otis and
those of Hutchinson. It was also intensified by the pecuniary interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of a large part of the inhabitants of Boston, which were affected by the
enforcement of the navigation laws through the aid of writs of assistance.
It was for this enforcement that Hutchinson was held responsible when the
mob sacked his house, and were ready to do violence to his person.</p>

<p>The province had received from the British Exchequer more than £60,000
sterling for the war expenses of 1759, and nearly £43,000 for those of 1761.
Money was plentiful, and more was expected from the same source. There
was a lull in the angry storm of local politics when news of the preliminaries
of peace reached Boston in January, 1763. With this came assurances
that Parliament would reimburse the colonies for expenses incurred,
beyond their proportion, in the last year of the war; and the two Houses
of the General Court agreed upon an address expressing gratitude to the
king for protection against the French power, and full of loyalty and duty.
But quiet was not of long continuance. The close of the war dried up several
sources of profitable trade or adventure,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>&mdash;some legal, such as furnishing
supplies to the king's forces, and some illicit. Then came orders
from the Board of Trade to enforce the navigation laws, heretofore chiefly
evaded, but now to be enforced with the aid of writs of assistance. At
the same time plans were entertained by the cabinet for making changes in
the constitutions of the colonies; and what was hardly less opportune, the
English bishops incessantly pressed upon the ministry the adoption of archbishop
Secker's scheme of introducing an episcopal hierarchy into America,
which would have carried with it some of the worst features of the prerogative.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
The history of the period from the treaty of 1763 to the meeting
of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia in 1774 is a narrative of an
attempt by the British ministry to enforce certain measures upon unwilling
colonists, and of the resistance of the colonists to those measures. Who
were the ministers, what were their measures, and how did the colonists
resist them?</p>

<p>Pitt had carried the country through a long and glorious war; but he
was not satisfied with the results. The cost had been heavy, and as a
guaranty against future expense he meditated the substantial annihilation
of the French power. He knew that France and Spain had entered into
the Family Compact with a view to a war with England. War with Spain
was only a question of time, and he would have anticipated its declaration
by seizing the immense treasure belonging to that power, then on the sea.
This would have replenished the British Exchequer, and perhaps have deferred
a resort to American taxation. Pitt urged this measure at a cabinet
meeting, September 18, 1761. His advice was not followed, and he resigned
October 5. But war was declared against Spain, January 1, 1762, and carried
on with brilliant results, though the golden opportunity of securing
the Spanish treasure was lost. The preliminaries of peace were signed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Fontainebleau, November 3, 1763.</p>

</div></div>

<p>This virtually ended Pitt's connection
with the ministry and with the conduct of American affairs as a leader;
for although he was again at the head of the ministry from August 2, 1766,
to October, 1768, his direction was merely nominal. It was during his
administration that the Townshend Acts were passed, and the Mutiny Act
extended to the colonies,&mdash;facts which show divided counsels and the lack
of uniform purpose. Pitt seldom appeared in the ministry except to oppose
his own government. Whenever his great powers were most needed by
sore-pressed colleagues to devise some practicable policy for replenishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the Exchequer, or for governing the colonies, he was in the country wrestling
with the gout. This was a serious loss to the mother country, but
it hastened the independence of America.</p>

<p>The terms of peace with France were settled by Bute and Bedford,
against the views of Pitt; but on April 16, 1763, Bute retired from the
ministry, before the new policy for the government of the colonies had been
fully developed. He was succeeded by George Grenville, who continued
at the head of the government until July, 1765.
Grenville was able, well informed, and thoroughly
honest. His knowledge of financial matters was
extensive and accurate, and, as Chancellor of the
Exchequer during the preceding administration,
he had become familiar with the difficulties of
providing for the expenses of government. No
question could have been more perplexing at this
time. A certain amount of revenue was required
to meet the interest on the public debt, and to defray
current expenses. Economic theories of commercial
policy would not serve as an item in the
budget. The minister needed the money, and the
Stamp Act was framed and passed. He also encountered
other difficulties when public sentiment had become inflamed by
the question of General Warrants. His relations to the king were unfriendly.
Pitt threw his influence into the scale of the opposition, and
Grenville's administration was a failure.</p>

</div>

<p>The Rockingham ministry began July 13, 1765, and ended August 2, 1766.
The colonists themselves could hardly have chosen one more to their mind.
It was weak and vacillating. It
repealed the Stamp Act, and
passed the Declaratory Bill. To
Dowdswell, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, the Massachusetts
House voted their thanks. Then
came the Chatham-Grafton ministry,
which was in power until
December 31, 1769. This was
nominally Pitt's ministry; but his elevation to the peerage impaired his
influence with the people, and after nine months he retired from public
affairs by reason of ill health. Men of such opposite views and character as
Shelburne, Hillsborough, Charles Townshend, and Lord North were of this
ministry.</p>

<p>Lord North was premier from February 10, 1770, to September 6, 1780.
Long after he wished to retire he continued to hold power at the personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
solicitation, and even by the command, of the king. He was able, faithful,
and patriotic; but his heart was not in the work of subduing the colonies,
nor could he pilot the ship of state through dangerous seas.</p>

<p>Such were the ministers at one of the most critical periods in English
history. No first-class man is to be found among them save Pitt, and his
real attitude was that of opposition. He raised the storm, but when his
hand ought to have been on the helm he was prostrate in the cabin.</p>

<p>Nor were the governors of Massachusetts, during a period when affairs
needed a firm hand, although worthy gentlemen, altogether such as a far-seeing
ministry would have chosen to carry out the new policy. Shirley
was the only governor of Massachusetts who possessed the favor of the
people; and yet he believed in the king's prerogative, and valued himself
highly as its representative. He endeavored to suppress illicit trade and to
enforce the navigation laws; and from his conferences with Franklin, it is
certain that he contemplated some radical changes in the constitutions of
the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But he got more money from the people for public uses than
any previous governor, and even persuaded them to pass a provincial stamp
act.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The secret of Shirley's influence may have been that he was less
eager to secure his own salary than some of his predecessors had shown
themselves to be, and that he had displayed unequalled activity in conducting
the French war, which engaged the attention of the people. Pownall,
who succeeded Shirley, belonged to the popular party. He gave no particular
attention to the navigation laws, and was on the opposite side from
Hutchinson, who was lieutenant-governor during the latter part of his term,
which closed in 1760.</p>

<p>After Pownall came Bernard, and with him the beginning of the Revolution.
Bernard was not without ability, accomplishments, and good intentions;
but he was a Tory. More firmly even than Shirley, he believed in
the royal prerogatives, and in some modification of the provincial charters
to bring their action into harmony with the imperial system. During his
administration, and in some cases at his suggestion, the ministry entered
upon that series of measures which lost the colonies to Great Britain: the
enforcement of the navigation laws; the use of writs of assistance; Grenville's
revenue acts in 1764; the Stamp Act of 1765; the Townshend duties
of 1767; and the arrival of military forces in 1768.</p>

<p>The purposes contemplated by these successive administrations were not
unreasonable, nor were the measures by which they sought to accomplish
them unwise in themselves. The general policy was the same as that afterwards
pursued by the colonies when they had become a great empire,&mdash;homogeneity,
equal contributions to expenses, a preference for their own
shipping, and protection to their own industries.</p>

<p>The difficulty arose from a misconception of the relations of the colonies
to the mother country. They were not a part of the realm, and could
neither equally share its privileges nor justly bear its burdens. The attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to bring them within imperial legislation failed, and could only fail. They
were colonies; and the chief benefit the parent state could legitimately derive
from them was the trade which would flow naturally to Great Britain
by reason of the political connection, and would increase with the prosperity
of the colonies.</p>

<p>Early in 1763 the Bute ministry, of which George Grenville and Charles
Townshend were members, entered upon the new policy. To enforce the
navigation laws, armed cutters cruised about the British coast and along
the American shores; their officers, for the first time, and much to their
disgust, being required to act as revenue officers. To give unity to their
efforts, an admiral was stationed on the coast. To adjudicate upon seizures
of contraband goods, and other offences against the revenue, a vice-admiralty
court, with enlarged jurisdiction, and sitting without juries, was
set up.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Royal governors, hitherto chiefly occupied with domestic administration,
were now obliged to watch the commerce of an empire. It was
seen long before this time that the successful administration of the new
system would require some modification of the provincial charters; but the
difficulties were so serious that the matter was deferred.</p>

<p>Such was the new order of things. The student who reflects upon the
complete and radical change effected or threatened by these new measures,
so much at variance with the habits and customary rights of the colonists,
breaking up without notice not only illicit but legitimate trade, and sweeping
away their commercial prosperity, is no longer at loss to account for the
outburst of wrath which followed the Stamp Act, a year later.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> To avert
these hostile proceedings, the colonists memorialized the king and Parliament.
They employed resident agents to act in their behalf. They availed
themselves of party divisions and animosities in England. They alarmed
British merchants by non-importation and self-denying agreements. When
these measures seemed likely to prove ineffectual, they aroused public sentiment
through the press, by public gatherings and legislative resolutions,
by committees of correspondence between towns and colonies, and finally
by continental congresses. They did not scruple to avail themselves of
popular violence, nor, in the last extremity, of armed resistance to British
authority.</p>

<p>So far as trade and commerce were concerned, it was a struggle between
British and colonial merchants. The colonial merchants desired freedom
of commerce; the British merchant desired its monopoly. But this does
not state the case precisely; for the colonial merchants were desirous of
retaining what they possessed rather than of acquiring something new.
By the navigation laws the British merchant had a legal monopoly of certain
specified trades; but by evading these laws, the colonial merchants
had gained a large part of this trade for themselves. One party, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
on legal rights, wished to recover this lost trade; the other party, basing
their claim on natural equity and long enjoyment, wished to retain it. This
was an old question, a hundred years old; but it had acquired new interest
since the government, with the aid of writs of assistance, had undertaken
to enforce the navigation laws and acts of trade. Such was the first
issue between the parties. The second was this, and it was new: As has
been said, Great Britain had never undertaken to raise a revenue from the
colonies, though she had often contemplated doing so, and especially during
the French war just closed. At the close of the war it was estimated that
£300,000 would be required to man the forts about to be vacated by the
French, and to maintain twenty regiments to hold the Indians in check,
who were still under French influence and might become dangerous, as
happened in Pontiac's time; and to give efficiency to civil administration
by granting to governors, judges, and some other officers fixed and regular
salaries, instead of having them depend on irregular and fluctuating
grants of colonial assemblies. One third of these expenses&mdash;£100,000&mdash;the
ministry proposed to raise by laying duties on importations, reserving a
direct tax by stamps for fuller consideration.</p>

<p>The colonists met this proposition by denying both the necessity and
the right of raising a revenue,&mdash;at first distinguishing between external
and internal taxes, and finally objecting to all taxes raised by a Parliament
in which they neither were nor practically could be represented. These
issues were complicated with several others of long standing, but which
may be left out of the account here.</p>

<p>The popular idea has been that the Revolution began with the Stamp
Act. But it seems strange that prosperous colonists, in whose behalf the
British people had expended £60,000,000 sterling, should refuse to pay
£100,000, one third of the sum deemed necessary for their future defence,
and that months before they were called upon to raise the first penny they
should fall into a paroxysm of rage, from one end of the continent to the
other, and commit disgraceful acts of violence upon property and against
persons of the most estimable character.</p>

<p>This view, however, overlooks several facts. If we disregard the chronic
quarrels in all the colonies, growing out of the exercise of the royal prerogatives,
Virginia and Massachusetts especially had been aroused on the
abstract questions concerning the relations of the colonies to Great Britain,
and in them the earliest demonstrations of hostility to the Stamp Act were
manifested. In the famous "Parsons Case" argued by Patrick Henry in December,
1763, in words which rang through Virginia because they affected
every man in that colony, he drew the prerogative into question, not only
in regard to the ecclesiastical supremacy of the Anglican hierarchy, but also
on the right of the king to negative the "Two-penny Act" of the colonial
assembly. In Massachusetts, James Otis, in 1761, arguing the writs of assistance,
assumed the natural rights of the colonists to absolute independence.
But the promulgation of none of these theories of abstract rights accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
for the general outbreak in 1765. Its most potent influence was the enforcement
of the navigation acts in the great commercial centres, and the ruin
threatening New England through the breaking up of her trade with the
French West Indies and the Spanish Main<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> by the modification of the Sugar
Act in 1764. The staples of New England were fish, cattle, and lumber.
The better quality of fish found a market in Europe, but this trade was subject
to competition. For the poorer quality the chief market was in the
French West Indies, where by the French law it could be exchanged only
for molasses. This was shipped to New England, and used not only in its
raw state, but distilled into rum, which, besides supplying home consumption,
was to some extent exported to Africa in exchange for slaves. This
trade and commerce with the Spanish Main was the chief source of the
wealth of New England. But in 1733, to protect the sugar industry of
the English West India islands, a duty amounting to prohibition was laid
on all sugar and molasses imported into the American colonies from the
French islands. So long as this act was not enforced, it did little harm;
but if enforced, it would not only ruin the trade in rum and lumber, but
injure the fisheries also, for the English islands were limited in population
and had no liking for poor fish. The French, besides being more numerous,
were less particular as to their diet; but if they could not sell molasses,
they would not buy fish. It was proposed to modify and enforce this
act. Minot<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> says: "The business of the fishery, which, it was alleged,
would be broken up by the act, was at this time estimated in Massachusetts
at £164,000 sterling per annum; the vessels employed in it, which
would be nearly useless, at £100,000; the provisions used in it, the casks
for packing fish, and other articles, at £22,700 and upwards; to all which
there was to be added the loss of the advantage of sending lumber, horses,
provisions, and other commodities to the foreign plantations as cargoes,
the vessels employed to carry fish to Spain and Portugal, the dismissing of
5000 seamen from their employment, the effects of the annihilation of the
fishery upon the trade of the province and of the mother country in general,
and its accumulative evils by increasing the rival fisheries of France.
This was forcibly urged as it respected the means of remittances to England
for goods imported into the province, which had been made in specie
to the amount of £150,000 sterling, beside £90,000 in the treasurer's bills
for the reimbursement money, within the last eighteen months. The sources
for obtaining this money were through foreign countries by the means of
the fishery, and would be cut off with the trade to their plantations." This
was what the enforcement of the molasses act meant. Neither the duties
laid in 1764 nor the collection of the taxes anticipated from the Stamp Act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of 1765 would have produced a tithe of the evil that would have followed.
John Adams,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> confirming the statement of Minot, says: "The strongest
apprehensions arose from the publication of the orders for the strict execution
of the molasses act, which is said to have caused a greater alarm in
the country than the taking of Fort William Henry did in the year 1757."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Rumors of the intention of the ministry had been rife for some time, and
in January, 1764, the Massachusetts Assembly wrote to their agent in London
that the officers of the customs, in pursuance of orders from the Lords
of the Treasury, had lately given public notice that the act, in all its parts,
would be carried into execution, and that the consequences would be ruinous
to the trade of the province, hurtful to all the colonies, and greatly
prejudicial to the mother country.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Besides the rumors of the modification of the Sugar Act came others
respecting new duties, and a Stamp Act. In its alarm, the General Court
determined to send Hutchinson to London as special agent, to prevent, if
possible, the intended legislation. He was in favor of allowing the colonies
the freest trade, but acknowledged the supremacy of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> No man
knew the colonies better, or was better able to present their just claims,
than Hutchinson. He had much at stake in the colony in which he was
born, and to which he had rendered many and honorable services. No man
loved her better, or was more worthy of honor from her. He was chosen
by both Houses; but Governor Bernard suggested doubts as to the expediency
of his going to England without the special leave of the king; and
subsequently the project was laid aside in consequence of some rising suspicions
as to his political sentiments.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Ruin threatened New England. A Stamp Act was not needed to set
her aflame; and the other colonies soon had reasons of their own for joining
her in the general opposition. All parties were agreed as to the danger,
but they differed as to the remedy.</p>

<p>The reports which reached America in the winter of 1764, respecting
the intentions of the ministry to raise a revenue from the colonies, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
verified in the following spring. The substance of Grenville's resolutions
(with the exception of that respecting stamps, which was laid aside for the
present) became a law April 6, 1764. Bancroft has summarized this act
as "a bill modifying and perpetuating the act of 1733, with some changes
to the disadvantage of the colonies; an extension of the navigation acts,
making England the storehouse of Asiatic as well as of European supplies;
a diminution of drawbacks on foreign articles exported to America; imposts
in America, especially on wines; a revenue duty instead of a prohibitory
duty on foreign molasses; an increased duty on sugar; various regulations
to restrain English manufactures, as well as to enforce more diligently
acts of trade; a prohibition of all trade between America and St.
Pierre and Miquelon."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Organized opposition to the ministerial measures began in Boston, and
perhaps, at that time, could have begun nowhere else. For not only were
the interests of that town, in the fisheries, trade, and navigation, the most
considerable in the colonies, but there, as nowhere else in the same degree,
for more than a century, had been operative causes of dissatisfaction connected
with the navigation acts, the exercise of the royal prerogatives, and
ecclesiastical affairs; and in no other section had Otis's declaration of the
general principles of liberty found such ready acceptance.</p>

<p>The Grenville Act of April, 1764, was to take effect September 30.
News of its passage had scarcely arrived in Boston before the citizens in
town meeting, May 24, voted instructions<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> to their representatives in the
General Court, which had been presented by Samuel Adams. They were
directed to endeavor to prevent proceedings designed to curtail their trade,
and to impose new taxes,&mdash;"for if their trade might be taxed, why not their
lands?"&mdash;and to obtain from the General Assembly all needed advice and
instruction, so that their agent in London might effectually "demonstrate
for them all those rights and privileges which justly belonged to them
either by charter or birth." Since the other colonies were equally interested,
their representatives were also to endeavor to obtain coöperation in
that direction.</p>

<p>Thus at the very outset the patriots sought counsel and union with the
sister colonies. These instructions were scattered far and wide. The
General Court came in on the 30th. June 1, letters from the London
agent were referred to a committee of which Otis was one. On the 8th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<i>The Rights of the British Colonies</i> was read,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and again on the 12th, when
it was referred to the committee of which Otis was a member.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> On the
13th a letter to Mauduit, their agent, was reported, which must have made
his ears tingle,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> for it was a scathing rebuke for neglect and inefficiency
in not preventing the injurious legislation, and for making unwarranted
concessions in behalf of the colony.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Otis went over the whole question
of colonial rights and grievances, but by implication he admitted that representation
in Parliament would prove satisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The same committee
was directed to correspond with the other governments, requesting coöperation
in their endeavors to effect the repeal of the Sugar Act and to
prevent the Stamp Act. The letter of the committee, drawn by Otis,
together with his <i>Rights of the Colonies</i>, was sent to the agent in London,
to make the best use of them in his power. As this action taken by the
House of Representatives, which did not seek the concurrence of the
Council as usual, was not regarded as judicious by the moderate party,
the governor was induced to call the General Court together on the 12th
of October. In the mean time the temper of the merchants had become
soured by revenue seizures to the amount of £3,000.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The General Court (November 3), in answer to the governor's speech,
elaborately discussed the act of Parliament, and the same day agreed upon
a petition to the House of Commons, setting forth the injurious nature of
the new measures and of the navigation laws, as well as deprecating their
enforcement. This was accompanied by a letter to their agent, showing
historically the services and expenses of the colony in various wars, and
their willingness to share in the defence of the empire.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> These papers&mdash;the
petition and the letter&mdash;were drawn up by Hutchinson; but though
able, candid, and convincing, their tone did not satisfy the more ardent
patriots, especially when they were contrasted with Otis's fiery letter to
the agent in June, or when compared with similar documents emanating
from some other colonies,&mdash;that of New York in particular: for the discontent
of the colonies, to which the Boston instructions doubtless contributed,
was general, and manifested itself in petitions, remonstrances, and
correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The events of 1764 left no doubt as to the manner in which the people
would receive the Stamp Act of 1765; nor, although with grievances
of their own, were they unobservant of what was going on in England.
"Wilkes and Liberty" was a familiar cry in Boston as well as in London,
and the names Whig and Tory became terms of reproach.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the memorials and petitions of the colonial assemblies,
and the remonstrances of their agents in London, George Grenville persevered
in his determination to bring in a stamp bill. Since its first suggestion,
he had listened patiently to the colony agents and other friends of
America; but they proposed nothing better, or so good, if the colonies were
to be taxed at all. They admitted that the stamp tax would be inexpensive
in its collection, and general in its effect upon different classes of people.
Indeed, so little did the agents understand the real feeling in America that
they&mdash;and Franklin was among them&mdash;were quite ready, when the time
came, to solicit positions as stamp-distributors for their friends, and Richard
Henry Lee even asked a place for himself.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> February 6, 1765, Grenville
introduced his resolutions for a Stamp Act, and put forward his plan
in a carefully prepared speech. Colonel Barré's opposition called forth
the well-known question of Charles Townshend, and the still more famous
rejoinder of the former. Pitt was away and ill. The debate occupied but
one session of the Commons, and the ministers were directed to bring in a
bill, which was done on the 13th. Numerous petitions against it, presented
by colonial agents, were rejected under the rule which allowed no petition
against a money bill. The bill passed both Houses, and on March 22
received the royal assent. But in America there was no apathy. If there
had been a calm, it presaged the coming storm. The passage of the bill
was known in America before the end of May, and from Virginia came
the first legislative response. She spoke through the voice of her great
orator. Of Patrick Henry's six resolutions, though supported by a powerful
speech, only four, however, were carried, May 30, by a small majority,
in a House in which the Established Church and the old aristocracy were
very powerful.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The General Court of Massachusetts did not meet until May 27, but set
to work so promptly that the House, June 6, under the lead of James
Otis, who had recovered from a fit of vacillation, voted that it was highly
expedient that there should be a meeting, as soon as might be, of committees
from the several colonial assemblies, "to consult together on the
present circumstances of the colonies, and the difficulties to which they are
and must be reduced by operation of the late acts of Parliament for levying
duties and taxes on the colonies." It was agreed to send them a circular
letter to that effect, recommending a congress, in the city of New York,
the first Tuesday of October. This measure, which led to the Stamp
Act Congress, was pushed through with an unanimous vote of the House
(June 6), though probably not with the equally concordant opinion of the
members; and the circular, which was dated June 8, was immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
dispatched.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> James Otis, Oliver Partridge, and Timothy Ruggles&mdash;the last
two having little heart in the matter&mdash;were chosen delegates. The response
to the Massachusetts circular was neither unanimous, nor, from
some of the assemblies, enthusiastic.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> At this stage of the Revolution, in
high offices and in provincial assemblies were friends of the royal government
able to make their influence felt in opposition to popular measures.
Nine of the colonies, however, were represented in the congress, and from
others came expressions of good-will. In the mean time public sentiment
was rapidly shaping itself into violent opposition to the act. In Boston the
Sons of Liberty were on the alert. When the name of Andrew Oliver
appeared among the stamp-distributors he was hanged in effigy from the
Liberty Tree on the night of the 13th of August; and the next night the
frame of a building going up on his land, and supposed to be intended as a
stamp-office, was broken in pieces and used to consume the effigy before his
own door.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> On the 26th of the same month the records of the hated Vice-Admiralty
Court were burned by the mob, the house of the comptroller of
the customs sacked, and that of Chief Justice Hutchinson forcibly entered
and left in ruins. His plate and money were carried off, and his books and
valuable manuscripts were thrown into the streets. Nor did he or his family
escape without difficulty. The militia were not called out to maintain
order, for many of the privates were in the mob. Men of standing secretly
connived at proceedings which they afterwards insincerely condemned.
Though these violent outbreaks came earlier and were carried to greater
excess in Massachusetts than in any other province, similar demonstrations
followed in Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>When the Stamp Act Congress met in New York, October 7, 1765, that
city was the headquarters of the British forces in America, under the command
of General Gage. Lieutenant-Governor Colden, then filling the executive
chair, was in favor of the act, and resolved to execute it; but the Sons
of Liberty expressed different sentiments. The Congress contained men
some of whom became celebrated. Timothy Ruggles was chosen speaker,
but Otis was the leading spirit. In full accord with him were the Livingstons
of New York, Dickinson of Pennsylvania, McKean and Rodney of
Delaware, Tilghman of Maryland, and Rutledge and the elder Lynch of
South Carolina. New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia
failed to send delegates, but not for lack of interest in the cause. The
Congress prepared a Declaration of Rights and Grievances, An Address to
the King, a Memorial to the House of Lords, and a Petition to the House
of Commons, and adjourned on October 25th. For a clear, accurate, and
calm statement of the position of the colonies these papers were never surpassed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
nor, until the appearance of the Declaration of Independence, was
any advance made from the ground taken in them.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>It is not to be inferred from the results of their proceedings that there
were no differences of opinion among the delegates. Several of them afterwards
took sides with the king; and there was doubtless diversity of sentiment
on the Stamp Act, as well as in Parliament, which reassembled
January 14, 1766, under a different ministry from that which had carried
the measure less than a year before. For in a few months after the passage
of the act, George III., chiefly on personal grounds, had changed his
legal advisers. After negotiations with Pitt had failed, a new ministry, with
the Marquis of Rockingham as chief, and the Duke of Grafton and General
Conway as Secretaries of State, was installed, July
13, 1765. It was a Whig ministry. With it, though
not of it, was associated Edmund Burke, private secretary
of Rockingham, and not long after, through
his influence, a member of the House of Commons.
This change of the ministry was regarded with favor
by the colonists, and doubtless encouraged their
resistance to the Stamp Act. The action of the colonists
produced a great effect on the new ministry,
and alarmed the British merchants trading with
America. Their trade had been threatened by non-importation
agreements made to take effect January 1,
1766, and their debts were imperilled by the
determination of the colonists to withhold the amount of them as pledges
for good conduct. The general confusion likely to arise in the administration
of justice, and the transactions of the custom-house, from want of
stamps, brought the ministry to their wits' end. Parliament assembled
December 17th. But notwithstanding an effort by Grenville to bring on a
general consideration of American affairs, the subject was postponed until
after the holidays.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the mean time some embarrassment was anticipated from the want
of stamps, November 1,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> when the act was to go into operation. Governor
Bernard (September 25) had called the attention of the House of
Representatives to the courts, which guarded the property and persons of
the inhabitants, and to the custom-houses, upon which depended legal trade
and navigation. The House, in its answer, October 23, had not shared
his excellency's apprehensions, but was not then quite ready to say, as it
said three months later (January 17, 1766), "The courts of justice must be
open,&mdash;open immediately,&mdash;and the law, the great rule of right in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
county of the province, executed."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> But this attitude had not been taken
without intermediate steps. In December the town of Boston presented
a petition to the governor and council for the reopening of the courts, which
was supported by John Adams, who then first publicly identified himself
with the patriot cause, of which he became one of the most efficient advocates.
After some delay and inconvenience, the courts and custom-houses
throughout the colonies, early in the spring, took the risk of proceeding
without stamped papers, trusting to find their justification in necessity.</p>

<p>Parliament reassembled January 14, 1766. The king's speech opened with
a reference to "affairs in America, and Mr. Secretary Conway laid before
the House of Commons important letters and papers on the same subject."
On the 17th a petition of the merchants of London trading with North
America against the Stamp Act was presented. Then (January 28) followed
the examination of Franklin, in relation to the Stamp Act, before
the House, in committee.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> With this mass of information before them,
American affairs received an exhaustive discussion. The Stamp Act was
repealed, and the royal assent was given March 18th. The debates on
the Declaratory Act were no less full. It was a memorable session,&mdash;memorable
for the first speech of Burke; for those great speeches of Pitt
which placed him at the head of modern orators, for Grenville's masterly
defence of his colonial policy, and for Franklin's examination. It was also
memorable for the constitutional discussions of Mansfield and Camden in
the House of Lords. If the reader finds it difficult to resist Mansfield's
judicial interpretation of the British Constitution adverse to the American
claim, he recognizes in the great principles then enunciated the force which
popularized that Constitution and marked a forward movement of the British
race.</p>

<p>The Declaratory Act&mdash;that the king, with the advice of Parliament, had
full power to make laws binding America in all cases whatsoever&mdash;was
passed. This gave Pitt some trouble, considering his emphatic declaration
in that regard; but the liberal party in the colonies soon met it with
the counter-affirmation that Parliament possessed no authority whatever in
America except by consent of the provincial assemblies. If the colonists
had not forced the British government from its position, they had advanced
from their own. The repeal, however, caused great rejoicing on both sides
of the Atlantic. British merchants expected no further trouble from non-importation
agreements, and hoped that the colonists would now pay their
debts,&mdash;amounting to £4,000,000. But there were misgivings on both
sides. The ardent patriots were outspoken in condemning the Declaratory
Act, which Franklin had thought would give no trouble. But the act of
1764, laying duties, remained; and the enforcement of the navigation laws&mdash;their
real grievance&mdash;lost none of its vigor. Governor Bernard was
under instructions to enforce the laws against illicit trade; and in addition
to these official obligations, his share in the forfeitures of condemned
goods laid his motives open to suspicion. Nothing could have been more
unfortunate for his administration. It was also alleged that merchants
were encouraged in schemes to defraud the revenue; and that when their
ships and cargoes were compromised, they were seized and condemned. At
a time when conciliatory measures were needed to reassure the colonists,
the harshest were followed. Nevertheless, the repeal weakened the prerogative
party on both sides of the water, and encouraged the liberal party
by a knowledge of its power.</p>

<p>Governor Bernard opened the General Court, May 29, 1766, with congratulations
on the repeal of the Stamp Act. If he had stopped there he
would have acted wisely; but he alluded to the "fury of the people" in
their treatment of Hutchinson, and to some personal matters, which called
forth a reply from the House couched in terms showing no abatement of
animosity. This was increased on the receipt of another message from the
governor (June 3), enclosing the Act of Repeal and the Declaratory Act,
and at the same time informing them that he had been directed by Secretary
Conway to recommend "that full and ample compensation be made
to the late sufferers by the madness of the people", agreeably to the votes of
the House of Commons. He also complained of their exclusion of the
principal crown officers from the Council by non-election.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The General
Court promptly availed themselves of this last topic for reply, instead of
committing themselves on the matter of compensation. They did not fail,
however, to vote a politic address of thanks to the king for assenting to the
repeal of the Stamp Act, and to offer their grateful acknowledgments to
Pitt and those members of the two Houses who had advocated it.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> But
the subject of compensation could not be passed by. The governor urged
prompt compliance with the recommendation of Conway. The House,
however, professing the greatest abhorrence of the madness and barbarity
of the rioters, and promising their endeavors "to bring the perpetrators
of so horrid a fact to exemplary justice, and, if it be in their power, to
a pecuniary restitution of all damages", regarded compensation by the
province as not an act of justice, but rather of generosity, and wished to
consult their constituents. Therefore they referred the matter to the next
session.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>In December the two Houses passed a bill granting compensation to
those who had suffered losses in the Stamp Act riots, but, on the suggestion
of Joseph Hawley, accompanied it with a general pardon, indemnity
and oblivion to the offenders. Why they should have been so solicitous for
the safety of those who had committed crimes, condemned in June in the
severest terms, does not appear; and this invasion of the royal prerogative
of pardon did not fail to attract the attention of the Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>In the late contest with Parliament the colonists had gained a victory,
but it was neither final nor precisely on the right ground. As a matter of
practical politics, they were ready to accept Pitt's distinction between commercial
regulations and internal taxes. They took the repeal of the Stamp
Act with thanks, but not as a finality. They participated in the lively demonstrations
of joy which followed that event on both sides of the Atlantic;
but thoughtful observers on both sides perceived that one of the most
powerful agencies in effecting the repeal was the mercantile class, which
had no intention of relinquishing its grasp upon colonial commerce. Nor
was the popular feeling without guidance. It was the good fortune of the
colonists, all through the long contest, to have statesmen like John Adams,
Jay, and Dickinson, who could supplement the passionate appeals of Otis
and some of his associates with the calm reasons of political philosophy.
None rendered more valuable services in this respect than John Adams.
In a series of papers which appeared in the <i>Boston Gazette</i> in the summer
and fall of 1765,&mdash;when the minds of the people were inflamed by
the Stamp Act,&mdash;and were afterwards republished in London as <i>A Dissertation
on the Canon and Feudal Law</i>, he combated the ecclesiastical and
feudal principles which lay at the bottom of the monarchical and Anglican
system.</p>

<p>The substantial grievance of the commercial colonies was not the Stamp
Act, which had not taken a farthing from their pockets. It was the enforcement
of trade regulations, which impaired the value of the fisheries
and dried up a principal source of revenue. A renewal of the contest,
and for the first time on its true grounds, was not long postponed. The
Rockingham ministry gave way, and Pitt, gazetted Earl of Chatham July
30, 1766, took the helm of state August 2d, and was the nominal head of
the government until October, 1768. Among those associated with him
were the Duke of Grafton, Charles Townshend, Conway, and the Earl of
Shelburne. It was Pitt's misfortune&mdash;and his country's&mdash;during these
stormy times, that when he was most needed he was disabled by sickness.
Historians have speculated as to the probable pacification of America had
Pitt&mdash;not Chatham&mdash;guided affairs.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Pitt's was a great name in America
as well as in Europe. By his genius the French power in America had
been destroyed. This the colonists knew. He had been generous in reimbursing
their expenses in the late war. This, and his efforts in effecting the
repeal of the Stamp Act, they remembered with gratitude. Whatever man
could do in restoring things to their old order Pitt could have done. He
might even have relinquished something of his claims for parliamentary
supremacy in respect to trade and general legislation; but it is doubtful
whether, even at that early period, he could have eradicated the ideas of independence
which had taken possession of the colonists, or have arrested
the movement which resulted in the independence of America and the overthrow
of the royal prerogative in England.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Assembly
was in no amiable frame of mind. When there was no cause for quarrel,
they made one. Bernard had probably been advised to preserve a prudent
silence respecting political affairs. At the opening of the session, January
28, 1767, in a message of less than ten printed lines, he recommended "the
support of the authority of the government, the maintenance of the honor
of the province, and the promotion of the welfare of the people", as the
chief objects for their consultation. This called forth a captious reply, and
a complaint because Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, who had not been
reëlected to the Council, appeared in the council-chamber at the opening of
the session, at the request of the governor and as matter of courtesy. The
House found in his presence, if voluntary, "a new and additional instance
of ambition and lust of power."</p>

<p>In the spring of 1767, Parliament had occasion to inquire into some colonial
legislation. In April, 1765, the Mutiny Act had been extended to the
colonies. This was intended in part to provide for military offences not
within the jurisdiction of civil courts, and in part to require the colonies in
America, as in England in like cases, to provide for quartering the king's
troops. The New York Assembly made only partial provision. When Sir
Henry Moore, the governor, communicated to them the letter of Earl Shelburne,
to the effect that the king expected obedience to the act, the Assembly
resolved not to comply, and called in question the authority of Parliament.
Parliament then took the matter in hand, and suspended their legislative
authority until compliance.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> This action brought them to terms. It
made considerable stir throughout the colonies, and was regarded as a serious
invasion of their rights.</p>

<p>The arrival of several companies of royal artillery at Boston, in the fall of
1766, and the quartering of them at the expense of the province, by order of
the governor and council, gave the General Court occasion, at their session
in January, 1767, to express their opinion about unauthorized expenditures
of the public money, and to enquire if more troops were expected.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The
governor explained the quartering of the troops, and said he had no expectation,
except from common rumor, of the arrival of additional forces. But
his statement failed to allay apprehensions of a design on the part of the
ministry to support their measures by military power. Added to other causes
of alarm in 1767 was a report that Anglican bishops were about to be supported
in the colonies, at the expense and under the patronage of the British
government.</p>

<p>In 1767 strife was renewed on what are known as the Townshend Acts.
Charles Townshend was Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Chatham-Grafton
ministry. He had reluctantly voted for the repeal of the Stamp
Act, and still held to his opinions that the colonists should pay some share
of the civil and military expenses arising from their defence and government;
and if, to secure promptness and uniformity of action, some modification
of their charters should be found necessary, then that ought to
follow. In conformity with these views, he had given some pledges in
respect to deriving a revenue from America, and, during Chatham's retirement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
had brought forward his scheme of taxation in certain resolutions of
the Committee of Ways and Means, April 16, 1767,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> the substance of which
was enacted June 29th, to go into effect November 20th. There were two
acts known as the Townshend Acts: the first<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> providing for the more
effectual execution of the laws of trade, and for the appointment of commissioners
for that purpose; and the second<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> granting duties on glass, paper,
colors, and tea, and legalizing writs of assistance. The revenue thus raised
was to be applied to "defraying the charge of the administration of justice,
and the support of the civil government in such provinces where it
should be found necessary; and towards further defraying the expenses of
defending, protecting, and securing the said dominions." Before the act
went into operation Charles Townshend died (September 4, 1767), and
Chatham's powers continued to be enfeebled by disease. It was the misfortune
of Great Britain that both these able men should have been withdrawn
from the public service during this critical period, and that the
policy of each had to be represented by inferior men. Chatham's conciliatory
methods had no fair trial; and Townshend's coercive measures were
pressed neither with unity of purpose nor vigor of execution.</p>

<p>Between the passage of Townshend's Acts in the summer of 1767 and
their taking effect in November, the colonists had ample time to study and
organize opposition, stimulated by the arrival (November 5, 1767) of Burch
and Hulton, two of the five commissioners of customs who had been sent
over to enforce them. At first the people expressed their resentment, in
which, as usual, those of Boston took the lead, by renewing their non-importation
agreements. In the mean time efforts had been made to introduce
domestic manufactures.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> These practical measures in Massachusetts were
supplemented by one of the ablest discussions of colonial rights which had
yet appeared. In the early winter of 1767-8 John Dickinson published in
a Philadelphia newspaper a series of essays entitled <i>The Farmer's Letters</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which soon attracted notice both in America and England.</p>

<p class="pf400">In 1772, when Adams was forty-nine, John
Hancock commissioned Copley to paint pictures

many years in the Hancock mansion on Beacon
Street in Boston, before they were given to the
town. That of Adams is a three-quarters length,

paper, in the attitude of speaking (Perkins's <i>Copley</i>,

some years in Faneuil Hall, it has now been
transferred to the Art Museum. It was engraved&mdash;the
bust only&mdash;by Paul Revere, for the <i>Royal
American Mag.</i>, April, 1774, and a reproduction

this a mezzotint by Samuel Okey was issued at

</div></div>

<p>The year 1768 was one of the most momentous of the Revolutionary
period. Hitherto the colonists, in defence of their property, had denied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the supremacy of Parliament as based on usurpation; but now, in defence
of their privileges, they denied the prerogative of the king, the source of
their political existence. This grew out of the Massachusetts Circular Letter.
The General Court came together December 30, 1767. John Hancock,
James Otis, and Joseph Hawley were prominent members, but though
James Otis was still active, Samuel Adams was the master spirit. Never
was his practical sagacity more serviceable to the cause; never did his genius
for politics shine brighter. His fruitful pen is apparent in the remarkable
series of state papers called forth by the Townshend Acts, comprising
the letter of the House to their London agent (January 12, 1768), the Petition
to the king (January 20), and the Circular Letter to the assemblies of
the several colonies (February 11).<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> If the Townshend Acts were to be
successfully resisted, union of sentiment and action among all the colonies
was essential. This was the object of the circular letter. It was an
arraignment of Parliament and the ministry in respect to the revenue acts,
and the system by which the British government proposed to make civil
officers, including the judges, the instruments for its enforcement; and
it solicited an interchange of opinions on these subjects.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Governor Bernard
watched the proceedings of the House with the deepest interest, nor
was he long in doubt as to the nature of the circular letter, for two days
after its adoption a copy of it was proffered, in case he desired it.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> This
letter was preceded (besides the documents already mentioned) by letters
to the Marquis of Rockingham, General Conway, Lord Camden, and to
the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. The details of these papers
cannot be given here. They present the whole case of the colonies, their
rights, their grievances, their remonstrances, and their petitions. They
proceeded mainly from the pen of Samuel Adams, who, when he had
shaken himself clear from profuse professions of loyalty and disclaimers
of "the most distant thoughts of independence", rose to the annunciation
of the loftiest principles of statesmanship, in the declaration that "the
supreme legislative, in any free country, derives its power from the constitution,
by the fundamental rules of which it is bounded and circumscribed;"&mdash;"that
it is the glory of the British Constitution that it hath
its foundation in the law of God and nature;"&mdash;"that the necessity of
rights and property is the great end of government;"&mdash;"that the colonists
are natural-born subjects by the spirit of the law of nature and
nations;" and "that the laws of God and nature were not made for politicians
to alter." Nor does he confine himself to the enunciation of abstract
principles, but states the rights of the colonists of Massachusetts on historical
grounds, and shows the oppressive and impolitic nature of the acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
complained of.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Changes were taking place in the Grafton ministry which
boded evil to the colonies. Shelburne, the most liberal friend of the Americans,
was succeeded by Hillsborough in December, 1767, and Conway by
Weymouth, January 20, 1768. While the circular letter was on its way
to the colonies and to Westminster (for it was intended also for England),
events were occurring at Boston which showed the temper of the
people, and had no inconsiderable influence upon the action of the British
government. The anniversary of the repeal of the Stamp Act, March 18,
1768, did not pass without popular demonstrations of ill-will to the customs
officials, nor did the governor escape abusive language from the mob.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> For
some years these officers had been resisted in making seizures of uncustomed
goods, which were frequently rescued from their possession by
interested parties, and the determination of the commissioners of customs
to break up this practice frequently led to collisions; but no flagrant outbreak
occurred until the seizure of John Hancock's sloop "Liberty" (June
10, 1768), laden with a cargo of Madeira wine. The officer in charge, refusing
a bribe, was forcibly locked up in the cabin, the greater part of the
cargo was removed, and the remainder entered at the custom-house as the
whole cargo. This led to seizure of the vessel, said to have been the first
made by the commissioners, and for security she was placed under the guns
of the "Romney", a man-of-war in the harbor. For this the revenue
officers were roughly handled by the mob. Their boat was burned, their
houses threatened, and they, with their alarmed families, took refuge on
board the "Romney", and finally in the Castle. These proceedings undoubtedly
led to the sending additional military forces to Boston in September.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The General Court was in session at the time, but no effectual proceedings
were taken against the rioters. Public sympathy was with them in
their purposes, if not in their measures. But the inhabitants of Boston, in
town meeting on the 14th, in an address to Governor Bernard, probably
drawn by Otis,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> among other matters complained of being invaded by an
armed force. With grim humor, the address represents the commissioners,
who had fled for safety to the Castle, as having "of their own notion" relinquished
the exercise of their commission, and expressed the hope that they
would never resume it, and demanded of the governor to give immediate
order for the removal of the "Romney" from the harbor. Some weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
later (June 30) the Council passed the customary resolution, setting forth
"their utter abhorrence and detestation" of the riotous proceedings, and
desiring that the governor, through the attorney-general, would prosecute
all guilty persons, that they and "their abettors might be brought to condign
punishment."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>When the circular letter was laid before the ministry, April 15, 1768,
it caused great excitement in parliamentary circles, and led to the gravest
mistake which was made by the government during the entire Revolutionary
period. Other measures, perhaps without exception, had a show of necessity;
nor, as the British Constitution was then interpreted by the highest
authority, were they clearly unconstitutional. But when the Earl of Hillsborough,
speaking for the king, June 21, 1768, required the Massachusetts
House of Representatives to rescind their circular letter on pain of immediate
dissolution, there was a violation of the constitutional right of the
House to express their opposition to measures deemed injurious to their
constituents, and to communicate their sentiments to other colonies whose
interests were similarly affected. Equally unwise was Hillsborough's letter
to the colonial assemblies, requiring them to disregard the Massachusetts
circular. Responses to the circular letter, when they expressed the sentiments
of the assemblies rather than those of the royal governors, were in full
sympathy with Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The representatives, says Bernard, "have
been much elated, within these three or four days, by some letters they have
received in answer to the circular letter",<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and Hutchinson thought that
"the strength which would be derived from this union confirmed many who
would otherwise have been wavering."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> But when Governor Bernard (June
21, 1768) communicated to the House instructions from the king to rescind
the circular letter, and recommended immediate action as of important consequence
to the province, no doubt it caused anxiety. Under a similar pressure
New York had receded. The House apprehended the gravity of the
situation, and took seven or eight days for consideration, and even then
desired to consult their constituents. But when Bernard informed them
that further delay would be considered as a refusal, they voted, 92 to 17,
not to rescind, and "the number 92", Hutchinson says, "was auspicious,
and 17 of ill omen, for many months after, not only in Massachusetts Bay,
but in most of the colonies on the continent."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> They doubtless were influenced
by Otis, who spoke with great power, and, according to Bernard,
unsparingly denounced the ministry and "passed an encomium on Oliver
Cromwell."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Massachusetts deliberately disobeyed the king's command,
and defied his power. Before dissolution, the House agreed (June 30, 1768)
upon a message to the governor, arguing the question very fully, and declaring
their refusal to rescind; a letter to the Earl of Hillsborough; and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Report and Resolves, in which they repeat the story of their grievances,
doings, and rights with great fullness and ability.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>The effect of this action, so honorable to the House, was unfavorable
upon the ministry. De Berdt, the London agent, in a letter to the House,
August 12, 1768, giving the substance of a conversation with the Earl of
Hillsborough, says that his lordship informed him that he would have used
his influence for the repeal of the Townshend Acts, and believed he could
have obtained it; but since the news respecting the non-rescinding of the
circular letter, the matter was in doubt. "The crown must be supported,
or we sink into a state of anarchy."</p>

<p>In July, 1768, General Gage, then at New York, had been directed by
the ministry to remove one or two regiments to Boston; and when the
news of the riots of March 18 reached England, on August 14, two additional
regiments were ordered from Ireland. When rumors of these
orders became rife in Boston, there were indications that the country would
be raised to prevent the landing of the troops; but different counsels prevailed.
A town meeting was held in Faneuil Hall on the 12th and 13th of
September, which agreed to call a meeting of the towns.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Ninety-six towns
and eight districts were finally represented in the convention which assembled
at the time appointed (September 22). Their first act was a petition to
the governor setting forth their apprehensions in respect to a standing army.
This the governor refused to receive, but he expressed his opinion of the
unauthorized meeting they were holding, directed them to separate instantly,
and threatened to assert the prerogatives of the crown. After a recital of
grievances, with declarations of loyalty and promises of assistance to civil
magistrates in suppressing disorders, they adjourned on the 29th. Their
proceedings were moderate,&mdash;a moderation induced, as some supposed, by
the arrival at Nantasket, September 28, from Halifax of a fleet of seven
armed vessels, with nearly a thousand troops.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> If contempt of the royal
prerogative, after the refusal to rescind the circular letter, could have been
more pointedly expressed, it was by holding a provincial convention without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sanction of law. Between these measures and April 19, 1775, no step
involving a new principle was taken. The burning of the "Gaspee" in
1772 and the destruction of the tea in 1773 were merely the filling in of a
picture firmly sketched in outline.</p>

<p>The refusal of the provincial council and of the town to provide for quartering
the royal troops on their arrival was a practical nullification of the
Mutiny Act, which served still further to strain the relations between Massachusetts
and the British ministry. Parliament came together November
8, 1768. Both Houses were swift to condemn the late proceedings of the
General Court of Massachusetts and of the town of Boston. On December
15 these acts were made the basis of eight resolutions, introduced by the
Earl of Hillsborough, and an address to the king, moved by the Duke of
Bedford, to obtain information respecting the actors in the riotous proceedings
since December 10, 1767, with a view, if deemed advisable, of ordering
their transportation to England for trial. These were passed by the House
of Commons (January 26, 1769), after a debate in which the whole subject
of American affairs was discussed.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The news of these proceedings at first
created some uneasiness in Boston among those implicated; but apprehension
subsided when it was learned from their friends in England that the
voting of Bedford's Address by the two Houses was merely political;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
that lenient, not rigorous, measures were intended by the ministry; and
that the late act laying duties would be repealed. This intelligence reassured
the patriotic party, but correspondingly depressed the tories, who
saw no hope in the vacillating policy of the ministry.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> A policy was much
needed. Chatham had resigned in October, 1768, and the Duke of Grafton
became the nominal, as he had long been the real, head of the ministry.
Lord North, Chancellor of the Exchequer, had charge of the revenue. The
Duke of Grafton favored the total repeal of the Townshend duties, but
Lord North favored the retention of that on tea, as a matter of principle;
and so it was decided by a majority of one in the Cabinet Council. Parliament
rose May 9, and four days later the Earl of Hillsborough reported
to the several colonies the resolutions of the government on the circular
letter. Lord Hillsborough's letter gave little comfort to the Massachusetts
House of Representatives, whose firmness was commended by Pennsylvania
and Virginia, and the threat of transportation of the Bostonians to England
for trial under a statute of Henry VIII. called forth from the latter
colony vigorous resolutions and an address to the king, May 16, 1769.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Jefferson has given the history of these resolutions.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> This action did not
meet the approval of Lord Botetourt, the governor of Virginia, and he dissolved
the House of Burgesses. This, however, did not prevent the delegates
from meeting at the Apollo, in the Raleigh tavern, and, as citizens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
entering into a non-importation agreement which bore the names of Henry,
Randolph, Jefferson, and Washington, and became an example to all the
colonies.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> During the remainder of the year 1769 the progress of the Revolution
was confined chiefly to Massachusetts, and there it assumed the
form of an altercation between the House of Representatives and the governor
in respect to the presence of the king's forces.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Coming in for their
annual session near the end of May, the House, unwilling even to organize
in the presence of the military, sent a message to the governor, remonstrating
against so gross a breach of its privileges, and requesting him to
give orders to remove the standing army, the main guard of which was
kept with cannon pointed at the very door of the State House.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> There was
no design in this arrangement, but it was very menacing, nevertheless.
For nearly two weeks messages kept passing back and forth, to the purport,
on the governor's side, that he had no authority to remove the troops, they
being under the commander-in-chief; and on the part of the House, that
they would do no business while the troops remained. It occurred to the
governor that, if he could not remove the troops, he could remove the
General Court; and this he did by directing the secretary to adjourn it to
Cambridge. The Court did not appreciate this stroke of humor, and proceeded
to business only after a protest of necessity. But Bernard's career
was drawing to a close. June 28th he informed the House that the king
desired him to repair to Great Britain. July 8th the House passed nineteen
resolutions,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> covering the whole ground of dispute with the home government,
and arraigning the governor for various political misdemeanors.
They petitioned for his recall; and Governor Bernard left the province,
accompanied by the reproaches of the House and manifestations of joy by
the people. He did not succeed in a position in which all who had preceded
him and all who followed him failed. He could not serve well two masters.</p>

<p>When Sir Francis Bernard<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> sailed for England on board the "Rippon",
in August, 1769, he left the administration in the hands of Lieutenant-Governor
Hutchinson. For several months nothing of importance took
place, except misunderstandings growing out of the non-observance of the
non-importation agreements (which were renewed March, 1770), and quarrels
between the troops and the populace which resulted in the deplorable
scenes of March 5, 1770. The circumstances which led to this affair are
too well known to need recital in detail. While the town was occupied by
British regiments, collisions were constantly occurring. None knew better
than the populace the helplessness of the soldiers to resent insult or
injury by arms. Even in case of riots, the reading of the Act and the
intervention of the civil power were necessary preliminaries to firing upon
the crowd. Nothing but confinement of the soldiers to their barracks could
have prevented collisions with the populace. The patriot leaders had determined
to get rid of the regiments at all cost. The affair at Gray's wharf
on Saturday, March 2, led to the more serious affray on Monday, the 5th.
On the evening of that day, between seven and eight o'clock, the cry of
fire and ringing of bells drew together a large crowd, which was followed
by a collision with the troops, and resulted in the death of three persons
and wounding of several others, two mortally. The Boston Massacre soon
became known throughout the country, and aroused a spirit of resistance
hitherto unfelt. Its immediate effect was the withdrawal of the troops from
the town to the Castle, on account of the resolute attitude assumed by
Samuel Adams. The men who lost their lives in this affray were buried in
one grave, to which they were followed by an immense procession, and for
some years the anniversary of their death was observed by commemorative
ceremonies. All classes in the community joined in execrating the soldiers,
and gave no ear to justifying or mitigating circumstances. Inflamed
and grossly inaccurate accounts of the transactions were drawn up and
scattered through the colonies and sent to Great Britain. But time somewhat
allayed the first feeling of animosity; and when the facts became
better known, it clearly appeared that the soldiers had fired, without
orders, upon the crowd only when it had become necessary in defence of
their lives. Captain Preston (October 24) and the soldiers (November 27)
engaged in the affray were brought to trial on a charge of murder, and
were all acquitted, except two soldiers who were convicted of manslaughter.
These were slightly branded, and all of them were liberated. John Adams
and Josiah Quincy, Jr., appeared in their defence, and with equal honor
the jurors did their duty in accordance with the law and the evidence.
The news of the events of March 5 became known in London April 21,
through Mr. Robertson. one of the commissioners of the customs.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The Townshend act, though drawn conformably to the colonial distinctions
between internal and external taxes, produced the same dissatisfaction
as the Stamp Act had done. There was no real difference. If Parliament
could lay external taxes, it could lay internal taxes. Non-importation
agreements in the several colonies followed in 1769, and so long as they
were observed, even without great strictness, were disastrous to British
merchants, the value of whose exports to the American colonies between
Christmas in 1767 and Christmas in 1769 fell off nearly £700,000 sterling;
or, if we take the figures for those colonies where the agreement was most
effective, in New England from £419,000 to £207,000, in New York
from £482,000 to £74,000.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Though the agreement was not observed
equally in all the colonies, nor in entire good faith in any,&mdash;Massachusetts
and Rhode Island, particularly, suffered some discredit in this respect, as
compared with New York and Philadelphia,&mdash;the general result seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
alarmed British merchants, who petitioned Parliament for the repeal of the
Townshend act.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> These petitions were considered in the House of Commons
March 5, 1770, and Lord North, in accordance with Earl Hillsborough's
circular letter, proposed to take off all the duties laid by the
Townshend act of 1767, except that on tea, which he would preserve as a
sort of declaratory act, especially since the conduct of the Americans had
been such as to prevent an entire compliance with their wishes.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Governor

<p>Pownall's
amendment was lost by a vote of 204 to 142. The merchants failed
to procure a repeal of the duties, although Alderman Trecothic made one
more effort in their behalf, on the 9th of April, "in a very sensible
speech."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>When the news of the Boston Massacre reached England late in April,
1770, it recalled attention to American affairs, which, after the defeat of
Trecothic's motion, seemed to have been laid aside for the remainder of the
session. Trecothic called for the papers.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> While waiting for them, Governor
Pownall made a speech on the "powers of government [which] the
crown can and ought to grant to the dependencies of the realm; what
form and power of government the British subject in those parts ought
to be governed by; what powers are granted, both civil and military; and
what arrangements, and means taken, for administering and executing these
powers."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Burke, in the second of eight resolutions, affirmed "that a
principal cause of the disorders which have prevailed in North America
hath arisen from the ill-judged and inconsistent instructions given, from
time to time, by persons in administration, to the governors of some of the
provinces of North America."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Later, the same resolutions were brought
forward in the House of Lords by the Duke of Richmond. But Burke was
not acting in good faith. A close observer wrote at the time: "It is plain
enough that these motions were not made for the sake of the colonies, but
merely to serve the purposes of the opposition, to render the ministry, if
possible, more odious, so that they may themselves come into the conduct
of affairs, while it remains very doubtful whether they would do much better,
if at all, than their predecessors."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> This resulted well for the colonies,
and, in the long run, for the progress of liberal ideas in both countries.
But to those who wished for the continuance of the British connection, and
believed in its practicability, it must have been a matter for profound regret
that the liberal leaders, from Chatham to Fox, simply found fault with the
acts of the ministry, and proposed nothing instead. The ministry, conciliatory
to-day and severe to-morrow, had no fixed policy. American affairs
gave way to the exigencies of a general election, just as we have lately seen
in this country, great interests jeopardized by the unwillingness of both
political parties to treat them on the eve of a presidential election. If,
instead of this vacillating and inconsistent policy, both parties had given
their attention to devising some rational system of colonial administration,
as proposed by Pownall,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> leaving local affairs to the colonists, but placing
imperial affairs under a permanent board, not changeable with every ministry,
the colonies and the mother-country might have remained united, perhaps
for a generation, longer.</p>

<p>The Townshend duties, except those on tea, were repealed in April; but
this did not satisfy the colonists, and dissensions arose among the merchants
of the several colonies in regard to the non-importation agreement.
Those of New York became dissatisfied with Boston and Newport merchants,
who had agreed to import non-dutiable articles, even before the
news of the repealing act; and in October, 1770, all sections fell into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
same plan, but no teas were to be imported. The Sons of Liberty in New
York in vain resisted this arrangement.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts the patriots were seldom without causes of just complaint.
Governor Hutchinson, in obedience to instructions of General Gage,
had delivered (September 10) the keys of Castle William, in Boston harbor,
which belonged to the province, to Colonel Dalrymple, who was the
servant of the king; and following royal instructions, had refused to convene
the General Court at Boston, instead of Cambridge, or to assent to
any bill by which the assessors (in 1771) could tax the officers of the
crown.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> These exercises of the royal prerogative, and the payment of the
governor's salary by the crown, involved constitutional questions of higher
import, as the British Constitution then stood, than the question of parliamentary
supremacy, and were matters of unceasing contention. In 1770,
Franklin was chosen London agent of the colony, although not without
some objection, in the place of De Berdt, recently deceased (May), and
Hutchinson was appointed governor in March, 1771.</p>

<p>In 1772, although it was a year of general quiet, two events happened,
which, in different ways, promoted the purposes of the more ardent patriots,&mdash;the
burning of the "Gaspee" at Providence in June, and the formation
of committees of correspondence in November. On the 9th of June, Lieutenant
Dudingston, commander of the "Gaspee", who had shown great
activity in the revenue service at Rhode Island, in undertaking to intercept
the "Providence Packet", Captain Lindsay, ran aground on Namquit Point.
While in this position, the "Gaspee" was boarded on the following night by
a party of citizens led by John Brown, a respectable merchant. In the <i>mêlée</i>
the lieutenant was wounded and the vessel was burned. The affair created
a great sensation in England, and it was ordered that those engaged in it
should be sent to England for trial. For this purpose the home government
appointed colonial commissioners, who sat at Newport from the 4th
to the 22 January, 1773, to inquire into the matter.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> At the end of their
deliberations they required Wanton, the governor of Rhode Island, to arrest
the offenders, for trial in England. He appealed for directions to the Assembly,
as did Stephen Hopkins, the chief-justice of the highest court.
That body referred the matter to the discretion of the chief-justice, and he
accordingly refused to arrest, or to allow the arrest of, any person for transportation.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Nothing came of the order except ill-humor in England and
indignation in the colonies, where it was regarded as an invasion of their
constitutional right of trial by their peers.</p>

<p>Samuel Adams was always busy on political subjects; nor were subjects
wanting. The Earl of Hillsborough had been succeeded in the American
department (August 4, 1772) by Lord Dartmouth; but the change in
administration made no change in the policy of paying the salaries of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
provincial judges by the king, and thus rendering them less dependent on
the popular will. This was thought to be in derogation of colonial rights,
especially so long as the judges held their seats only during the king's
pleasure.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Accordingly, a town meeting assembled in Faneuil Hall, October
28, and adjourned November 2d. Samuel Adams moved "that a
committee of correspondence be appointed, to consist of twenty-one persons,
to state the rights of the colonies, and of this province in particular,
as men, as Christians, and as subjects; to communicate and publish the
same to the several towns in this province and to the world, as the sense
of this town, with the infringements and violations thereof that have been,
or from time to time may be, made; also requesting of each town a free
communication of their sentiments on this subject."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> This was the beginning
of an organization (November 22), entered into with hesitation by
some of the leading patriots of Boston, which finally secured the public
confidence, and became a great power for the concentration of popular sentiment.</p>

<p>It undoubtedly led to the larger measure of intercolonial correspondence
instituted by Virginia during the next spring; and not the least
of its claims to consideration is the fact that it engaged the attention and
secured the services of Joseph Warren as the trusted lieutenant of Samuel
Adams.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The American Revolution rests upon grounds so high and clear, and was
carried forward by measures so honorably conceived and so persistently
adhered to, that all who adopt its principles must regret any circumstance
in its history by which the opinion of candid people is divided. Such a
division is found in connection with the Hutchinson letters. The story
is briefly this:&mdash;In the years 1768 and 1769 Thomas Hutchinson and
Andrew Oliver, then officers in Massachusetts, appointed by the crown, and
sworn to a faithful discharge of their duties, with several other persons, in
a private correspondence with Thomas Whately, an English gentleman,
formerly, but not then, connected with the government, communicated facts
about colonial affairs the truth of which has never been impugned, and
expressed opinions which Tories might honestly entertain. These letters
in some unexplained manner found their way&mdash;either from the cabinet of
the person to whom they were addressed, after his death, or, as is more
likely, from the papers of George Grenville, to whom Whately had probably
entrusted them for perusal&mdash;into the hands of Franklin, the colony
agent in London, by whom they were sent in 1773, with an unsigned letter,
to the speaker of the Massachusetts House. The injunctions in respect
to them were loosely regarded, and they were published by a breach of
faith which implicated a large body of men. They were made the basis
of a petition by the General Court to the king for the removal of their
writers from the offices which they held; but after a hearing before the
Privy Council, January 29, 1774, the petition, which the province did not
attempt to support by evidence, was dismissed as "groundless, vexatious,
and scandalous." Two days later, Dr. Franklin was removed from the office
of deputy postmaster-general for the colonies,&mdash;a circumstance of great
consequence to the American cause, since it irrevocably committed to it
one who had been thought its lukewarm promoter.</p>

<p>Massachusetts, which had led in most of the Revolutionary movements,
did not take the lead in establishing committees of correspondence between
the colonies. That honor belongs to Virginia; and its chief cause was the
action of the commissioners in the "Gaspee" case. March 12, 1773, Dabney
Carr, who had been put forward at the suggestion of Jefferson, moved
certain resolutions in the Virginia House of Burgesses, which, supported
by Richard Henry Lee and Patrick Henry, were unanimously adopted.
Rhode Island followed in adopting similar measures. On May 28th the
Massachusetts House responded to Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Hutchinson justly considers
this as one of the most important and daring movements of the patriotic
Party during the Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> It paved the way for the union of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
colonies and for the General Congress which was convened at Philadelphia
the next year.</p>

<p>To the patriots of Philadelphia belongs the credit of making the first
public demonstration against the project of the East India Company for
transporting their accumulated stock of tea to America, in a series of resolutions
passed October 18, at a meeting held in the State House.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> News
of the intention of the company to do this had reached America in August.
Samuel Adams was ready. The towns in the province of Massachusetts
were aroused by Joseph Warren's circular letter in behalf of the Committee
of Correspondence, September 21, 1773, and the Philadelphia resolutions
were adopted in Faneuil Hall. Constant communications were kept
up between the importing colonies. Ships loaded with tea were dispatched
about the month of August to Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston,
but the tone of the public press in those towns indicated a determination
not to allow the sale of the cargoes. The Charleston consignees, on
the request of the people, resigned; those at Boston refused. November
28, one of the tea ships arrived in Boston, followed not long after by two
more. These were placed under guard by the patriots. The consignees
would neither resign nor return the tea, and the time was near at hand
when they would be seized for non-payment of duties. Thursday, December
16, a large meeting of the citizens was held at the Old South
Church, at which Josiah Quincy, Jr., spoke in words that have become
historical. After all efforts to induce Hutchinson to grant a pass for the
return of the tea (which he thought would be illegal) had proved futile,
a war-whoop was sounded at the door of the Old South, and a large company
of men disguised as Indians rushed to Griffin's wharf. Teas to the
value of £18,000 were thrown from the vessels into the sea, and the same
treatment was bestowed upon another cargo which came some weeks later.
This act, although applauded throughout the colonies, was not imitated by
them; other means were found to prevent the sale of the teas.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>While the news of these events was on its way to England, John Adams
signalized his zeal in the patriotic cause and evinced his faith in the provincial
constitution by leading in the impeachment of Chief-Justice Oliver for
having accepted his salary from the crown instead of the people, in derogation
of their fundamental rights.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Governor Hutchinson, finding himself powerless to quell the storm, determined
to put himself in closer communication with the ministry by
going to England, but was delayed by the death of Lieutenant-Governor
Oliver, until he was finally superseded by General Gage, who arrived in
Boston May 13, 1774. As he was about to leave, he received an address,
dated May 30, approving his conduct, and signed by many respectable
Tories; but some of them were afterwards obliged by threats of popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
violence to make their recantations in the newspapers. June 1, he sailed
from Boston, and never saw his native shore again.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> In the mean time
an account of the destruction of the teas had reached England, and produced
great indignation, which was shared to some extent by the most
ardent friends of the colonists, whose efforts to mitigate and delay the punishment
visited upon the offending people of Boston were unavailing. On
the 7th of March, the king sent a message communicating the despatches
from America; and on the 14th Lord North brought in the Boston Port Bill,
which transferred the commerce of Boston, after the 1st of June, to Salem,
but gave power to the king, in council, to restore it, upon the return of
order and full compensation to the owners for the teas destroyed. Having
passed both Houses, this received the king's assent March 31, and took
effect June 1. While the measure was pending in the House of Lords,
Lord North introduced another bill, which provided for the appointment of
councillors by the crown, the appointment and removal by the governor of
judges of the superior courts, justices of the peace, and other minor officers,
and, with the consent of the council, of sheriffs. The governor's permission
was made necessary for the holding of town meetings, except for the choice
of officers. It was also provided by another act that offenders and witnesses
might be transported for trial to the other colonies, or to England.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>These severe measures did not pass without resistance or protest by
the liberal party in Parliament. They reached Boston June 2, 1774, were
printed in the newspapers on the 3d, and soon found their way into all
the colonies, where they excited indignation against the ministry and sympathy
for the people of Boston, which was manifested by liberal contributions
for relief when afterwards the loss of business had brought distress.
If anything more was needed to arouse the anger of New England, it was
supplied by the Quebec Bill, less objectionable to that section because it
extended the bounds of Canada over regions for which the colonies had
contended, than because it perpetuated civil and ecclesiastical institutions
hateful to the descendants of Puritans. Hutchinson thought that these
severe measures would bring the recalcitrant Bostonians to reason. But
he was mistaken. The matter had already passed from the forum of reason,
and was reserved for the arbitrament of impending war. Instead of
being subdued, the spirit of the people became more resolute.</p>

<p>The Boston Port Bill, designed as a punishment for the destruction of
the tea, brought ruin to the commerce of Boston, and distress to all whose
subsistence depended upon it; but its political effect was to draw the colonies
together, and that was so effectually promoted by the vigorous action
of the committee of correspondence that the idea of a continental congress
soon became general.</p>

<p>On May 26, 1774, Governor Gage informed the General Court that by the
king's command its sessions would be held at Salem from June 1st until
further orders. The court was convened at that place, and the patriots,
guided by Samuel Adams, were making arrangements for a general congress
at Philadelphia, when the governor, getting a hint of their action, sent
Flucker, the provincial secretary, with a message to dissolve them. The
secretary, however, found the door of the chamber of the Representatives
locked; and before it was opened, that body had determined that "a committee
should be appointed to meet, as soon as may be, the committees that
are or shall be appointed by the several colonies on this continent, to consult
together upon the present state of the colonies", and had chosen James
Bowdoin, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Thomas Cushing, and Robert Treat
Paine delegates thereto. Such was the origin in Massachusetts of the first
Continental Congress which met at Philadelphia September 5, 1774.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The 17th of June, the day on which delegates to the Continental Congress
were chosen, is also notable for "the Port Act" meeting in Faneuil Hall.
From the general distress among the laboring classes in Boston the Tories
had expected a reaction in favor of the ministry; consequently a counter
demonstration by the patriots was deemed advisable. In the absence of
Samuel Adams, then at Salem, John Adams was chosen moderator, and
from this time he was one of the most conspicuous actors in the American
Revolution. Joseph Warren was also present, and active in the cause
which, a year later, he consecrated with his blood. The action of the town
became widely known from a broadside, which is here reproduced.</p>

<p>After the repeal of the Stamp Act and the modifying of the Townshend
act, there remained nothing to threaten seriously the pockets of the colonists.
The tea duty had been retained to save the claim of parliamentary
supremacy, which was not likely to be asserted in any offensive way. The
navigation acts must soon have given way to a more liberal and equitable
policy, and everything out of Massachusetts&mdash;certainly out of New England&mdash;indicated
that the people were becoming tired of strife, and were
ready for a return to more cordial relations with the mother country. This
was what Samuel Adams feared, and determined to prevent. To this end
nothing could have been more efficient than his policy in respect to the
teas, and nothing more to his mind than the consequent action of Parliament.
After this a contention which had been mainly local became general.
The essential modification of the Massachusetts charter was a blow
which imperilled every colonial government, and made the cause of Massachusetts
that of every other colony,&mdash;a cause for which other colonies manifested
their sympathy not only in relieving the distress occasioned by the
closing of the port of Boston, but by uniting in declarations of their common
right to maintain the integrity of a system of government which had
been forming through many generations.</p>

<p>The Congress of 1774 was the inevitable result of the conduct of the
British ministry subsequent to the peace of 1763. This served only to
engender discontent in the colonies, and to strengthen the purpose of the
patriotic party to hasten a revolution which many regarded as inevitable in
time. The parliamentary government of the colonies fell into confusion for
want of a well-defined policy and a consistent administration. But instead
of such a policy, colonial affairs were regulated by ministers as wide apart
in their views as Grenville, Rockingham, Townshend, Grafton, Shelburne,
Hillsborough, Lord North, and Earl Dartmouth. Nothing could have kept
the colonies as an integral part of the empire except some plan such as
Franklin or Pownall might have devised and Shelburne might have administered.
But the colonies were remote and but little known, and in the
complication of European affairs, and amid the contentions of parties, they
received only slight and intermittent attention from the ministry or the
Parliament. No statesman save Choiseul seems to have understood the
completeness of the change in interests which had been brought about by
the extinction of the French power in America, or the necessary advance
of the colonies under a new régime to a place among the great powers of
the world. The colonists themselves felt, rather than understood, their
relations to nationality and to the commerce of the world. This was the
time chosen by the British ministry to impose upon them the restrictive
mercantile system of Charles II.</p>

There are other significant broadsides of about
this time. On June 8th, the citizens of Boston
issued an address to their countrymen relative
to the blockade of their port, and on July 26th
they adopted a letter on the blockade, which
was sent to the several towns,&mdash;both in broadside.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>It is doubtful, however, whether any policy could have rendered permanent
the subjection of the colonies, even such a nominal subjection as that
in which they had always been held. In looking for the causes of the Revolution,
it is well to discriminate between those which were general in their
effects and those which were local. The latter had been more actively operative
and of longer existence in Massachusetts, where the Revolution began,
than in any other colony. These were interwoven with the civil and ecclesiastical
history of her people, which made them peculiarly apprehensive
in respect to threatened invasion of rights which they had secured only by
expatriation. Although the peculiar experience of Massachusetts did not
cause the Revolution, it is doubtful whether, except for that experience, the
Revolution would have occurred for some years. Nor was resistance to the
Anglican ecclesiastical pretensions, connected as they were with the most
odious features of the prerogative, confined to New England, but made
itself felt in New York and in Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The general causes were the
ever present and ever active strife between parties,&mdash;the liberals and the
conservatives,&mdash;arising from a diversity of political ideas, and intensified
by ambition, interest, and personal animosities. But the proximate causes
of the Revolution will be found in that change of policy which led the
ministry, at the close of a war that had strained the colonies to the utmost,
to enforce the navigation laws, to lay taxes, to invoke the prerogative,
and finally to overthrow the government of Massachusetts, and thus
to threaten the autonomy of the people under the provincial constitutions.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid"><a name="c62" id="c62">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE change in British colonial policy contemplated by the ministry during the progress
of the French War, and entered upon between 1763 and 1774, developed those
causes of dissatisfaction which had been intermittently operative for more than a century,
and finally led to war in 1775. In the preceding chapter I have omitted, or passed
lightly over, many incidents of the period which had no particular political significance,
and dwelt more at length on the principles and causes which led to the Revolution. I
shall pursue the same course in this essay.</p>

<p>The growth and development of the colonies brought forward, in succession, two practical
questions. The first was, how far the interests of the colonies, as appendages to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
crown, but subject, nevertheless, to an undefined parliamentary authority, could be subordinated
to the interests of the trading and manufacturing classes in England. This was
purely an economic question, and the answer to it in England assumed the subjection of
the colonies and the validity of the mercantile system, neither of which was vigorously
contested by the colonists so long as neither was rigidly enforced. But the question
changed during the progress, and more especially at the close, of the French War, and
then became this: How far could the interests of the colonies be subordinated to the
necessities of an imperial revenue and the political policy of an empire? Hence arose
the second question: What degree of autonomy could be allowed to the colonies, as integral
parts of the empire, entitled to its privileges and subject to its burdens, when both
were to be determined consistently with the constitutional prerogatives of the king and
the supremacy of Parliament on the one side, and on the other with the natural and
acquired rights of the colonies?</p>

<p>Regarded purely as an economic question, it was a matter of indifference to the colonists
whether their pockets were depleted by the enforcement of an old policy or by the
adoption of a new policy. The Sugar Act of 1733, if enforced, would have produced a
parliamentary tax. The Grenville Act of 1764 did no more. But the former was intended
as a regulation of trade; the latter to produce a revenue. This difference of intent raised
a constitutional question, and it was on this constitutional question, behind which lay the
real economic question, that the patriotic party chose to fight the battle. Grenville's Act,
as an external tax, produced but little; and the Stamp Act, as an internal tax, not a farthing.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, mainly on the constitutional question&mdash;of the right to tax, rather
than to throw off intolerable burdens&mdash;that people divided into parties. As Webster
said, "They went to war against a preamble. They fought seven years against a declaration."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
To understand the attitude of the tories on the economic question as well as on
the constitutional question, we must consider the state of colonial affairs which led to the
Congress of 1754, and the tentative efforts of that body to find consistent and reciprocal
relations of the colonies to the imperial government, for union, defence, and revenue. To
understand the attitude of the patriots, we must consider the reasons of the ministry for
rejecting such a union, and their efforts to force each colony into relations to the crown
and Parliament deemed by them consistent and reciprocal, but regarded by the colonists
as subversive of their rights as Englishmen, and of their rights acquired by charters,
growth, development, and usage, which, as they justly claimed, had become constitutional.</p>

<p>Though the enforcement of the navigation laws and acts of trade, at the close of the
French War, is regarded by historians as one of the principal causes of the Revolution, I
fail to find a satisfactory or entirely accurate account of them, either as the basis of the
mercantile system, or, later, of a revenue system. Such a treatment would hardly be practicable
in the limits of a general history. These laws have been elaborately discussed by
Thomas Mun, Sir Josiah Child, Sir William Patty, Charles Davenant, Joshua Gee, John
Ashley, and, not to mention others, Adam Smith and Henry Brougham. But these authors
wrote with reference to their influence, as part of the mercantile system, on British interests.
How they affected colonial interests is the question which chiefly concerns us.</p>

<p>To answer this question we must know not merely what those laws enacted, but to
what state of colonial trade they originally and successively applied. For instance, what,
from time to time, by development of agricultural or other industries, between 1640 and
1774, had the colonists to sell, and what, as they increased in wealth, did they wish to
purchase; and where, left to the unrestricted course of trade, would they have carried
their products, and where purchased their merchandise? In other words, what would
they have done and become under free trade?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we must know what changes in this normal condition of trade were intended by
the navigation laws, and to what extent and with what effect their partial enforcement
operated before 1763. With these facts before us, we could estimate with some exactness
the valid objections to the new system on the part of the colonists, when enforced
by the British navy, commissioners of customs, admiralty courts, and writs of assistance,
and what was their influence in bringing on the Revolution.</p>

<p>Having made up the debit account, we should be able to set against it the compensations
in naval protection, bounties,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> drawbacks, British capital, and long credits, in developing
colonial agriculture and commerce.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately there does not exist any history of the commerce of the American colonies,
from the Commonwealth to 1774, as affected by navigation laws, acts of trade, and
revenue measures. No one who has read the twenty-nine acts which comprise this legislation
will recommend their perusal to another; for, apart from their volume, the construction
of these acts is difficult,&mdash;difficult even to trained lawyers like John Adams,
whose business it was to advise clients in respect to them.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Nor have special students,
like Bancroft, stated their effect with exact precision, as in respect to the Act of 1663;<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
and notably in respect to the Townshend Act of 1767,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> where his error amounts to a perversion
of its meaning. Palfrey has been more successful, though not entirely free from
error.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The author of the <i>Development of Constitutional Liberty</i>,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> a work of uncommon
research and ability, reads the act of 1672 as though it prohibited the carrying of fish from
Massachusetts to Rhode Island except by the way of England, failing to notice that it
was not one of the "enumerated articles", or that even those could pass directly from
colony to colony upon payment, at the place of export, of duties equivalent to those laid
upon their importation to England. To give a monographic treatment to the subject would
require familiarity with the construction of statutes, and exact information not only of the
shifting conditions of colonial trade, but of the evasions which called forth supplemental
acts, or constructions of existing acts by the Board of Trade.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>In Burke's <i>Account of the European Settlements in America</i><a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> much may be found
respecting colonial products and commerce, and especially those of New England (in ch.
vii.), which leaves little to be desired concerning the sources of her wealth, and the complaints
of British merchants of the methods by which it had been acquired. But I have
found nowhere else so full and clear an account of the course of trade of Boston at the
time of the Revolution, and the effect upon it of the enforcement of the navigation laws
and acts of trade in 1770, as in an anonymous pamphlet entitled <i>Observations of the Merchants
at Boston in N. E. upon Several Acts of Parliament, 1770</i>.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>An essential part of this history is that which relates to the medium of exchange, and
to the attempts of Parliament to regulate the issue of paper money as a legal tender in
the interests of British merchants.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The history of the navigation laws suggests the similarity of the causes which led to the
successive revolutions of 1689 and 1775 in Massachusetts. The violation of these laws
was a principal reason for the abrogation of the first charter, in 1684, graphically described
by Palfrey,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and their enforcement by courts of admiralty, under Dudley, Andros, and Randolph,
was one cause of the overthrow of the Andros government in 1689.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The resistance
to the same and additional enactments, when enforced as revenue measures, led to
the alteration of the second charter in 1774, and this again led to revolution by the united
colonies.</p>

<p>One of the most efficient instruments in the execution of the navigation laws was the
writs of assistance granted by the court in Massachusetts in 1761.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>If the student of American history finds difficulty in accepting the common accounts of
the constitutional opinions and motives of two fifths of the colonists, among whom were
many who must be regarded as intelligent and respectable, his doubts as to the accuracy
of these narratives receive some confirmation when he becomes familiar with the history
of the Congress of 1754, the circumstances which led to it, and the opinions of some of
its representative men. A comparison of their views will show how far they were willing
to go in the "abridgment of English liberties", for the sake of union, defence, and government.
Franklin, Hutchinson, and Pownall formed plans for union, and all were at Albany
in 1754, and participated in the discussions, though Pownall, not being a member, explained
his views outside the congress.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The difference between Pownall, Hutchinson, and Franklin was this: that while all contemplated
the union of the empire under one general government as something dictated
by the interest of all the parts, Hutchinson limited the power of the President more than
Franklin, and Pownall was unwilling to contemplate the transfer of its seat to America;
the prospect of which gave Franklin no concern. "The government cannot be long
retained without union. Which is best, to have a total separation, or a change of the seat
of government?"<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Speculations as to the results of such a union are now idle, unless for
the interest drawn towards them by Professor Seeley's <i>Expansion of England</i>, and
Franklin's belief, expressed in 1789, "that if the foregoing plan [that of 1754], or something
like it, had been adopted and carried into execution, the subsequent separation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the colonies from the mother country might not so soon have happened, nor the mischiefs
suffered on both sides have occurred, perhaps, during another century."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>A comparison of the views of such men as Franklin, Hutchinson, and Pownall, expressed
before they were forced into partisan relations to the impending conflict, help us in forming
opinions respecting their conduct when affairs, no longer within the control of individuals,
were swept onward by an uncontrollable impulse. Neither the colonies<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> nor the
ministry approved of the proposed union; and when the new policy of raising a revenue
was inaugurated the colonies were without defined integral relations to the mother country,
and the government without administrative machinery for their regulation. The result
was confusion. The press became heated, and an angry war of pamphlets ensued. At first
the controversy was confined to the distinction between internal taxes and commercial regulations,
but soon it involved the whole question of parliamentary power. This was elaborately
and temperately discussed in the <i>Farmer's Letters</i>, by John Dickinson, but nowhere
in America with more fulness (within the period covered by this chapter) than by Governor
Hutchinson and the two Houses of the Massachusetts General Court, in messages
and answers respectively, in January and February, 1773.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>So far as the Revolution grew out of the Massachusetts controversy between the king's
representatives and the General Court, its progress may be traced in the <i>Speeches of the
Governors of Massachusetts, 1765 to 1775, and the Answers of the House of Representatives
to the same</i>.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> These authentic documents, with the <i>Journals of the House</i> and the
<i>Records of the Town of Boston</i>, may be referred to as showing the temper with which the
parties treated each other, and the questions that were of paramount interest. The student
will not find it easy to ascertain the facts which should make the history of the period.
Contemporaneous accounts were generally drawn up with a partisan disregard of truth,
and too much has been written subsequently in the same spirit. For the critical period
of 1768, when the troops were sent over on account of the revenue riots, we have Bernard's
<i>Letters</i>, which, though representing only one side, were written under a sense of
official responsibility to the government. Though much complained of at the time as
wanting in candor, their statements were evaded rather than controverted by the <i>Answer
of the Major Part of the Council</i>, in a letter to the Earl of Hillsborough (April 15, 1769), as
well as in <i>The Vindication of the Town of Boston</i> (Oct. 18, 1769), drafted by Samuel Adams.
For the entire period covered by this chapter, I find no narrative apparently more just, or
opinions more candidly expressed, than in Ramsay's <i>History of the American Revolution</i>.
Remote from the scene of the conflict, Ramsay shared the passions of neither party.</p>

<p>The most important events of this period were the passage of the Boston Port Bill, and
other related measures. The reasons which led to these acts are set forth at length in
<i>The Report from the Committee on the Disturbances in the Colony of Massachusetts Bay</i>,
April 20, 1774.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In this report may be seen the strength of the British case. Franklin's
view of the matters referred to in the Report of the Lords may be found in a paper entitled
<i>Proceedings in Massachusetts</i>,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and the bill itself was discussed in an interesting
pamphlet by Josiah Quincy, Jr., <i>Observations on the Act of Parliament</i>.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Franklin's paper was a clever argument in which he treated facts so as to serve his purpose
rather than that of historic truth. His use of Oliver's phrase, "to take off the original
incendiaries", which was a pleasant <i>ad hominem</i> hit, has been adopted seriously by
Bancroft,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> in a chapter entitled "A Way to Take off the Incendiaries." The concessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
which Franklin was willing to make for a settlement of the difficulties, as late as December
4, 1774, may be seen in "Some Special Transactions of Dr. Franklin in London, in
Behalf of America", in Ramsay.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

is by Blackburn, painted in 1755, and now owned by Mrs. H. B. Rogers. The earliest engraving of it which
I have noticed is by A. B. Durand in Tudor, and again in the <i>Worcester Magazine</i> (1826), vol. i. It has been
engraved by W. O. Jackman, J. R. Smith, O. Pelton, and best of all by C. Schlecht, in Gay's <i>Pop. Hist.
U. S.</i>, iii. 332. Cf. Loring's <i>Hundred Boston Orators</i>, and the woodcut in the <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 6.
The earliest engraved likeness is probably a rude cut on the title of Bickerstaff's <i>Almanac</i> (1770), which
is reproduced in Lossing's <i>Field-Book of the Rev.</i>, i. 486.</p>

<p class="pf400">There is a photograph of the house where Otis was killed by lightning (May 28, 1783) in Bailey's <i>Andover</i>,
p. 86. Cf. <i>Appleton's Journal</i>, xi. 784. The principal detailed authority on the career of Otis (born, 1724;
died, 1783) is William Tudor's <i>Life of James Otis</i>, which Lecky, in his <i>England in the Eighteenth Century</i>
(iii. 304), calls "a remarkable book from which I have derived much assistance." Francis Bowen wrote the
life in Sparks's <i>Amer. Biog.</i>, vol. xii. John Adams had an exalted opinion of Otis, and Otis's character
receives various touches in Adams's <i>Works</i> (x. 264, 271, 275, 279, 280, 284, 289-295, 299, 300). Bancroft
depicts him in 1768 (vol. vi. 120, orig. ed.), but he failed rapidly later by reason of the blows he received in an
assault in Sept., 1769, provoked by him. Cf. Greene's <i>Hist. View</i> (p. 322); D. A. Goddard in <i>Mem. Hist.

<p>The issue on the question of taxation without
representation was forced, after many indications
of its coming,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> when the British Parliament
passed the Grenville Act in 1764, and in the
next year what is known as the Stamp Act, a tax
on business papers, increasing their cost at different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
rates, but sometimes manyfold.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The
question of the authorship of the bill is one
about which there has been some controversy,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
and, contrary to the general impression, the
truth seems to be that the consideration of the
bill caused little attention in and out of Parliament,
and the debates on it were languid.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>In May a knowledge of the passage of the
Stamp Act reached Boston,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and it was to go
into effect Nov. 1st. In June the Massachusetts
legislature determined to invite a congress of all
the colonies in October. In August it was
known that Jared Ingersoll for Connecticut and
Andrew Oliver for Boston had agreed to become
distributors of the stamps. The mob
hanged an effigy of Oliver on the tree afterwards
known as Liberty Tree,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> and other outrages followed.
The governor did not dare to leave the
castle. Dr. Mayhew delivered a sermon, vigorous
and perhaps incendiary, as Hutchinson
averred when he traced to it the passions of the
mob which destroyed his own house in North
Square on the evening of August 26th.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The

<p>Franklin had, with considerable opposition,
been appointed the London agent of Pennsylvania
in 1764, and, being in that city, was accused
by James Biddle of promoting the passage of
the Stamp Act, but his letters show how he
seems only to have yielded when he could not

<p>In July, 1765, the Rockingham administration
came in, followed by the parliamentary sparring
of Grenville and Pitt. In February, 1766, Dr.
Franklin was examined before the House of
Commons as to the temper of the colonies respecting
the Stamp Act. He gave them some
good advice,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and a full report of the questions

passed the so-called Declaratory Act (March
7th) in vindication of its prerogatives, Pitt and

<p>Josiah Tucker, the Dean of Gloucester, began
in 1766 a series of tracts, which he continued for
ten years, in which he advanced sentiments respecting
the colonies, not very flattering, while
at the same time he held to arguments which
few at the time admitted the force of, when he
advocated the peaceful separation of America
from the crown.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Some other fac-similes are also given indicative
of the prevailing coercive measures, which soon
became popular. The next year (1768) committees
were appointed in New York to consider
the expediency of entering into measures to encourage
industry and frugality and to employ
the poor, and by 1769 the movement looking to
independence of the British manufacturers became
general through the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>What is known as the "War of the Regulators",
or "Regulation", a series of riotous disturbances
in North Carolina, 1768-1771, has
usually been held to be one of the preliminary
uprisings against British oppression. A. W.
Waddell, in a paper in the <i>N. E. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg.</i> (1871, p. 81), contends that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
nothing but a lawless outburst, and advances
evidence to prove that the participants were but
a small majority of the people, with no great
principle in view; that they were ignorant, never
republicans, became Tories, and were opposed
by the prominent Whig leaders. He considers
that Caruthers and other local historians<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> are responsible
for the common misconception arising
from their attempt to reflect credit on North
Carolina for what is claimed to be an early patriotic
fervor.</p>

<p class="pf400">In Sept. (dated 14th) the selectmen of Boston sent a circular to the other towns, calling a convention (<i>Boston

be expected in this province" (original broadside in Mass. Hist. Soc., <i>Misc. MSS.</i>, 1632-1795). It is printed
and explained in that society's <i>Proceedings</i>, iv. 387. The convention sat from Sept. 22d to 29th. On the 30th,
in the early morning, the British fleet took soundings along the water-front, and in the afternoon a number of
war-ships came up from the lower harbor and anchored with springs on their cables. On Oct. 1st the landing
took place. The news spread through the land, and the irritation was increased. (Cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc.

<p class="pf400">The question of the expense of quartering troops had been raised by Massachusetts and New York in
1767 (Hutchinson, iii. 168), and a letter of Gage on the subject is in the Shelburne Papers, vol. li. (<i>Hist. MSS.
Com. Rept.</i>, v. 219). Cf. Hillsborough to Governor Franklin in <i>N. J. Archives</i>, x. p. 12. The message of the

<p>The most important development in 1769
came from some letters which had been addressed
by Governor Bernard and General Gage
to the ministry, and to which, in the exercise of
his rights as a member of Parliament, Alderman
Beckford had obtained access and taken copies,
subsequently delivered by him to Bollan, who
transmitted them to Boston, where they were at
once printed. From these letters the public
learned of the urgency which the governor had
used with the government to induce it to institute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
more stringent measures of repression.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>The publication of these letters led to the
printing of <i>An appeal to the world; or a vindication
of the town of Boston, from many false and
malicious aspersions contain'd in certain letters
and memorials, written by Governor Bernard,

<p>There are in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (no. xx.) copies
of annotations which Franklin, then in London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
made on the margins and fly-leaves of sundry
pamphlets, which just at this time were engaging
attention in London, and these comments show
how the struggle was regarded by a mind of
Franklin's astuteness, amid the influences of the
British capital. Sparks printed parts of these
annotations in his <i>Familiar letters and miscellaneous

<p>The Boston Massacre of March, 1770, was the
violent culmination of prevailing passions, and
was in a measure induced by the sacrifice of life
which resulted from the boarding by a press-gang

Hooper, of Marblehead,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> and by the riotous proceedings

being sung at Liberty Hall and the Greyhound Tavern in Aug., 1768. It had been reprinted in the <i>Boston

<p>The principal statement on the government
side was <i>A Fair Account of the late unhappy disturbance
at Boston, extracted from the depositions
that have been made concerning it by persons of
all parties, with an appendix containing affidavits
and evidences not mentioned in the narrative that

This <i>Fair Account</i> contained a deposition of Secretary
Andrew Oliver, tending to show that the
soldiers were justifiably defending themselves;
and making public the doings of the governor's
council thereupon. This "breach of a most essential
privilege" excited animadversion, and
the council censured Oliver.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The purport of
the English presentations is to show that the soldiers
did not fire till duly provoked by assaults,

<p>Bancroft (orig. ed., vi. 347) has a long note on
the evidence about the provocation and first assault.
He gives ten reasons for thinking Preston
gave orders to fire, and six reasons for thinking
the provocation was not sufficient to justify
the firing. The evidence in this form is omitted
in the final revision of Bancroft.</p>

<p>The year 1771 was less eventful. In England,
it seemed for a while as if the worst had
passed. W. S. Johnson had written at the close
of the preceding year (Dec. 29, 1770), "The general
American controversy is at present looked
upon here as very much at an end."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Franklin

<p>There are diverse views as to the originator
of the committees of correspondence. Gordon's
opinion (i. 312) that James Warren was the instigator
was adopted by Marshall, but is held
by Bancroft (vi. 428) to be erroneous. John Adams
gave the first movement to Samuel Adams.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
One of the first-fruits of the committee, as a
provincial measure, was the report drafted by
Samuel Adams (Nov. 2, 1772), which was printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
as the <i>Rights of the Colonies</i>.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The vote passed

<p>The seizure and destruction of the revenue
vessel Gaspee in Narragansett Bay, June 10,
1772, is considered by Rhode Island writers as
the earliest aggressive conduct of the patriots.
John Russell Bartlett,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> in the <i>R. I. Colonial Records</i>
(vol. vii. pp. 57-192), gathers all the documentary
evidence, and this was in 1861 published
separately as <i>A History of the Destruction
of his Britannic Majesty's Schooner Gaspee ...
accompanied by the Correspondence connected therewith;
the action of the General Assembly of Rhode
Island thereon, and the official journal of the ...
Commission of Inquiry appointed by King George
III.</i><a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>Early in 1773 the patriots of Boston produced
what is called "the most elaborate state paper
of the Revolutionary contest in Massachusetts."
This is the reply of the House of Representatives
to the governor in the contest then waging
with him.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>The act which included the duty on tea had
passed Parliament June 29, 1767, and in March,
1770, it had been repealed, except, in order to
maintain the theoretical right of Parliament to
tax, the tax on tea had been retained in force.
Pownall<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> had exerted his utmost to make the
repeal include tea. The test was deferred till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
it was announced<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> that the East India Company
was assisted by government in sending
over a surplus of tea which they had. A series
of impassioned gatherings in Boston, and demonstrations
not so boisterous in the other colonies,
led to the destruction of the tea in Boston
harbor, and elsewhere resulted in the transshipment
of the tea whence it came.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>Another significant event of 1773 was the episode
of the Hutchinson letters. They had been
written (1767-1769), from Boston, to Thomas
Whately, and came, after the latter's death
(June, 1772), by some unknown means, into
Franklin's hands. When Cushing<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> and the patriots
printed them,&mdash;for the rumor of their existence
led the "people abroad" to compel their
publication,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>&mdash;Franklin made no complaint, and
bore with reserve the defamation which was visited
upon him in England, and which is still repeated
by later English writers,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Franklin finally
prepared a statement in vindication, but it was
not published till Temple Franklin printed his
edition of <i>Franklin's Works</i>.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The letters were
printed without any indication of Franklin's
connection with them; but when a duel grew
out of the publication, in which a brother of
Whately was wounded by Mr. Temple,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> who
had been accused of purloining the letters, Dr.
Franklin, to prevent a further meeting, published
a note in the <i>Public Advertiser</i>, acknowledging
his agency.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Sparks appends a note in
his edition,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> in which he refutes the claim of
Dr. Hosack (<i>Biographical Memoir of Dr. Hugh
Williamson</i>, 1820) that Williamson had been the
medium of transmitting the letters.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Mr. R. C. Winthrop, in discussing the question,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
introduces a paper of George Bancroft,
"Whence came the papers sent by Franklin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Cushing in his letter of Dec. 2, 1772?" Bancroft's
conclusion is that Whately sent the letters
to Grenville (who died Nov. 13, 1770), and
they were found among his papers, and through
some agency or consent of Temple passed into
Franklin's hand.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>The earliest significant movement in 1774 was
the impeachment of Peter Oliver, chief justice,
and younger brother of the late lieutenant-governor,
for receiving his salary from the crown,&mdash;the
controversy respecting the governor and
other officers being thus made independent of
the people, having been one which had been

<p>Gen. Gage had landed in Boston May 17th,
to put in force, June 1st, what is known as the
Boston Port Bill (approved March 31, 1774), or
<i>An Act to discontinue, in such manner, and for
such time as are therein mentioned, the landing
and discharging, lading or shipping, of goods,
wares, and merchandise, at the town, and within
the harbour of Boston, in the province of Massachuset's
Bay, in North America</i>.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>While Salem and Marblehead were thus made
chief ports of entry, the commerce of Boston was
suddenly checked, and the town was forced to
a dependence for succor upon other towns and
other colonies.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

was instant and widespread.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>One of the immediate results in Massachusetts
because of these oppressive acts was a retaliatory
"Solemn League and Covenant" agreed
upon in the provincial assembly,&mdash;a combination
made more or less effectual by the active
agency of Boston and Worcester in issuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
broadsides against the use of imported British
goods.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>In July, 1774, close upon his arrival in London,
Hutchinson held an interview with the
king, and set forth his opinions of the condition
of affairs in the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>It is claimed by Dawson<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> that the movements
of 1774 in New York Were precipitated
by the merchants and their adherents, "aristocratic
smugglers", who formally organized themselves
in May, 1774; and it was on the 6th of

<p>The question of originating the Congress of

<p>The Congress opened with a concession of

something of the appearance and bearing of an
assembly, where the "Tories were neither few
nor feeble", and the political feelings were far
from being in unison. "One third Whigs, another
Tories, the rest mongrel", he says.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Franklin

and Christopher Marshall's diary.</p>

<p>The original edition of the <i>Journal of the Proceedings
of the Congress held in Philadelphia, Sept.
5, 1774</i> (Philad., 1774), bore the earliest device
of the colonies, twelve hands grasping a column

<p>The Congress put forth a Declaration of
Rights, and a draft of it is preserved in a hand
thought to be that of Major Sullivan, of New
Hampshire. Wells (<i>Sam. Adams</i>, ii. 234) thinks
that Samuel Adams had a hand in it, as it resembles
the pamphlet issued by the Boston Committee
of Correspondence in 1772. The original
draft of it, with the final form, is given in the
<i>Works of John Adams</i>,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> who claimed the authorship

drafted by John Dickinson.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> It was signed in

<p>The petition to the king was first printed in
London by Becket in <i>Authentic Papers from
America, submitted to the dispassionate consideration
of the public</i> (London, 1775). This produced
a card (Jan. 17, 1775) from Bollan, Franklin,
and Arthur Lee, calling the copy of the petition
"surreptitious as well as materially and
grossly erroneous" (<i>Sparks Catal.</i>, p. 84).</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that R. H. Lee, and
sometimes that John Jay, wrote the "Address
to the People of Great Britain" which the Congress
adopted.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> They also passed a "Memorial

<p>On the 9th of September the people of Boston
and the neighborhood met outside the limits
of the town, and passed a paper, drawn up
by Joseph Warren, more extreme and less dignified
than was demanded, known as the "Suffolk
Resolves",<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> and this was transmitted to
the Congress, where, when the Resolves were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
read, as John Adams says, there were tears in
the Quaker eyes. Jones<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> says that the loyalists
had joined the Congress to help in claiming
redress for grievances, but that the approval
of these Resolves rendered their continuance
with the Congress in its measures impossible.
Hutchinson<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> says that when the Resolves were
known in England, they were more alarming
than anything which had yet been done.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>On Sept. 28th Joseph Galloway introduced
his plan of adjustment, calling for a grand council
to act in conjunction with Parliament in regulating
the affairs of the colonies. The scheme
was finally rejected by a vote of six colonies to
five, after having allured many of the leading
men to its support.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>The Congress, Oct. 20th, adopted the Articles
of Association, pledging in due time the
country to non-importation, non-exportation, and
non-consumption, so as to sever completely all
commercial relations with England.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>In the summer of 1774 the British Parliament
had, after some opposition, passed what is
known as the "Quebec Bill", restoring the old
French law in the civil courts of Quebec, securing
rights to the Catholic inhabitants, and
extending the limits of that province south
of Lake Erie as far as the Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

          <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">JOSIAH QUINCY'S DIARY.</p>
          <p class="pf400">This is reproduced from a page of the diary of Josiah Quincy, Jr., which was kept while he was in London
in 1774. It is the beginning of his description of an interview with Lord North. The original diary is
among the Quincy MSS. in the cabinet of the Mass. Hist. Society. Quincy had sailed from Salem Sept. 28,
1774, and was not averse to having the Tories think that he was going for his health; but Gage seemed to
have had a suspicion that about this time somebody was going over with bad designs (P. O. Hutchinson, 296).
We learn from the same source (p. 301) that North thought his interviewer was "a bad, insidious man, designing
to be artful without abilities to conceal his design",&mdash;a view that Hutchinson no doubt had helped the
minister to form. With Quincy's spirit, we can imagine how North's warning that there must be submission
before reconciliation would be taken. There was some suspicion also that Quincy was making observations
upon Franklin to discern how far that busy genius could be trusted. Franklin seems to have satisfied him,
and on his homeward voyage Quincy dictated to a sailor the report to the patriots that he had every reason to
fear he would not live to deliver in person, as indeed he did not. It is preserved, and printed in his <i>Life</i>, where
will be found his journal kept in London. Joseph Reed's letters to him, while in London, are in <i>The Life of
Joseph Reed</i>, i. 85, etc. Quincy made out lists in London of the friends and foes of America among the merchants.

<p>Another leading Tory writer at this time was
Dr. Myles Cooper, the president of King's College,
who was as sharply assailed for his <i>Friendly
Address</i><a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> as the "Westchester Farmer" was.</p>

<i>A true state of the proceedings in the Parliament
of Great Britain, and in ... Massachusetts Bay,
relative to the giving and granting the money of
the people of that province, and of all America, in
the House of Commons, in which they are not represented</i>
(London, 1774), for Franklin is said to
have furnished the material for it, and Arthur
Lee to have drafted it.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>The Assembly of New York met in January,

head in <i>Gentleman's Mag.</i>, March, 1770.</p>

<p class="pf300">In 1768, Edmund Jennings of Virginia, being in London, and seeking, probably unsuccessfully, to get a portrait
of Camden for some "gentlemen of Westmoreland County" who had subscribed for that purpose, contented
himself with commissioning young "Peele, of Maryland", then in London, to make a picture of Chatham,
following "an admirable bust by Wilton, much like him, though different from the common prints." Jennings
presented it to R. H. Lee in a letter dated Nov. 15, 1768, and the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> of April 20, 1769,
says it had just arrived. The picture was placed in Stratford Hall, Lee's house, but was transferred to the
Court-House of Westmoreland in 1825, or thereabouts. In 1847 it was transferred to the State of Virginia, and
placed in the chamber of the House of Delegates in Richmond, where it now is. It represents Chatham "in
consular habit, speaking in defence of American liberty." Cf. <i>Va. Hist. Reg.</i>, i. p. 68; <i>Richmond Despatch</i>,
Sept. 26, 1886. There is an engraving of Hoare's portrait of Chatham, representing him sitting and holding
a paper, given in fac-simile in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Feb., 1887. On the statue of Pitt at Charleston, S. C.,
see <i>Mag. of Amer. History</i>, viii. 214. For medals, see account by W. S. Appleton in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,

<p class="pc1 mid">THE CONFLICT PRECIPITATED.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY JUSTIN WINSOR,</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>The Editor</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">"YOU must be firm, resolute, and cautious; but discover no marks of
timidity", wrote one from London to James Bowdoin, February 20,
1774.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Firm, resolute, cautious, but bold! This was the impelling spirit
of the hour. Hutchinson was at the same time writing to Dartmouth that
anarchy was likely to increase, till point after point was carried, and every
tie of allegiance was severed.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Indications were increasing that the conflict
of argument and the burst of political passion were before long to give
way to the trial of force, and to the inevitable severing of friends which a
resort to arms would entail. All this was prefigured on the first of June,
1774, when Hutchinson, bearing with him the addresses of his admirers,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
left his house on Milton Hill forever, and walked along the road, bidding
his neighbors good-bye at their gates; when, as he approached Dorchester
Neck, he got into his carriage, which had followed him, and was driven to
the point, where he took boat, was conveyed to a frigate, and in a short
time was passing out by Boston light, leaving behind the line of ships at
their moorings, which, with shotted guns, marked the beginning of the
Boston blockade. That severing of friends and that threat of war was at
that moment, away off in Virginia, accompanied by the tolling of bells out
of sympathy for Boston. The Massachusetts yeomanry had not yet openly
seized the musket, but their tribune, Sam. Adams, a few days later, turned
the key upon the governor's secretary in Salem, when that officer was sent
to dissolve the assembly. It was then that Adams and his associates proceeded
to pass votes, with no intention of submitting them to the executive
approval,&mdash;the beginning of the end, which we have seen Hutchinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
but a few months before had anticipated. Between the upper and the
nether mill-stone, between the patriots of Massachusetts and the Tories of
Parliament, the charter of William and Mary was rapidly crushed. Parliament
determined that all power should come from them, and the province
leaders determined otherwise. So the distribution of authority provided
under the charter ceased. The rival powers in and around Boston could
not long abstain from force. Each watched the other, in the hopes of a
pretext to be beforehand, without being the aggressor.</p>

<p>On the first of July, 1774, when Hutchinson, in London, was convincing
the king that the ministry's aggressive measure was going to bring the recalcitrant
Bostonians to terms,
Admiral Graves, in his flag-ship,
was entering Boston
harbor, and new regiments
soon followed in their transports.
Presently one could count thirty ships of war at their moorings before
the town, and the morning drum-beats summoned to the roll-call strong
garrisons at Castle William, in Boston itself, and at Salem, now the capital.
It was known that arms were stopped, if any one tried to carry them from
Boston; and it soon became evident to Gage that it was best to concentrate
his force, for he removed his headquarters from Danvers<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> to Boston,
and thither his two regiments followed him. Perhaps he had heard of the
enthusiasm of a certain young officer, whom he had seen twenty years before,
saving all that was saved, on Braddock's bloody day; and how, surviving
for the present crisis, he had just declared, in distant Virginia, that he
was ready to raise, subsist, and march a thousand men to Boston. Gage
must have known George Washington quite as well as the Bostonians did,
who were, it is to be feared, better prepared on their part to look upon
Israel Putnam, as he marched into town from Connecticut with a drove
of sheep for the hungered populace, as a greater hero than the Virginian
colonel.</p>

<p>September came in, and it did not look as if the conflict could be put off
longer.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> On the first of that month Gage sent a detachment to the Powder
House beyond Quarry Hill, in the present Somerville, and it brought
away ammunition and cannon and took them to the castle.</p>

<p>News of the
inroad spread, and on the next day crowds gathered in Cambridge with
arms in their hands. They assembled before Lieutenant-Governor Oliver's
house<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> and forced him to resign. Joseph Warren, in Boston, heard of the
tumult and hastened to the spot. His influence prevailed, and the sun
went down without the shedding of blood. It was ominous, however, to
Gage, and he set to work rebuilding the old lines across Boston Neck, and
constructing barracks. He soon encountered difficulties. Somehow laborers
could not be hired, nor provisions be bought. Somehow his freight-barges
sunk, his carts of straw got on fire, his wagons were sloughed; and
somehow, with all his vigilance, a few young men made up for the loss of
the powder-house pieces by stealthily carrying off by night some cannon
from Boston,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> besides some others from an old battery in Charlestown. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was soon found that the men on the Neck lines needed protection, and Admiral
Graves tried to send up a sloop of war into the South bay to enfilade
the road from Roxbury, if occasion came; but her draught was too much,
and so he employed an armed schooner. By November the works were
finished. Warren thought them as formidable as Gage could make them,
but the old Louisbourg soldiers laughed at them and called them mud
walls.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in October, the military spirit was taking shape throughout
the province. On the 5th the legislative assembly, which had met at Salem
on Gage's call, though he sought to outlaw them by rescinding (September
28) his precept, had declared his attempted revocation without warrant in
law, and had resolved itself into a provincial congress. The body then adjourned
to meet in Concord, where, under John Hancock's presidency, they
appointed a Committee of Safety to act as the executive of the province,
and chose three general officers,&mdash;Preble,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Ward, and Pomeroy. The militia
was organized, and minute-men were everywhere forming into companies.
Gordon tells how the country was astir with preparations. Connecticut
was not far behind in ordering her militia to be officered, and in
directing her towns to double their stock of ammunition, while she voted
to issue £15,000 in paper money,&mdash;the first of the war.</p>

<p>"An armed truce", wrote Benjamin Church, "is the sole tenure by
which the inhabitants of Boston possess life, liberty, and property." Away
from Boston, the towns made common cause. "Liberty and Union" was
to be read on a flag flying in Taunton. When news of these and similar
events reached England, Lord North told Hutchinson that, for aught he
could see, it must come to violence, with consequent subjection for the
province.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> When such tidings reached Virginia it found her officers just
sheathing their swords after their conflict with the Indians in the mountains,
and resolving next to turn their weapons against the oppressors of
America. Gage, in Boston, whom Warren really felt to be honest and
desirous of an accommodation, was awaking to a juster measure of the
task of the ministry, which might, he said, require 20,000 troops to begin
with. As he pondered on such views, he might have heard, on the evening
of the 9th of November, 1774, the ringing of the bells which greeted the
return of Sam. Adams and his colleagues from the Philadelphia congress.
Shortly after the middle of the month the British in Boston went into winter
quarters.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> So November passed;&mdash;the Committee of Safety had arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to raise and support an army, and the recommendation of the Continental
Congress had been approved.</p>

<p>December came. Boston was not yet burned, as some in London believed
it was when Quincy heard them laying wagers in the coffee-houses,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
and if Sam. Adams was not the first politician in the world, as others told
the same ardent young Bostonian, he was sharing conspicuous honors at
home, with his distant kinsman, John Adams. The latter, as Novanglus,
in his public controversy with the unknown Massachusettensis, was just
attracting renewed attention. But that sturdy patriot, while he was arguing
in public, was comforting himself in private by reckoning that Massachusetts
could put 25,000 men in the field in a week; and New England,
he counted, had 200,000 fighting men, "not exact soldiers", he confessed,
"but all used to arms."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Tidings were coming in which told how this warlike
spirit might be tested. Governor Wanton, of Rhode Island, had spirited
away from the reach of the British naval officers forty-four cannon,
which were at Newport. Paul Revere had gone down to Portsmouth and
harangued the Sons of Liberty, till they invaded Fort William and Mary
and (December 14, 1774) carried off the powder and cannon.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> From Maryland,
where they had lately been burning a tea-ship,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> the word was that
its convention had ordered the militia to be enrolled. From Pennsylvania
it appeared that Thomas Mifflin was conspicuous among the Quakers in advocating
the measure of non-intercourse. From South Carolina the news
was halting. Could her rice-planters succeed in getting their product excepted
from such a plan? They did. Gage had some time before<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> written
to Dartmouth that they were as mad in the southern Charlestown as in
northern Boston; and when one of their Tory parsons had intimated that
clowns should not meddle with politics, they had been as fiery as they could
have been in Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Gordon, of Jamaica Plain, in appending
notes to a sermon which he had just preached on the Provincial Thanksgiving
of December 15, 1774, refers to the brave lead of Virginia in the
present time, as nine years before she had been foremost in the stamp-act
time.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Governor Dunmore was reporting to Dartmouth (December, 1774)
that every county in Virginia was arming a company of men, to be ready
as occasion required.</p>

<p>John Adams, at Philadelphia, read to Patrick Henry from a paper of
Joseph Hawley, that the result of the action of the ministry rendered it
necessary to fight. "I am of that man's opinion", replied the ardent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Virginian.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> With the new year (1775) that opinion was becoming widespread.
<i>Ames' Almanac</i> (1775), published in Boston, was printing, for almost every
family in New England to read, "a method for making gunpowder", so
that every person "may easily supply himself with a sufficiency of that
commodity." Day by day news came to Boston from every direction of
the indorsement of Congress, and of the wild-fire speed of the dispersion
of the military spirit. Those who remembered the 40,000 men who
marched towards Boston at the time of the D'Anville scare, thirty years before,
said the enthusiasm then was nothing like the present. Somehow
Gage began to feel more confident. He had in January 3,500 men in his
Boston garrison, and almost as many more were expected, and he did not
hesitate to send (January 23) Captain Balfour and a hundred men, with two
cannon, to Marshfield, to protect the two hundred loyalists there, who had
signed the articles by which Timothy Ruggles was hoping to band the
friends of government together, and the reports which Balfour sent back
seemed to satisfy the governor that the measure was effective.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>On the first of February, 1775, the second provincial congress assembled
at Cambridge, and they soon issued a solemn address to the people, deprecating
a rupture, but counselling preparations for it.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> It was not then
known that Gage had won over Dr. Church, and that through this professing
patriot the British headquarters in Boston were informed of the doings
of congress. Church's defection encouraged the tories, and on the 6th,
handbills appeared in Boston, reminding the patriots of the fate of Wat
Tyler.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> A few days later Cambridge was alarmed by the report that troops
were coming out of Boston to disperse them; but the day passed without
the proof of it. The Committee of Safety were anxious, for they knew that
the other colonies and their friends in England were fearful that the conflict
would be precipitated without the consent of congress; and the authority
of congress was now so dominant that its cognizance of such measures
was essential to the continuance of the sympathy with Massachusetts
which now existed. No one at this time was more solicitous for this prudent
measure than Joseph Hawley, and no one in Massachusetts had a
steadier head. On the 18th Peter Oliver wrote from Boston to London:
"Great preparations on both sides for an engagement, and the sooner it
comes the better."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> "Every day, every hour widens the breach!" wrote
Warren to Arthur Lee, two days later.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Already the provincial congress
had conferred on the Committee of Safety (February 9) the power to assemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the militia, and John Thomas and William Heath had been added
to the general officers. The committee, on the 21st, had voted to buy supplies
for 15,000 men, including twenty hogsheads of rum. On the same
day Sam. Adams and Warren signed a letter to the friends of liberty in
Canada, and secret messengers were already passing that way. Presently,
on the 26th, the impending conflict was once more averted.</p>

<p>Colonel David Mason, of Salem, had been commissioned by the Committee
of Safety as an engineer, and was now at work in that town mounting
some old cannon which had been taken from the French. Gage heard of
it, and by his orders a transport appeared at Marblehead, with about 300
men under Lieutenant-Colonel Leslie, who rapidly landed and marched his
men to Salem. Their purpose was seasonably divined; the town was
aroused, and, in the presence of a mob, the commander thought it safer to
turn upon his steps.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> A British officer, Colonel Smith, with one John
Howe, was at about the same time sent out in disguise to scour the country
towards Worcester, and pick up news for Gage;<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> and two others, Brown
and Bernière, were a few weeks later prowling about Concord.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> The patriots
did not scour for news. It came in like the wind,&mdash;now of county
meetings, now of drills, now of Colonel Washington's ardor in Virginia,
and now of Judge Drayton's charge to the grand jury in Carolina.</p>

<p>Early in March came the anniversary of the Boston massacre. Two days
before, Judge Auchmuty, in Boston, wrote to Hutchinson: "I don't see
any reason to expect peace and order until the fatal experiment of arms is
tried.... Bloodshed and desolation seem inevitable."<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> While this tory
was writing thus, the patriots, in a spirit that somewhat belied their professed
wish to avoid a conflict, were arranging for a public commemoration
of the massacre. It could have been omitted without any detriment to the
cause, and to observe it could easily have begotten trouble amid the inflamed
passions of both sides. "We may possibly be attacked in our trenches",
said Sam. Adams. It little conduced to peace that Joseph Warren was
selected to deliver the address, which, as the fifth came on Sunday, was delivered
on Monday, the sixth. The concourse of people suggested to Warren
to enter the Old South meeting-house, where the crowd was assembled,
by a ladder put against a window in the rear of the pulpit. Forty British
officers were present, and the moderator offered them front seats, and some
of the officers placed themselves on the pulpit stairs. A contemporary story
says that it was a set purpose of the officers to break up the meeting,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and that one of them took an egg in his pocket, to be thrown at the
speaker for a signal. This man tripped as he entered the building, and the
egg was broken before its time. Another officer, below the desk, held up
some bullets in his open palm as Warren warmed in his eloquence. The
speaker quietly  dropped his handkerchief on the
leaden menace, and went on. So the meeting
came to an end, with no outbreak; though there
was some hissing and pounding of canes when
the vote of thanks was put. As the crowd
came out of the  meeting-house there was an apprehensive
moment,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> for the Forty-third Regiment
chanced to be passing, with beating
drums, and for an instant the outcome was
uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Gage had suffered the commemoration
to pass without recognition,
but ten days later his officers made the
event the subject of a provoking burlesque,
when Dr. Thomas Bolton delivered from
the balcony of the British Coffee House in
King Street a mock oration in ridicule of
Warren, Hancock, and Adams.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> There
was no knowing what purpose this ridicule
might mask; and a committee of the patriots,
mostly mechanics, were constantly
following the progress of events, meeting
secretly at the Green Dragon<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> for consultation,
and setting watches at Charlestown,
Cambridge, and Roxbury, to give
warning if there were any signs that the
royal troops were preparing to move from
the town.</p>

<p>On the 22d March, 1775, the provincial congress assembled again at
Concord, and set to work in organizing their army, and in devising an address
to the Mohawks, with the purpose of securing them to the patriot side.
They also prepared to use the Stockbridge Indians as mediators with their
neighbors, who were already tampered with, as was believed or alleged, by
emissaries from Canada. It was already known that the people of the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Hampshire Grants were preparing to seize Ticonderoga as soon as the war-cloud
should burst.</p>

<p>News sped rapidly by relays of riders. It was not long after Patrick
Henry had said in Virginia,
"We must fight; an appeal
to arms and to the God of
hosts is all that is left for
us",<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> before the words were
familiar in Massachusetts,
and John Adams, who knew,
said that Virginia was planting
wheat instead of tobacco.
At Providence they were
burning tea in the streets,
and men went about erasing
the advertisements of the obnoxious
herb from the shop-windows.
Everywhere they
were quoting the incendiary
speech of John Wilkes, the
lord mayor of London, whose
retorts upon the ministry
were relished as they were
read in the public prints.
As if to test whether March
should pass without bloodshed,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
Gage on the 30th sent
Earl Percy out of town with
a brigade, in light marching
order, and he went four
miles, to Jamaica Plain, and
returned. The minute-men
gathered in the neighboring
towns, but no encounter took
place.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>So April came, with the
rattle of the musket still unheard.
On the second day
two vessels arrived at Marblehead,
bringing tidings that Parliament had pledged its support to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
king and his ministers, and that more troops were coming. On the 8th a
committee reported to the provincial congress on an armed alliance of the
New England colonies, and messengers were sent to the adjacent governments.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
Connecticut responded with equipping six regiments; New Hampshire
organized her forces as a part "of the New England army", and
Rhode Island voted to equip fifteen hundred men. In Virginia it looked
for a while as if the appeal to arms would not be long delayed, for Dunmore
fulminated against their convention; and he even threatened to turn
the slaves against their masters, and he did seize the powder at Williamsburg,
of which the province had small store at best. Calmer counsels prevailed,
and the armed men who had gathered at Fredericksburg dispersed
to reassemble at call.</p>

<p class="p2">The contest meanwhile had been precipitated in Massachusetts. The
rumor had already gone to England that it was close at hand. Hutchinson,
in London, on the 10th, when writing to his son in Boston, had said: "Before
this reaches you it will be determined;" and while tidings of the actual
conflict was on the way, Hutchinson learned in London that Pownall had
been prepared by letters from Boston for something startling.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The circle
of sympathizers with America were in this suspense while Franklin was on
the ocean, hither bound, and, if we may believe Strahan, he had left England
in a rancorous state of mind, causing men to wonder what he intended
on arriving, whether to turn general and fight, or to bolster in other ways
the spirits of the rebels.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> When he arrived the fight had begun.</p>

<p>On the 15th of April the provincial congress had adjourned. On the
16th, Isaiah Thomas spirited his press out of Boston and took it to Worcester,
where, in a little more than a fortnight, the <i>Massachusetts Spy</i> reappeared.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
Families, impressed with the forebodings of the sky, were moving
out of town. Samuel Adams and Hancock had been persuaded to retire to
Lexington,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> to be beyond the grasp of Gage, who was shortly expected to
order the arrest of the patriots, for which he had had instructions since
March 18th.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> The Boston committee of observation was watchful. It
had noticed that on the 14th the "Somerset" frigate had changed her
moorings to a position intermediate between Boston and Charlestown, and
on the 15th the transports were hauled near the men-of-war. Notice of
these signs was sent to Hancock and Adams, and preparations were begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
for removing a part of the stores at Concord. When, during the afternoon
of the 18th, some of the precious cannon were trundled into Groton, her
minute-men gathered for a night march to Concord. During that same
day Gage sent out from Boston some officers to patrol the roads towards
Concord, and intercept the patriot messengers, and to discover, if possible,
the lurking-place of Adams and Hancock. In the evening it was observed
in Boston that troops were marching across the Common to the inner bay.
William Dawes was at once dispatched to Concord by way of Roxbury,
for the patriot watch had not been without information before the troops
actually moved. Gordon tells us that they got a warning from a "daughter
of liberty unequally yoked in point of politics", and as Gage's wife was a
daughter of Peter Kemble, of New Jersey, it has been surmised that the
informer may have been one very near to headquarters.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Paul Revere immediately
caused the preconcerted signal-light to be set in a church-tower
at the north end of Boston, and crossing the river in a boat, he mounted a
horse on the Charlestown side and started on his famous midnight ride. It
was none too soon. At eleven o'clock eight hundred men, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Smith, were passing over the back bay in boats to Lechmere
Point. Here they landed at half past two in the morning, and the
moon at this hour was well up. They marched quietly and rapidly, but not
unobserved, and when they approached Lexington Green they found drawn
up there a company of minute-men. Smith had become alarmed when, as
he was advancing, he found the country aroused in every direction, and
sent back for reinforcements. Earl Percy, with the succor, was by some
stupidity<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> delayed, and did not get off from Boston till between nine and
ten the next morning, and he then took the circuitous route by Roxbury
and Cambridge.</p>

<p>The critical moment on Lexington Green had then long passed. Major
Pitcairn, who commanded Smith's advance-guard, would not or could not
prevent that fatal volley in the early morning light, by which several of the
small body of provincials were killed before they broke, while, by a scattering
return fire, one or two of the British were wounded.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Smith, without
being aware that Hancock and Adams were at the moment within sound
of his musketry, and just then being conducted farther from his reach,
waited while his troops gave three cheers, and then resumed his march,
passing on towards Concord. The provincials gathered their dead and
wounded, and managed as the British passed on to pick up a few stragglers,
the first prisoners of the war.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>On the redcoats went as the day broadened.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> They followed the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
much as it runs to-day, though in places steeps and impediments are now
avoided by a better grade. Their march went by the spots which the genius
of Hawthorne and Emerson have converted into shrines. In the centre
of Concord they halted, while the gathering provincials, who had retired
before them, watched the smoke of devastation. Smith had detailed two
detachments to find and destroy stores. One of these, sent to Colonel Barrett's,
beyond the North Bridge, had some success, and while it was absent
the provincials, now increased in numbers from the neighboring towns, approached
a guard which had been left at the bridge. Here the British fired
at the Americans across the stream, and the volley being returned, a few
were killed on both sides, before the British guard retreated upon the main
body, whither they were soon followed by the other detachment which was
out. Smith took two hours to gather wagons for his wounded and make
preparations for his retreat, which had now become imperative, for the
militia were seen swarming on the hills.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> When Smith started he threw
out a flanking party on his left, which followed a ridge running parallel to
his march; but when the sloping of the land compelled the flankers to
descend to the level of the road, the British lost the advantage which the
ridge gave them, and the minute-men, who now began to strike the British
line of march at every angle, waylaid them at cross-roads, and dropped an
incessant fire upon them from copse, hill, and stone wall, until the retreating
troops, impeded with their wounded, and leaving many of their dying
and dead, huddled along the road like sheep beset by dogs. Just on the
easterly outskirts of Lexington they met Percy, whose ranks opened and
received the fugitives; and Stedman, the British historian who was with
Percy, tells us how the weary men hung out their tongues as they cumbered
the ground during their halt. It was near two o'clock, and Percy planted
his cannon to keep his assailants at bay, while his troops, now about eighteen
hundred in number, rested and refreshed themselves. Before this, his
baggage train, which had been delayed in crossing the bridge from Brighton
to Cambridge so as to fall far behind his hastening column, had been
captured, with its guard, by a crowd of old men some distance below, at
Menotomy.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> When Percy limbered his pieces and his troops fell again into
column, the hovering militia renewed the assault. As pursuer and pursued
crossed West Cambridge plain the action was sharp. Percy did not
dare attempt to turn towards the boats which Smith had left at Lechmere
Point, and any intention he may have had of halting at Cambridge
and fortifying was long vanished. So he pursued the road which led
towards Charlestown Neck. Several hundred militiamen, who had come
up from Essex County,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> were nearly in time at Winter Hill to cut the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
British off in their precipitate retreat, and "God knows", said Washington,
when he learned the facts, "it could not have been more so." Percy, however,
slipped by, and as darkness was coming on, the fire of the pursuers
began to slacken as they approached Bunker Hill. Here, with the royal
ships covering their flanks, the British halted, and, facing about, formed a
line and prepared to make a stand. General Heath, who during the latter
part of the day had been on the ground, drew off his militia, and at the
foot of Prospect Hill held the first council of war of the now actual hostilities.
Warren, early in the day hastening from Boston across the river,
had galloped towards the scene of conflict. When he encountered Percy's
column on its way out, he seems to have evaded it and joined General
Heath, then taking cross-roads to intercept the pursuing militia. Heath
took the command of the provincials soon after Percy resumed his march.
From this time Warren, as chairman of the committee in Boston, kept near
Heath, for counsel if need be, and Heath says that on the West Cambridge
plain a musket-ball struck a pin from Warren's earlock.</p>

<p>No one could tell what would happen next, after this suddenly improvised
army had begun to rendezvous that night in Cambridge. As the
straggling parties, in bivouac and in what shelter they could find, compared
experiences and counted the missing, messengers were hurrying in every
direction with the tidings of the war at last begun!<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>On the 20th of April there was much to do beside picking up the dead
that may have been left over night along the road from Concord. The
Committee of Safety<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> were summoning all the towns to send their armed
men to Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Warren was writing to Gage to beg better facilities
for getting the women and children, with family effects, out of Boston.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
These were busy days for that ardent patriot. The militia were beginning
to pour in, and Warren must do the chief work in reducing the mob to
order. Congress comes to Watertown, and Warren, in the absence of
Hancock, must preside. He bids God-speed to Samuel Adams and John
Hancock<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> as they start for the Continental Congress. He hears with a
sinking heart of the vessel which arrived at Gloucester on the 26th, bringing
the body of Josiah Quincy, so lately warm that, when the tidings
reached Cambridge of his death, Warren supposed he had lived to get
ashore.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

The background is much the same as that of a
portrait of Washington in the same work, and
the print, issued in Boston, where Heath was
well known, shows what kind of effigies then
passed current. A portrait of Heath by H. Williams
has been engraved by J. R. Smith. (<i>Catal.

was born in Roxbury, March 2, 1737, and died
Jan. 24, 1814. His service was constant during
the war, though his deeds were not brilliant.
He seems conspicuously to have acquired the regard
of Washington; though Bancroft calls him
vain, honest, and incompetent. His papers are

<p>Another day Warren is busy carrying out the behests of the Committee
of Safety respecting their scant artillery. At another time he is encouraging
wagoners to go into Boston to bring out the friends of the cause
and their property; but it was not so easy to get Gage's permission, and as
the tories made a plea that these Boston patriots were necessary hostages,
obstacles were thrown in the way.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> There were rumors, too, of an intention
of the royal troops once more to raid upon the country. Only two
days after the 19th of April, Ipswich was wild with such rumors, and the
alarm spread to the New Hampshire line<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> and beyond.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>The patriots at Cambridge were not pleased when they found that the
Connecticut assembly had sent a committee to bear a letter from Governor
Trumbull (April 28) and to confer with Gage.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> There was a feeling that
the time had passed for such things, and Warren wrote (May 2) a letter beseeching
the sister colony to stand by Massachusetts, which elicited from
Trumbull a response sufficiently assuring.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>Already there was a proposition warlike enough from a Connecticut captain
who had just led his company to Cambridge, and was now urging the
seizure of Ticonderoga and its stores. The proposition was timely. During
the previous winter the patriots had learned that the British government
was intending to separate the colonies by securing the line of the
Hudson.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Accordingly the instigator of this counter-movement was ordered,
May 3d, to carry it out, and Benedict Arnold makes his first appearance
in American history. Meanwhile, however, acting upon hints which
Arnold had already dropped before leaving
Connecticut, or perhaps anticipating
such hints, some gentlemen in that colony,
joining with others of Pittsfield, in
Massachusetts, had gone to Bennington, where, on the day before Arnold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
was commissioned, they had been joined by Col. Ethan Allen. Thus the plan
which Arnold had at heart was likely to be carried out before he could
arrive from Cambridge. A few days later the command of the force which
had gathered naturally fell to Allen as having the largest personal following,
and this following was loyal enough to their leader to threaten to
abandon the enterprise if Arnold, who arrived very soon, should press his
rights to the command. By a sort of compromise, Allen and Arnold now
shared amicably the leadership. Less than a hundred men had reached the
neighborhood of the fort on the morning of May 10, when, in the early
dawn, the two leaders, overpowering the sentinels at the sally-port, reached
the parade-ground with their men, and forced an immediate surrender from
the commandant, still in his night-clothes. Fifty men and nearly two hundred
cannon, and many military stores, were thus promptly and easily
secured. More than a hundred other pieces were added, when, on the 12th,
Colonel Seth Warner,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> with a coöperating detachment, seized the post at
Crown Point, and shortly afterwards Bernard Romans took possession of
Fort George.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>On the 14th some of Arnold's belated men reached him with a captured

<p>The military anxiety was increasing. Thomas had but 700 men at Roxbury,
which he tried to magnify in the British eyes by marching them in
and out of sight, so as to make the same men serve the appearance of many
more. On the 8th of May there was an alarm that the royal troops were
coming out, and the militia of the near towns were summoned.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> To put
on an air of confidence, a few days later (May 13), Putnam, from Cambridge,
marched with 2,200 men into Charlestown and out again, without
being molested, though part of the time within range of the enemy's guns.
It was the military assertion of the idea, which the day before the Watertown
congress had expressed, of governing themselves. "It is astonishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
how they have duped the whole continent", wrote Gage to Dartmouth,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
and perhaps he had not heard even then of the last victory of opinion
down in Georgia, where parishes of New England descent were forcing
issues with their neighbors.</p>

<p>The Committee of Safety now resolved to remove the live-stock from the
islands in Boston Harbor; and Gage, on his part, determined on securing
some hay on Grape Island, near Weymouth. These counter-forays led to
fighting, and for some weeks the harbor was alive with skirmishing.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Meanwhile
the Massachusetts congress had urged Connecticut to let Arnold
bring some of the cannon captured on Lake Champlain to Cambridge,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> and
the day before the brush occurred at Grape Island they had delivered (May
20) a commission as commander-in-chief of the Massachusetts troops to
Artemas Ward. In Boston the remaining loyalists were soon cheered by
advices promising large reinforcements, which they now confidently began
to expect,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and the feeling grew apace among the beleaguerers that a better
organization and a closer dependence of the colonies among themselves
were necessary to meet the impending dangers. Dr. Langdon, the president
of Harvard College, in the election sermon<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> on the day when the new
provincial congress met (May 31), had recognized the general obedience
which was already paid to the advice of the Continental Congress. There
were not a few who remembered how, twenty years before, the young Virginian,
Colonel George Washington, had come to Boston, and who recalled
the good impression he had made. They had heard lately of the active interest
and sympathy with the patriots' cause which he was manifesting
among his neighbors in that colony. On the 4th of May, Elbridge Gerry,
with the approval of Warren, wrote to the Massachusetts delegates at Philadelphia,
that they would "rejoice to see this way the beloved Colonel
Washington" as generalissimo.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> This was the feeling, while the army
which lay about Boston was a mere inchoate mass, far from equal to the
task which they had undertaken; but brave words did much; brave spirits
did more; and John Adams was writing from Philadelphia that one "would
burst to see whole companies of armed Quakers in that city, in uniforms,
going through the manual."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> The tories in Boston looked on with mingled
fear and confidence. "We are daily threatened", wrote Chief-justice
Oliver from Boston (June 10), "with an attack by fire-rafts, whale-boats, and
what not."<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>One of the new British generals now lent his literary skill to
his commanding general, for Burgoyne was a playwright and had an easy
way of vaporing, which was quite apparent in Gage's proclamation of June
12,<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> to warn the rebellious and infatuated multitudes, and to hold out forgiveness

to attack the rebels, "which every day becomes more necessary."<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>On the 14th Warren was made the second major-general of the Massachusetts
forces, and his active spirit gave encouragement, since the inalertness
of Ward was creating much concern. Early in the morning of the 17th
Warren left Watertown, and the provincial congress convened without him,
but they knew the emergency. A broadside exists of this day, in which
they call upon the neighboring militia to hold themselves in readiness. In
the anxious hours of this, St. Botolph's day,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> with all eyes on Boston, the
Continental Congress had chosen Washington to be their military chief,<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
and had adopted the forces which were about to show that Boston was not
besieged idly. It took time then for Cambridge to know what was happening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in Philadelphia; but the assembled legislators at Watertown might well
hope for what had really happened, when, as the fateful day wore on, messengers
arrived, declaring that the Continental funds were to be used to
help supply this beggared army, and that all the aspirations of its provincial
congress to set up a civil government of their own had met the approval
of the continent.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>Now to look at the military situation. Already John Thomas, a physician
of Kingston, had been made second in command under Ward; and
Richard Gridley, an old Louisbourg artilleryman, had been made chief engineer.
As yet the New England colonies were the only ones which had
sent their armed men to the scene. The Massachusetts men had taken
post mostly at Cambridge, near the college; and here, as the days went on,
came also a Connecticut regiment under Israel Putnam, who had left his
plough in its furrow. So, as June began, there had assembled on this
side of Boston between seven and eight thousand men, eager, but poorly
equipped, and with a small supply of powder. On the Roxbury side, fronting
the British lines on Boston Neck, there were about four thousand Massachusetts
men, under John Thomas, supported by a camp a little farther
out, at Jamaica Plain, to which Joseph Spencer had come with another Connecticut
regiment, and Nathanael Greene, with a body of Rhode Islanders.
Thomas had some field-pieces and a few heavy cannon, and his force constituted
the army's right wing. Its left wing was upon the Mystick at Medford,
and near Charlestown Neck, and here were the New Hampshire men,
and among their officers the old Indian fighter, John Stark, was conspicuous.
Three companies of Massachusetts men constituted the extreme left
at Chelsea. So, as the summer came on, perhaps about 16,000 men in all
were encamped as a fragile army besieging Boston. General Ward exercised
by sufferance a superior authority over all, though as yet no colony
but New Hampshire had instructed its troops to yield him obedience. As
Massachusetts claimed three quarters of the entire force thus drawn together,
the assumption of chief command by her first officer was natural
enough in a common cause.</p>

<p>The force which this sixteen thousand loosely organized men dared to
hold imprisoned in Boston was a well-compacted army of somewhere from
five to ten thousand men, for it is difficult amid conflicting reports to determine
confidently a fixed number. On the 25th of May Gage had been
joined by a reinforcement, accompanied by three other general officers,&mdash;Burgoyne,
Clinton, and Howe.</p>

<p>The council of war at Cambridge was meanwhile directing new works to
be constructed, strengthening and stretching their lines of circumvallation.
Its opinions were divided on the question of occupying so exposed a position
as the most prominent eminence on the peninsula of Charlestown, the
defence of which might bring on a general engagement, which their stock
of powder could not support. On the 13th of June the American commanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
had secretly learned that Gage intended on the 18th to take possession
of Dorchester Heights, the present South Boston. There was but
one counter-move to make, and that was to seize in anticipation the summit
of the ridgy height which began at Charlestown Neck and extended, in varying
outline, to the seaward end of the peninsula,&mdash;an eminence known
as Bunker Hill. On the 16th of June, a council of war, held in the house
near Cambridge common, known then as the Hastings and later as the
Holmes House,<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> decided, upon the recommendation of the Committee of
Safety, to occupy Bunker Hill at once.</p>

</div></div>

<p>That evening about 1,200 men,
of whom 200 were from Connecticut under Thomas Knowlton, the whole
being under the command of Colonel
William Prescott, first listened to a
prayer of the president of the college,
and then marched, with their intrenching
tools, in the darkness, to Charlestown Neck.</p>

</div>

<p>Here the purpose was
for the first time disclosed to the men. They resumed their march, going
up the slope of the hill before them, while Nutting's company and a
few Connecticut men were sent along the shore opposite Boston, to patrol
it. The highest summit of the hill was the one first reached; but, after a
consultation, it was decided to proceed to a lower one, more nearly before
Boston. Here Richard Gridley marked out a redoubt, and at midnight the
men took their spades and began to throw up the breastworks. Putnam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
who seems to have accompanied Prescott, now returned to Cambridge, and
while the men worked busily, Prescott sent an additional patrol to the river,
and twice went down himself, to be satisfied, as he heard the "All's well"
of the watch on the men-of-war moored opposite, that no noise of the intrenching
tools had reached the enemy. Soon after the first glimmer of
dawn on the 17th, the sailors on the ships discovered the embankments,
now about six feet high, when one of the vessels, the "Lively", at once
opened fire upon them. This lasted only till Admiral Graves could send
orders to cease, but was shortly renewed from the ships and from the batteries
on Copp's Hill, in Boston, as soon as the British generals comprehended
the situation. Prescott's men meanwhile kept at their work. One
man was soon killed by a cannon-ball. The commander and others walked
the parapet, encouraging their men, and Willard, one of the councillors
who stood by Gage as they surveyed the hill through their glasses, recognized
the Pepperell colonel, and told the British general what sort of
man he had got to encounter. A promise had been given to Prescott that
in the morning a relief and refreshments would be sent from Cambridge;
but nothing came to the hungry men, as they still worked. Ward, who
heard the firing, yielded to Putnam's persuasion to send reinforcement, only
so far as to despatch a part of Stark's regiment, for he feared that Gage
would seem to prepare to assault in Charlestown, while his intention might
be to attack in Cambridge. Finally, about ten o'clock, Major John Brooks<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
reached headquarters with a request
from Prescott for help and food. Richard
Devens pressed Ward to comply,
and at eleven the rest of the New Hampshire
men were ordered to march.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the tide rose, some floating batteries were sent up the
stream to take the works in flank, and later, to rake the Neck. A few stray
shots were returned from a single field-piece in the redoubt, one of whose
balls passed over Burgoyne's head, as he tells us, while he was watching
at Copp's Hill. Putnam came again from Cambridge, and induced Prescott
to send off a large number of his men with the intrenching tools, and
under Putnam's direction this detail soon began to use them in throwing
up earthworks on the higher summit in the rear,&mdash;labor wasted, as it turned
out.</p>

</div>

<p>As the day wore on, Gage held a council of war, and it was determined
not to land troops at the Neck and attack in rear, as Clinton urged, but
to assault in front. This decision was long the ground of severe criticism
upon Gage, and ruined his military reputation. The ships were put
into better positions, and redoubled their fire. By
noon the British troops in Boston were marching to
the wharves, where they embarked in boats, and, under
the command of General Howe, they rowed to Moulton's or Morton's Point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
where the landing was quickly made.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Howe drew up his men on the rising
ground which makes the least of the three heights of the peninsula, and
anticipating sharp work, sent back the boats for more men.</p>

<p>Prescott observed all this from the hill, but looked longingly up the
peninsula for his own reinforcements. A few wagons came, not with men,
but with beer, though nothing adequate even of this. The feeling began
to spread among the men on the hill that they had been treacherously left
to their fate; but they got encouragement from a few brave souls who
came straggling in from Cambridge. Pomeroy, the French war veteran,
was one. James Otis, wreck as he was, came.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> So did Warren, whose
presence the men recognized by a cheer, and, major-general as he was, he
came to fight under Colonel Prescott. Putnam, too, had again returned,
and was seen riding about the field in a restless way, with a word of encouragement
here and there, and pointing out to a few reinforcements now
arriving where best to go.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-137a.jpg" width="200" height="79" id="i137a"

         title="" />
</div>

<p>Prescott's eye, observing Howe's dispositions, saw he was aiming to advance
along the Mystick and take the redoubt in reverse. So Knowlton,
with two field-pieces and the Connecticut troops, were sent down the hill
towards the Mystick, where they began to make a line of defence of a low
stone wall, which was topped by a two-rail
fence. Stark and Reed, with the
New Hampshire regiments, diminished
somewhat by details which Putnam had
taken from them to help the work in the
trenches on the higher hill, soon came up and ranged their men in a line
with Knowlton. There was, however, an interval between this part of the
field and the breastwork and redoubt, which offered a chance for the enemy
to intervene and break the line. An attempt was made to prepare for such
a contingency by grouping the few guns which they had at this point.
New troops, in small numbers, continued to come up, and they were placed
in position as best they could be to keep the line strong in all parts as it
sloped away from the crowning redoubt towards either river.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-137b.jpg" width="150" height="78" id="i137b"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>It was nearing three o'clock when the British boats returned from Boston;
and when their troops landed Howe had about 3,000 men in array.
He pushed his guns forward and got them in position to play upon the
American field-pieces, and soon drove them away, while at the same time
some skirmishing took place on the British flanks,
whose main body was now advancing in a measured
step in two columns: one led by Howe
against the rail-fence, the other by Pigot against
the redoubt. The assault was become one of infantry
only, for the British guns were soon mired in some soft ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the balls in reserve had proved of an over-calibre.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Pigot's front got near
the redoubt before the Americans poured in their fire, which was deadly
enough to send the staggered column wildly back. At the same time, along
the Mystick Howe's advance was met by the American field-pieces, some of
which had been drawn to the rail-fence. Their musketry fire was reserved,
as at the redoubt, and when it belched upon the deployed enemy it produced
the same effect. So there was a recoil all along the British line. In
the respite before they advanced again, Putnam tried to rally some troops
in the rear, and to get others across the Neck, which the raking fire of the
British vessels was now keeping pretty clear of passers.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> But there was
not time to do much, for Howe was soon again advancing, his artillery
helping him more this time; and to add to the terror of the scene, he had
sent word to Boston to set Charlestown on fire by shells, and the conflagration
had now begun.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> The smoke did not conceal the British advance,<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> and
Prescott and Stark kept their men quiet till the enemy were near enough
to make every shot tell. The result was as during the first attack. The
royal troops struggled bravely; but all along the line they wavered, and
then retreated more precipitately than before.</p>

<p>There was a longer interval before Howe again advanced, and Prescott
used it in making such a disposition of his men as would be best in a hand-to-hand
fight, for neither adequate reinforcements nor supplies had reached
him, and his powder was nearly gone. There was a good deal of confusion
and uncertainty in the rear, all along the road to Cambridge. Ward had
ordered a plenty of troops forward, but few reached the peninsula at all, or
in any shape for service. Putnam did what he could to bring order out of
confusion; but his restless and brandishing method, and his eagerness to
finish the works on Bunker Hill, were not conducive to such results as a
quiet energy best produces. The brave men at the front must still do the
work left for them, with such chance assistance as came.</p>

<p>Howe was rallying his men for a third assault. Major Small had landed
400 marines, to make up in part for the losses. Clinton had seen how confused
the troops were as he looked across the river with his glass, and had
hurried over from Boston to render Howe help as a volunteer aid. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
British general determined now to concentrate his attack upon the works
on the crown of the hill, making only a demonstration against the rail-fence.
He brought his artillery to bear in a way that scoured the breastwork which
flanked the redoubt, and then he attacked. His column reserved their fire
and relied on the bayonet. They met the American fire bravely, but soon
perceived that it slackened; and surmising that the American powder was
failing, they took new courage. Those of the defenders who had ammunition
mowed down the assailants as they mounted the breastworks, Major
Pitcairn among them;<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> but as soon as Prescott saw the defence was hopeless,
he ordered a retreat, and friend and foe mingled together as they
surged out of the sally-port amid the clouds of dust which the trampling
raised, for a scorching sun had baked the new-turned soil. It was now,
while the confused mass of beings rocked along down the rear slope of the
hill, that Warren fell, shot through the head. No one among the Americans
knew certainly that he was dead, as they left him. The British stopped
to form and deliver fire, and there was thus time for a gap to open between
the pursuers and the pursued. The New Hampshire men and others at
the rail-fence, seeing that the redoubt was lost, tenaciously faced the enemy
long enough to prevent Prescott's men from being cut off, and then stubbornly
fell back. Some fresh troops which had come up endeavored to
check the British as they reached the slope which led to the intrenchments
that Putnam had been so solicitous about; but the British wave had now
acquired an impulse which carried it bravely up the hill; and Putnam, skirring
about, was not able to make anybody stand to defend the unfinished
works. So down the westerly slope of the higher summit to the Neck the
provincials fled, and the British followed. The vessels poured in their fire
anew as the huddled runaways crossed the low land, and not till they got
beyond the Neck was there any effectual movement by fresh troops to cover
the retreat. General Howe fired a few cannon shot after them, as he mustered
his forces on the hill. It was now about five o'clock. There was
time in the long summer's day to advance upon Cambridge, but Howe rejected
Clinton's advice to that end, and began, with other troops which had
been sent to him from Boston, to throw up breastworks on the inland
crown of Bunker Hill. Thus spading for their defence, the British passed
the night, while the Americans lay on their arms on Winter and Prospect
hills, or straggled back to Cambridge. There was no disposition on either
side to renew the fight.</p>

<p>Prescott did not conceal his indignation at not having been better supported,
when he made his report at Ward's headquarters. He knew he
had fought well; but neither he nor his contemporaries understood at the
time how a physical defeat might be a moral victory. Not knowing this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
there was little else than mortification over the result,&mdash;indeed, on both
sides. A wild daring had brought the battle on, and something like bravado
had led the British general into a foolhardy direct assault, while more
skilful plans, availing of their ships, might have accomplished more without
the heavy loss which they had endured.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> The British folly was increased
by the way in which they allowed the provincials to make the first
great fight of the war a political force throughout the continent.</p>

<p>The general opinion seems to be that the Americans had about 1,500
men engaged at one time, and that from three to four thousand at different
times took some part in it.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> The British

<p>On the morning of the 18th of June

movement, but nothing came of it, and

<p class="p2">There was a dilemma in New York a
few days later. Governor Tryon, who had been in England, was already
in the harbor ready to land on his return, and Washington was approaching
through Jersey on his way to Boston. It was determined by the city
authorities to address and extend courtesies to
both. The American general chanced to be
ahead, and got the parade and fair words first.
Tryon disembarked a few hours later, and received
the same tributes.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

          <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">WASHINGTON'S HEADS OF LETTER, JULY 10, 1775.</p>
          <p class="pf400">This is about half of the whole as given in
fac-simile in Wilkinson's <i>Memoirs</i>, i. p. 855. The
original is now among the Reed-Washington letters
in the Carter-Brown library. It was the
basis of Washington's first formal official letter
to the president of Congress, which, as written
out by Joseph Reed, is given in Sparks' <i>Washington</i>,
iii. p. 17. It shows the degree of attention
which the general bestowed on his minutes
for his secretary's use.</p>

<p class="pf400">Washington, on his first arrival, had taken
temporary quarters in the house of the president
of the college, known now as the Wadsworth
house (<i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 107; Gay's <i>Pop.
Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. 408), till the finest house in the
town, one of a succession of mansions on the
road to Watertown, was made ready for his use.
These houses, which had all been deserted by
their Tory owners, gave the name of Tory Row
to this part of Cambridge. The one assigned
to Washington's use was a Vassall house, later,
however, known as the Craigie house, when it
became the property of Andrew Craigie, from
whose family it passed to the ownership of Longfellow,
who died in it. Sparks lived in it when
he edited <i>Washington's Writings</i>. It is familiar
in engravings. Cf. <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. p. 113,
with a note on various views of it; and for its
associations, see Samuel Longfellow's <i>Life of H.
W. Longfellow</i>; Irving's <i>Washington</i>, ii. p. 11;
Greene's <i>Hist. View of the Amer. Rev.</i>, p. 220;
<i>Manhattan Mag.</i>, i. 119; Mrs. Lamb's <i>Homes of
America</i>; Gay's <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. 415.
Among the other buildings of Revolutionary associations
still standing in Cambridge are the
Brattle house, the headquarters of Mifflin; the
Vassall house, where Dr. Church was confined;
the house where Jonathan Sewall lived, later occupied
by General Riedesel; the Oliver house,
now owned by James Russell Lowell; the "Bishop's
Palace", where Burgoyne was quartered;
and Christ Church, where Washington attended
service (view in <i>Mass. Mag.</i>, 1792, and compare
Nicholas Hoppin's discourses, Nov. 22, 1857, and
Oct. 15, 1861). For more of the historical associations
of these Cambridge sites, see the <i>Harvard
Book</i>; Drake's <i>Landmarks of Middlesex</i>; the

<p>Among the letters now passing
through New York was one upon that battle, addressed to the President of
Congress, which Washington took the liberty of opening for his own guidance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
After instructing Schuyler, who was to be left in charge of the
forces in New York, to keep watch upon Tryon<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> and Guy Johnson,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Washington
the next day (26th) started for Cambridge. On the 2d of July
Washington reached Watertown, and on the 3d, under a tree still standing,<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
he took command of the army, which thus passed, in effect, under Continental
control, numbering at the time nearly 15,000 men fit for duty.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
To brigade this army, rectify the circumvallating lines, watch the constant
skirmishes, and assign the new bodies of troops arriving to places in the
works, was the labor to which Washington devoted himself at once. On
the 9th of July he held his first council of war,<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> and on the 10th he addressed
his first letter to Congress, describing the condition of the siege
as he had found it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>To guard against surprise, and replenish the magazines, required constant
diligence, and the supply of powder never ceased to be a cause of anxiety
in the one camp, while the diminishing stock of provisions produced
almost as much concern in Boston. The beleaguered British, however, got
some relief from the exodus of the Boston people, which the stress of want
forced the royal commander to permit.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> So the summer was made up of
anxious moments. The independent husbandmen of New England made
but intractable raw recruits, and Washington, who had expected to find discipline
equal to that which the social distinctions of the South gave to the
masses there, was disappointed, and did not wholly conceal his disgust.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
He grew, however, to discern that campaigns could produce that discipline
as well, if not better, than a life of civil subservience. Recruits came in
from the South, and when some of the Northern officers saw the kind of
men that Morgan and others brought as riflemen from Virginia, their comment
was scarcely less austere. "The army would be as well off without
them", said Thomas, who, next to Washington, was the best disciplinarian
in the camp. Of the generals, Lee was, however, by much the most conspicuous.
There was a glamour about the current rumors of his soldierly
experience that obscured what might have been told of his questionable
character.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> His eccentricities were the camp talk, and rather served to
magnify his presence, while it proved dangerous to perambulate the lines
with him and his crowd of dogs, since the exhibition tempted the enemy to
drop their shells in that spot.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Early in July a trumpeter approached the
American lines bringing a letter from General Burgoyne to General Lee,
and the camp straightway proceeded to invest the strange general with
political importance. Burgoyne and Lee were old campaigners together,
and Lee, before he left Philadelphia, had written a stirring letter to the
British general on the bad prospects of the ministerial policy. The letter
which now came was a reply, and proposed a conference on Boston Neck,
to which Congress advised Lee not to accede, and the momentary ripple
subsided.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>In August there was some correspondence with Gage respecting the
treatment of prisoners, in which Washington appears to the better advantage.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>
The correspondence of the American general during the summer
constantly dwells upon the scarcity of powder, though for prudence' sake
he veils his expressions as much as he can. His own troops and even
Congress had no conception of his want, and while Washington hardly
dared fire a salute because of the powder it would take, Richard Henry
Lee, from Philadelphia, was urging him to plant batteries at the mouth of
Boston harbor, and keep the enemy's vessels from coming in and going
out.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Governor Cooke, of Rhode Island, who was doing his best to get
powder from Bermuda, was compelled to keep the secret too. Apparently
Washington did not let his brigade commanders know the whole truth.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
Under these circumstances Washington had no courage to attack, and
Gage, on his part, was content to keep his men from deserting as best he
could.</p>

<p>During September the threatening manœuvres of the British cruisers
along the Connecticut coast<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> kept Governor Trumbull from sending what
powder he had, and there was little hope, when Washington called a
council of war on the 11th, that anything would come of it. There had
been just then some internal manifestations not very reassuring.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> A letter
which Dr. Benjamin Church had tried to get to the British in Newport
harbor had been intercepted, and its cypher interpreted. There was no expressed
defection made clear by it, but suspicions were aroused, and Church,
being arrested, was summoned before the congress at Watertown, where he
made a speech protesting his innocence, but scarcely quieting the suspicions.
He was put under control, and removed from the neighborhood
of the army.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>There was scarce less gratification in the camp at Cambridge in getting
rid of their doubtful associate than was experienced in Boston in getting a
release from their sluggish general. The ministry had saved that soldier's
pride as much as they could in desiring to have him nearer at hand for
counsel;<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> and the sympathetic loyalists whom he had befriended paid him
their compliments in an address. Gage finally, on October 10, issued his
last order, turning over the command to Howe.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>In the middle of October, the burning of Falmouth, the modern Portland,
in Maine, seemed to make it clear that the war was to be conducted
ruthlessly on the British part. Captain Mowatt, with a small fleet, had entered
the harbor and set the town on fire, and to those who communicated
with him it was said that he announced his doings to be but the beginning
of a course of such outrages. When the news reached Washington, he dispatched
Sullivan to Portsmouth, with orders to resist as far as he could
any similar demonstration there.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> What a modern British historian<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> has
called a "wanton and cruel deed" seems to have been but the hasty misjudgment
of an inferior officer, without orders to warrant the act, and the
ministry promptly disowned the responsibility.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> During October, also, a
committee of Congress,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> visiting Washington's camp, could see for themselves
the troubles of their heroic commander. They had not yet heard in
Philadelphia the roar of hostile guns,&mdash;a sensation they might now experience.
They could share Washington's perplexities as the new enlistments
halted upon the expiration of the old,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> and perhaps join in some of

<p class="pf400">The foreground on the left is the summit of Beacon Hill, not far from the spot where the State House now stands, though at a level considerably higher than the
present one. Two of the guns now standing on Cambridge Common were taken from the dock in Boston after the British evacuated it, and they resemble the cannon
here sketched, and one of them may possibly be that identical gun. The spire at the left would seem to be that of the First Church, which stood on the present
Washington Street nearly opposite the head of State Street. (Cf. view of it in <i>Memorial History of Boston</i>, ii. 219.) The spire next to the right must have been
that of the Old South Church. That on the extreme right would seem to be the steeple of the New South (Church Green) in Summer Street, now disappeared.</p>

(1743), and its presence in which and other data led to the suspicion that this 1743 view was from an old plate, which had been originally cut twenty years earlier,
and this was subsequently proven. Cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xviii. 68; xxi. 249. The earliest enlarged view of the house is in the <i>Mass. Mag.</i>, 1789. Cf. <i>Mem. Hist.

The meeting-house (10) on the distant land is that of the First Religious Parish in Roxbury, on the site now occupied by the church near the Norfolk Home. The
American fort just beyond (at 11) was on a rocky summit, where now the stand-pipe of the Cochituate Water Works is placed.</p>

encampments at Prospect Hill, the modern Somerville. The American works between the College and Charles River seem to be intended by 15. The mouth of
the river is seemingly indicated by the point of land just below the number 14, which apparently stands for the Brookline fort and its connections, in the modern
Longwood. Between the man in the foreground and the somewhat abrupt eminence beyond him, was a depression in the outline of the ridge, not far from the head

<p>A little later, Josiah Quincy, who from his house at Braintree could look
out upon the harbor, had been urging Washington to block the channel,
and thus imprison the British ships there at anchor, and prevent the coming
of others. Washington appreciated the motives of that ardent patriot,
but he would have liked better the cannon and powder that would have rendered
the plan feasible.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> At all events, the possible chances of the plan
made not a very pleasant prospect for Howe, who had already set his mind&mdash;as,
indeed, the ministry had already advised<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>&mdash;upon evacuating the
town; but his ships were as yet not sufficient for the task, and hardly sufficient
to protect his supply-boats from the improvised navy which Washington
had been for some time commissioning.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>John Adams, in Philadelphia, was getting uneasy over the apparent inaction
of Washington, and wrote in November (1775) to Mercy Warren that
Mrs. Washington was going to Cambridge,<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> and he hoped she might prove
to have ambition enough for her husband's glory to give occasion to the
Lord to have mercy on the souls of Howe and Burgoyne!<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>The left wing of the beleaguering army was now pushed forward and occupied
Cobble Hill, the site of the present McLean Asylum, and the two
armies watched each other at closer quarters than before, the almost foolhardy
Americans feeling increased confidence when the fortunate captain
of an ordnance brig gave them a supply of munitions. In December, Massachusetts
and New Hampshire<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> promptly supplied the loss of Connecticut
and Rhode Island troops, who were not to be induced to prolong their enlistments.
Washington was cheered with this alacrity of a portion, at least,
of the New England yeomen, and he suffered as many as he could of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
who had come hastily to the camp in the spring to go home on brief furloughs
to make winter provision for their families. Before the year was
out, Congress had authorized Washington to destroy Boston if he found
it necessary. The British general was, on his part, organizing in that town
a Royal Regiment of Highland Emigrants,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> and other loyalist battalions,
putting Ruggles, Forrest, and Gorham in command of them.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>On the first of January, 1776, the federal flag, with its thirteen stripes
and British Union,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> was first raised over the American camp, and their
council of war was inspirited to determine upon an attack, as soon as the
chances of success seemed favorable; but the prudent ones trusted rather
to Howe's evacuating through his straits for provisions, and held back from
the final decision. It was not forgotten that 2,000 men were still without
firelocks, and there was not much powder in the magazines. The total
environing army scarce numbered ten thousand men fit for duty, and they
were stretched out in a long circumvallation, while the enemy could mass
at least half that number on any one point, and had a fleet to sustain them.
Howe had not shown a much more active spirit than Gage had displayed,
and there was a feeling in the British camp that he was too timid for the
task,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> and there could not have been much hopefulness in seeing so much
better a general as Clinton sent off in January with several regiments, to
join other forces and a fleet on the coast of North Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Washington
meanwhile kept up a show of activity, and when, on the evening of January
8, he sent Knowlton on a marauding scout into Charlestown, there
was a little flutter of excitement in Boston for fear it foreboded more serious
work, and the British officers were hastily summoned to their posts from
the play-house, where they were diverting themselves,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>&mdash;the play on this
particular occasion being something they had planned, and called <i>The Boston
Blockade</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">As early as the middle of June, 1775, General Wooster, with some Connecticut
troops, had by invitation of Congress marched to the neighborhood
of New York, to be prepared for any demonstration from British ships
which might attempt to land troops, for the British naval power was and
continued to be supreme in the harbor till Washington occupied the city.</p>

<p>Before Clinton had left Boston, Washington, under Lee's urgency, had
decided to possess New York, and the plan, which was submitted to John
Adams, as representing the Congress, met with that gentleman's approval.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
Lee was accordingly sent into Connecticut to organize such a force as he
could for advancing on that city.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> He kept Washington informed of his
success in these preliminaries, and finally reached New York himself on
February 4,<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> and here he remained till it was ascertained that Clinton was
proceeding to the South, where he was instructed to follow that general
and confront him as best he could, as we shall presently see.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>The chief event of February, 1776, was the arrival of the cannon captured
at Ticonderoga, and the placing them in the siege batteries along the
American lines, for Washington had dispatched Knox to bring these much
needed cannon to him. John Adams records meeting them on their way
at Framingham, January 25;<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> and when the train of fifty pieces and other
munitions reached the lines, there was something less of anxiety than there
had been before.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> The army, however, was still deficient in small arms,
and Washington wrote urgently to the New York authorities for assistance
of that kind.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>By the first of March powder had been obtained in considerable quantities,
and Washington opened a bombardment from all parts of his lines,
which was deemed necessary to conceal a projected movement. During
the night of March 4-5, General Thomas, from the Roxbury lines,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> with
2,500 men, took possession of Dorchester Heights.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> It was moonlight, but
the men worked on without discovery, and by morning had thrown up a
cover. Both armies now laid plans for battle.</p>

<p>Howe determined to attack
the Heights by a front and flank assault. Washington reinforced Thomas,
and planned at the same time to move on Boston by boats across the back
bay. The British dropped down on transports to the Castle, but a long
storm delayed the projected movement. This so effectually gave the Americans
time to increase their defences that the British general saw that to
evacuate the town was the least of all likely evils. As he began to show
signs of such a movement, the Americans began to speculate upon their
significance. Heath, at least, was fearful that the appearances were only a
cloak to cover an intention to land suddenly somewhere between Cambridge
and Squantum.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> But the genuineness of Howe's intention gradually
became apparent, as, indeed, evacuation with him was a necessity, while
Admiral Shuldam also saw that his fleet, too, was immediately imperilled
from the newly raised works on Dorchester Heights. So Howe had scarce
an alternative but to give a tacit consent to a plan of the selectmen of Boston
for him to leave the town uninjured, if his troops were suffered to embark
undisturbed. Washington entered upon no formal agreement to that
end, but acquiesced silently as Howe had done.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> There was still some cannonading
as Washington pushed his batteries nearer Boston on the Dorchester
side, at Nook's Hill, teaching Howe the necessity of increased expedition.
By early light on the 17th of March it was discovered that Howe
had begun to embark his troops, and by nine o'clock the last boat had
pushed off, completing a roll, including seamen, fit for duty, of about 11,000
men, with about a thousand refugees.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> The Continentals were alert, and
their advanced guards promptly entered the British works on the several
sides. The enemy's ships fell down the harbor unmolested; but that night
they blew up Castle William, and the vessels gathered together in Nantasket
Roads. Here they remained for ten days, causing Washington not a
little anxiety; and he wrote to Quincy, at Braintree, to have all the roads
from the landings patrolled, lest the British should send spies into the
country.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> On the 27th, all but a few armed vessels, intended to warn off

<p>Washington gradually moved his remaining
army to New York, not without apprehension at one time that he would
have to direct them to Rhode Island, for a fog had befooled some people in
Newport into sending him a message that the British fleet was in the offing
there. He left Cambridge himself April 4th, not for Virginia, as some
good people imagined he would do, out of loyalty to his province,<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> but to
defend as he could the line of the Hudson, of which signs were already
accumulating that it was the game for each side to secure. A few of the
enemy's ships still hung about Nantasket Roads, and some desultory fighting
occurred in the harbor.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> The British, however, failed to prevent some
important captures of munition vessels being made. It was not till June
that General Lincoln, with a militia force, brought guns to bear upon the
still lingering enemy, when they sailed away, and Boston was at last free of
a hostile force.</p>

<p>It is now necessary to follow two other movements, which had been begun
while the siege of Boston was in progress, the one to the north, and
the other to the south.</p>

<p>The exploits of Allen and Arnold at Ticonderoga, already related, had
invited further conquests; but the Continental Congress hesitated to take
any steps which might seem to carry war across the line till the Canadians
had the opportunity of casting in their lot with their neighbors. On
the 1st of June, 1775, Congress had distinctly avowed this purpose of restraint;
and they well needed to be cautious, for the Canadian French had
not forgotten the bitter aspersions on their religion which Congress had,
with little compunction, launched upon its professors, under the irritation
of the Quebec Act. Still their rulers were aliens, and the traditional
hatred of centuries between races is not easily kept in abeyance. Ethan
Allen was more eager to avail himself of this than Congress was to have
him; but the march of events converted the legislators, and the opportunity
which Allen grieved to see lost was not so easily regained when Congress
at last authorized the northern invasion. Arnold and Allen had each
aimed to secure the command of such an expedition, the one by appealing
to the Continental Congress, the other by representations to that of New
York. Allen had also gone in person to Philadelphia, and he and his Green
Mountain Boys were not without influence upon Congress, in their quaint
and somewhat rough ways, as their exuberant patriotism later made the
New York authorities forget their riotous opposition to the policy which
that province had been endeavoring to enforce in the New Hampshire
Grants. Connecticut had already sent forward troops to Ticonderoga to
hold that post till Congress should decide upon some definite action; and
at the end of June, 1775, orders reached Schuyler which he might readily
interpret as authorizing him, if the Canadians did not object, to advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
upon Canada.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> He soon started to assume command, but speedily found
matters unpromising. The Johnsons were arming the Indians up the Mohawk
and beyond in a way that boded no good, and they had entered into
compacts with the British commanders in Canada. Arnold had been at
Ticonderoga, and had quarrelled with Hinman, the commander of the Connecticut
troops. Schuyler heard much of the Green Mountain Boys, but he
only knew them as the lawless people of the Grants, and soon learned that
Allen and Warner had themselves set to quarrelling. Presently, however,
Allen reported at Ticonderoga for special service, as he had been cast off by
his own people. Another volunteer, Major John Brown, was sent by Schuyler
into Canada for information. Schuyler's position was a trying one. He
had few troops of his own province. The Connecticut troops were too lax
in discipline to suit his ideas of military propriety, and his temperament
had little to induce him to make concessions to the exigencies of the conditions.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
With the best heart he could, he tried to organize his force for an
advance, and assisted, in Indian conferences at Albany, to disarm, as far as
he might, the Mohawks of their hostility.</p>

<p>In August the news from Canada began to be alarming. Richard Montgomery,
an Irish officer who had some years before left the army to settle
on the Hudson and marry, was now one of the new brigadiers. He
urged Schuyler to advance and anticipate the movement now said to be
intended by Carleton, the English general commanding in Canada. At this
juncture Schuyler got word from Washington that a coöperating expedition
would be dispatched by way of the Kennebec, which, if everything went
well, might unite with Schuyler's before Quebec.</p>

<p>Montgomery had already started from Ticonderoga, and it was not till
the foot of Lake Champlain had been reached that Schuyler overtook him,
and, with an effective force of about 1,000 men, he now prepared, on the
6th of September, to advance upon St. Johns. The demonstration caused
a little bloodshed, but, getting information which deceived him, he fell back
to the Isle-aux-Noix, and prepared to hold it against a counter attack, and
to prevent any vessel of the enemy penetrating to the lake. The outlook
for a while was not auspicious. Malaria made sad inroads among the
men, and of those who were left on duty, insubordination and lack of discipline,
and perhaps a shade of treachery, impaired their efficiency. Schuyler
was prostrate on his bed, and Montgomery was forced to unmilitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
expedients because of the temper of his troops. Schuyler's disorder seeming
to have permanently mastered him, he resigned the command to Montgomery
and returned up the lake. He had, at least, the satisfaction of
meeting reinforcements pushing down to the main body. Before these
arrived Montgomery had begun the siege of St. Johns, and he was pressing
it, when Ethan Allen, whom Montgomery was expecting to join him, met
with Brown, and these two planned an attack on Montreal. It was attempted,
but Brown and his men failed to coöperate, and Allen and those
he had with him were finally captured.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> When the Canadians heard that
the redoubtable Green Mountain leader was in irons on board an English
vessel bound for Halifax,<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> a great deal was done towards awakening them
from that spell of neutrality upon which the American campaign so much
depended for success.</p>

<p>So Montgomery continued to keep his lines about St. Johns with great
discouragement. He met every embarrassment which a hastily improvised
and undisciplined mass of men could impose upon a man who was of high
spirit and knew what soldierly discipline ought to be. A gleam of hope at
last came. He detached a party to attack Fort Chamblée, further down
the Sorel, and it succeeded (October 18), and he was thus enabled to replenish
his store of ammunition, which was by this time running low.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> So
Montgomery was enabled to press the siege of St. Johns with renewed
vigor. When Wooster, the veteran Connecticut general, joined him with
the troops of that colony, there was some apprehension that the younger
Montgomery might find it difficult to maintain his higher rank against the
rather too independent spirit of the old fighter.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> No disturbance, however,
occurred, and both worked seemingly in union of spirit. Every effort of
Carleton to relieve the British commander at St. Johns failing, that officer
surrendered the post, and, on November 3d, Montgomery took possession.</p>

<p class="p2">We may turn now to the expedition that Washington had promised to
dispatch from Cambridge, and which had been thought of as early as May.
Benedict Arnold had hurried from Crown Point to lay his grievances before
the commander-in-chief. It seemed to Washington worth while to assuage
his passions and to profit by his dashing valor, for he had by this time become
convinced that Howe had no intention of venturing beyond his lines.
So Arnold was commissioned Colonel, and given command of the new
expedition, and the satisfied leader saw gathering about him various quick
spirits, better recognized later. Such was Morgan, who led some Virginia
riflemen, and Aaron Burr, who sprang to the occasion as a volunteer.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Washington provided Arnold with explicit instructions, and with an address
to circulate among the Canadians.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> About eleven hundred men proceeded
from Cambridge to Newburyport, whence, by vessel and bateaux, they
reached Fort Western (Augusta, Maine), towards the end of September.
Here the expeditionary force plunged into the wilderness, up the Kennebec,
environed with perils and the burdens of labor. Suffering and nerving
against vexations and weariness that grew worse as they went on, they saw
the sick and disheartened fall out, and found their rear companies deserting
for want of food.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Those that were steadfast were forced to eat moccasins
and anything. On they struggled to the ridge of land which marked the
summit of the water-shed between the Atlantic and the St. Lawrence.
Then began the descent of the Chaudière, perilous amid the rush of its
waters, which overturned their boats, and sent much of what stores they had
left on a headlong drive down the stream. At last the open country was
reached, and Arnold stopped to refresh the survivors. He dispatched Burr
to see if he could find Montgomery,<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> and, making the most of the friendly
assistance of the neighboring inhabitants, Arnold advanced to Point Levi,
and began to make preparations for crossing the St. Lawrence. The city
of Quebec looked across the basin in amazement on a stout little army, of
whose coming, however, they had had an intimation; while Arnold's men
were hard at work making or finding canoes and scaling-ladders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile where was Montgomery, whom Burr, disguised as a priest,
and speaking French or Latin as required, was seeking up the river? He
had got possession of Montreal without a blow, and sending Colonel Easton
down to the mouth of the Sorel, that officer intercepted the little flotilla
with which Carleton was trying to reach Quebec, and captured all of the
fugitives except Carleton himself, who escaped in a disguise by night. The
news of Arnold, which Burr at last brought to Montgomery, made that general
more anxious than ever to push on to Quebec, but the expiration of
the enlistments of some of his men much perplexed him, and he was
obliged to make many promises to hold his army together. Before Montgomery
could reach him, Arnold had in the night taken about 550 men
across the river, and ascending at Wolfe's Cove, he had paraded them before
the walls and demanded a surrender. The garrison was small, and in
part doubtful, and the inhabitants were more than doubtful, but the lieutenant-governor,
Cramahé, with his stanchest troops, the Royal Scotch, overawed
the rest, and kept the gates closed. The vaporing Arnold had been
known in the past within the town as a horse-jockey, and his promise as a
general, with his shivering crowd, did not greatly impress those whom he
had somewhat farcically beleaguered. In a day or two Arnold became
frightened and drew off his men, strengthened now a little by others who
had crossed the river. Unmolested he went up the river, to keep within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
reach of Montgomery, perceiving as he went up the banks the succor for
Quebec which Carleton, having picked up men here and there, was bringing
down by water.</p>

<p>By the 1st of December, Montgomery, with three
armed schooners and only 300 men, reached Arnold at Point-aux-Trembles.
The united forces now turned their faces towards Quebec, less than a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in all, with a body of two hundred Canadians, under Colonel James
Livingston, acting in conjunction; and on the 5th were before the town.
Carleton haughtily scorned all advances of Montgomery to communicate
with him, and devoted himself to overawing the town, quite content that
the rigors of winter should alone attack the invaders. While the Americans
were making some show of planting siege-batteries, plans for assault
were in reality maturing, and a stormy night was awaited to carry them out.
It came on the night before the last day of the year. While two feints
were to be made on the upper plain, the main assaults were to be along the
banks of the St. Charles and the St. Lawrence, from opposite sides, with a
view to joining and gaining the upper town from the lower. Montgomery
led the attack beneath Cape Diamond on the St. Lawrence side, and while
in advance with a small vanguard, and unsuspecting that his approach was
discovered, he was opened upon with grape, and fell, with others about
him.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> His death was the end of the assault on that side. Arnold was at
first successful in carrying the barriers opposed to him, but was soon severely
wounded and taken to the rear. Morgan, who succeeded to the
command, was pressing their advantage, when Carleton, relieved by Montgomery's
failure, and by the discovery that the other attacks meant nothing,
sent out a force, which so hemmed Morgan in, that, having already
learned of Montgomery's failure, he found it prudent to surrender with the
few hundred men still clinging to him. The Americans elsewhere in the
field hastily withdrew to their camp, and Carleton was too suspicious of
the townspeople to dare to take any further advantage of his success.</p>

<p>The command of the Americans now devolved on Lieutenant-Colonel
Donald Campbell, who sent an express to Wooster at Montreal, urging him
to come and take the control. That general thought it more prudent to
hold Montreal as a base,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> and remained where he was, while he forwarded
the dismal news to his superior, Schuyler, at Albany, who had quite enough
on his hands to overawe Sir John Johnson and the Tories up the Mohawk.
The succession of Wooster to the command in Canada boded no good to the
New York general, and led to such crimination and recrimination between
the two that Congress, towards spring (1776), took steps to relieve Schuyler
of the general charge of the campaign. Thomas, who had rendered
himself conspicuous in driving the British from Boston, was made a major-general
(March 6), and was ordered to take the active command in Canada.
A New England general for troops in the main from those colonies seemed
desirable, and Thomas was certainly the best of those furnished by Massachusetts
during the early days of the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Arnold, amid the snows, was audaciously seeming to keep up
the siege of Quebec in his little camp, three miles from the town. Small-pox
was beginning to make inroads on his little army, scarce at some periods
exceeding five hundred effective men. Wooster finally came from
Montreal on the first of April, and assumed command. For the influence
intended to soothe and gain the Canadians to pass from the courtly Montgomery
to the rigid and puritanical Wooster was a great loss, and it soon
became manifest in the growing hostility of the people of the neighboring
country. It was by such a pitiful force that Carleton allowed himself to
be shut up in Quebec for five months.</p>

<p>This was the condition of affairs when a commission, consisting of Benjamin
Franklin, Samuel Chase, and Charles Carroll, was sent by Congress,
with delegated powers, to act with prompter decision on the spot.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> They
reached Albany early in April, and found Thomas, from Boston, already
there. So the two generals, Schuyler and Thomas, pushed on ahead of the
commissioners, and, with the reinforcements now setting towards Canada,
before and behind them, it seemed as if a new vigor might be exerted upon
the so far disastrous Northern campaign. Thomas directed his course to
Quebec, while the commissioners went to Montreal, where they found the
most gloomy apprehensions existing, and were soon convinced that, without
hard money and troops, Canada must be relinquished. Franklin returned
to Philadelphia to impress this upon Congress, while Schuyler was
at his wits' ends to find men, provisions, and money to send forward, till
Congress should act.</p>

<p>Washington, by this time in New York with the troops which had forced
the evacuation of Boston, yielded to the orders of Congress, and sent Sullivan
of New Hampshire with a brigade, carrying money and provisions, to
reinforce the wretched army in Canada, thereby diminishing, with great
risk, his own force to less than 5,000 men. Thomas had at this time
reached Quebec (May 1), where he found, out of the 1,900 men constituting
the beleaguering army, only about a thousand not in hospital, and
scarcely five hundred of these were effective troops. It was necessary to
do something at once, for the breaking ice told the American general that
a passage was preparing for a British fleet, which was known to be below.
Plans for an assault on the town miscarried, and while Thomas was beginning
to remove his sick preparatory to a retreat, three British men-of-war
appeared in the basin. They landed troops, and gave Carleton an opportunity
to hang upon the rear of the retreating invaders, and pick up prisoners
and cannon. He did not pursue them far.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>Near the same time a force of British and Tories, coming down the river
from Ontario, had fallen upon Arnold's outpost at Cedar Rapids, above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Montreal, and had captured its garrison. Thus disaster struck both ends of
the American line of occupation. The force under Thomas was withdrawing
to the Sorel, when Burgoyne, with large reinforcements, landed at Quebec.
Up the Sorel the Americans retreated, joined now by the troops under
Thompson, which Washington had earlier sent from New York. Thomas<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
soon died (June 2) of small-pox at Chamblée; and Wooster being recalled,
Sullivan, who now met the army, took the command, and pushing forward
to the mouth of the Sorel, prepared to make a stand. He soon sent a force
under Thompson towards Three Rivers, to oppose the approaching British,
now reaching 13,000 in number, either at Quebec or advancing from it,&mdash;a
number to confront, of which apparently Sullivan had no conception.
This general himself possessed hardly more than 2,500 men, for Arnold,
instead of reinforcing him, as directed, had left Montreal for Chamblée.
The action at Three Rivers, of which the cannonading had been heard at
the Sorel, proved a disastrous defeat. It was followed by the British vessels
pushing up the river, and as soon as they came in sight Sullivan broke
camp and also retreated to Chamblée, followed languidly by Burgoyne.
Here Sullivan joined Arnold, and the united
fugitives, of whom a large part were weakened
by inoculation, continued the retreat to the Isle-aux-Noix,
thence on to Crown Point, where
early in July the poor fragmentary army found
a little rest,&mdash;five thousand in all, and of these
at least one half were in hospital.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

        <p class="pf200">From a plate in Valentine's <i>N. Y. City Manual</i>,
1851.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p2">We may glance now at the progress of events
to the southward. In Virginia, Dunmore, the
royal governor, hearing of Gage's proclamation
proscribing Hancock and Adams, feared that
he might be seized as a hostage, and took safety
on board a man-of-war in Yorktown harbor.
Events soon moved rapidly in that quarter.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
Patrick Henry, perhaps a little unadvisedly,
was made commander of their militia.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> In due time, from his floating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
capitol, Dunmore issued his proclamation granting freedom to slaves of
rebels,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> and had directed a motley crew of his adherents to destroy the
colonial stores at Suffolk, and this led to a brisk engagement at the Great
Bridge (December 9, 1775), not far from Norfolk, in which the royalists
were totally defeated.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> The destruction of that town, now under the guns
of the royal vessels, soon followed, on the first of January, 1776.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>On the 27th of February, 1776, the Scotch settlers of North Carolina,
instigated by Martin, the royal governor, and under the lead of their chief,
Macdonald,<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> endeavored to scatter a force of militia at Moore's Creek
Bridge, but were brought to bay, and compelled to surrender about half
of a force which had numbered fifteen or sixteen hundred.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p>Early in 1776 the task was assigned to Clinton, who had in January departed
from Boston, as we have seen, to force and hold the Southern colonies
to their allegiance, and Cornwallis, with troops, was sent over under
convoy of Sir Peter Parker's fleet, to give Clinton the army he needed.
The fleet did not reach North Carolina till May. In March, Lee, while in
New York, had wished to be ordered to the command in Canada, as "he
was the only general officer on the continent who could speak and think in
French." He was disappointed, and ordered farther south.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> By May he
was in Virginia, ridding the country of Tories, and trying to find out where
Parker intended to land.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> It was expected that Clinton would return north
to New York in season to operate with Howe, when he opened the campaign
there in the early summer, as that general expected to do, and the
interval for a diversion farther south was not long. Lee had now gone as
far as Charleston (S. C.), and taken command in that neighborhood, while
in charge of the little fort at the entrance of the harbor was William Moultrie,
upon whom Lee was inculcating the necessity of a slow and sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
fire,<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> in case it should prove that Parker's destination, as it might well be,
was to get a foothold in the Southern provinces, and break up the commerce
which fed the rebellion through that harbor.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid"><a name="c172" id="c172">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE earliest attempt with any precision to enumerate the various sources of information
upon the whole series of military events about Boston during 1775 and 1776
was by Richard Frothingham, in the notes of his <i>Siege of Boston</i> (1849), where, in an
appendix, he groups together the principal authorities. Later than this, Barry (<i>Massachusetts</i>,
iii. ch. 1), Dawson (<i>Battles</i>, vol. i.), and others had been full in footnotes; but
the next systematized list of sources was printed by Justin Winsor in 1875, in the <i>Bulletin</i>
of the Boston Public Library. This last enumeration was somewhat extended in the
<i>Bunker Hill Memorial</i>, published by the city of Boston,<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> and still more so by the same
writer in his <i>Handbook of the American Revolution</i>, Boston, 1879. It is condensed in
the <i>Memorial Hist. of Boston</i>, iii. 117.</p>

<p class="p2">Salem, because of a little alleged pricking of bayonets when Leslie's expedition was
harassed there in February, 1775, has sometimes claimed to have witnessed the first
shedding of blood in the war. The principal monograph on the subject is C. M. Endicott's
<i>Account of Leslie's retreat at the North Bridge in Salem, on Sunday, Feb. 26, 1775</i>
(Salem, 1856).<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> Early resistance to British arms, and even bloodshed in the act, had undoubtedly
occurred before the affair at Lexington, and writers have cited the mob at
Golden Hill,<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> in New York, and the massacre at Westminster, in the New Hampshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Grants, when an armed body of settlers arose against the authority of the king, as asserted
in favor of the jurisdiction of New York in March, 1775.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>The precipitation of warfare, however, can only be connected with the expedition to
Lexington and Concord. Every stage of the affair has been invested with interest by
discussion and illustration. The ride of Paul Revere to give warning has grown to be a
household tale in the spirited verse of Longfellow; but, as is the case with almost all of
that poet's treatments of historical episodes, he has paid little attention to exactness of
fact, and has wildly, and often without poetic necessity, turned the channels of events.
In literary treatment, the events of Lexington and Concord form so distinct a group of
references that they can be best considered in a later note (A), as can also the sources of
information respecting the fight at Bunker Hill (B).</p>

<p>Of the siege of Boston, the chief monograph is Frothingham's, already referred to.
Other contributions of a monographic nature are the address and chronicle of the siege
by Dr. George E. Ellis in the <i>Evacuation Memorial of the City of Boston</i> (1876); W. W.
Wheildon's <i>Siege and Evacuation of Boston and Charlestown</i> (Boston, 1876, pp. 64);
and the chapters on the siege in Dawson's <i>Battles of the United States</i>, vol. i., and Carrington's
<i>Battles of the Revolution</i> (1876).<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>Among the general historians, Bancroft has made an elaborate study of the siege, devoting
to it a large part of his vol. viii. (orig. edition), and all the histories of the United
States, Massachusetts, and Boston necessarily cover it.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>The principal of the later British historians is Mahon, in his <i>Hist. of England</i>, vol. vi.
Lecky (<i>England in the Eighteenth Century</i>, ii. ch. 12), while he goes little into details,
gives an admirable account of the two respective camps. <i>The Life of Burgoyne</i>, by Fonblanque,
is the fullest of the biographies of the actors on the British side.</p>

<p>On the American side, the lives of leading officers all necessarily yield to those of
Washington,<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> whose letters, as contained in vol. iii. of Sparks's ed. of his <i>Writings</i>, can
well be supplemented by those of Reed, then his secretary.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Of the contemporary general
historians, Gordon and Mercy Warren were familiar with the actors of the time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
The <i>Journals</i> of the Continental Congress and of the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts
follow the development of events, and show how in some ways the legislation shaped
them.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> Contemporary records and comments are garnered in Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>,
Force's <i>Archives</i>, Niles's <i>Principles and Acts of the Revolution</i>, and Moore's <i>Diary of the
Amer. Revolution</i>. The life and daily routine of both camps are to be traced in abundant
orderly books, diaries, and correspondence, of which the register is given in the
notes (C and D) following this essay.</p>

<p>Of the Canada expedition, in its combined movements by the Kennebec and Lake
Champlain, the authorities for detail may well be reserved for later notes (G and H), but
for comprehensive treatment references may be made to the general historians and a few
special monographs. As respects the campaign in general, the only considerable special
study is Charles Henry Jones's <i>History of the Campaign for the Conquest of Canada in</i>
1776 (Philad., 1882). The book does not profess, however, to follow the movements
before the death of Montgomery, nor to touch at all the coöperating column of Arnold
before it had united with the other. A principal interest of its writer is, furthermore, to
chronicle the share of Pennsylvanians in the campaign. The study is therefore but an
imperfect one, and the author gives the student no assistance in indicating his sources.
The reader most necessarily have recourse, then, for a survey of the whole campaign, to
such general works as Bancroft's <i>United States</i> (vol. viii.), Carrington's <i>Battles</i> (p. 122),
and other comprehensive and biographical works.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>The political aspects of the movement on Canada arise in the main from the mission of
the Commissioners of Congress to the army, and their efforts to affect the sympathies of
the Canadians. The sources of this matter are also traced in a subsequent note.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

reads <i>Old Landmarks and Historic Fields of Middlesex</i>,
Mr. Samuel Adams Drake follows (ch. xvi.-xviii.)
the route of the British troops from
Lechmere Point to Concord and back to Charlestown,
pointing out the localities of signal events

<p>The provincial congress ordered depositions<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
to be taken of those who had participated in the
events of the day, with a main purpose of establishing
that the British fired first at Lexington.
These were signed in several copies. One set
of them, accompanied by a request from Warren
to Franklin to have them printed and dispersed
in England, was entrusted to Capt. John
Derby, of Salem, who took also a copy of the
<i>Essex Gazette</i>, in which an account of the fighting
was printed, and sailed in a swift packet for
England four days after Lieutenant Nunn, bearing
Gage's despatches, had sailed from Boston
(April 24). Derby reached Southampton on the
27th of May, and was in London the next day.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
London had been stirred three weeks before with
rumors of a bloody day with Gage's troops,<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> and
now two days later the government felt called
upon to announce they had no tidings; whereupon
Arthur Lee, who, since Franklin had sailed
for America, had succeeded to his place as agent
of Massachusetts, and had received the papers,
made a counter-announcement that the public
could see the affidavits at the Mansion House.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>

<p>On the same
day the friends of America, forming the Constitutional
Society, met at the King's Arms in
Cornhill, and raised a subscription of £100, to
be paid to the widows and families of the provincials

they sighted, looking beyond the meeting-house (L), the Lexington militia, under Capt. John Parker, drawn
up along the farther side of the triangular green, in front of the houses of Daniel Harrington (E) and Jonathan
Harrington (D, still standing) (who was one of the killed), which were separated from each other by a
blacksmith's shop (G). The house on the opposite side of the common (F) was Nathan Munroe's (still standing),
and on the third side was Bucknam's Tavern (B, still standing), where Parker's company was mostly assembled
when the order was given to form on the common. When the minute-men scattered, most of them
ran across the swamp; but some fled up the Bedford road, in the direction of the Clarke House (A), still
standing, where Adams and Hancock had spent the night, but from which they were now hurrying towards
Burlington for better protection.</p>

<p class="pf400">On the return of the British from Concord, they met Percy's column on the road between Munroe's Tavern

of the wounded were carried into the tavern, which is still standing. The buildings (I J) were set on fire and
burned down. Balls from Percy's cannon have been dug up since in the town. One went through the meeting-house

from the neighboring towns reached them. Colonel Smith, the British commander, now sent out two parties
to seek for stores. One, which went by the road (4) to the South Bridge, found little. The other followed
the road (5) by the North Bridge, and passing beneath the provincials at 6, turned to their right, and took
the road (5) to Colonel Barrett's house, where they destroyed some cannon and other stores. This second
party had left a detail at the North Bridge to secure their retreat by that way, for the road (10) did not then
exist. The provincials, after the party bound to Colonel Barrett's passed on, descended from 6 to the North
Bridge, when the detail defending it, who were near 8, recrossed the bridge. Here the first firing took place,
and some were killed on both sides, the river being between the combatants. The British detail now retired
towards the centre of the town, the Americans following them across the bridge, but immediately dispersing
without military order. While thus scattered, the British party, returning from Barrett's house, recrossed the
North Bridge without molestation, and rejoined the main body at the centre of the town. Here the British,
after destroying other stores and delaying for about two hours, formed for the return march towards Lexington,
the main body following the road (2), while a flanking party took the ridge of high land (2).</p>

<p>A few days after the 19th, John Adams tells
us<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> he rode along "the scene of action toward
Lexington for many miles, and inquired of the
inhabitants the circumstances." He gives us no
particulars, but what he learned was not calculated
to diminish his ardor in the cause.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>The accounts on the British side are almost
equally numerous, including the official reports
of Gage, Percy, and Smith, already referred to.
General Gage sent (April 29)<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> to Gov. Trumbull,
of Connecticut, a statement, which was
printed at the time in a handbill as a <i>Circumstantial
Account</i>, and he refers to it "as taken
from gentlemen of indisputable honor and veracity,
who were eye-witnesses of all the transactions
of that day."<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1779 there was printed
at Boston a pamphlet containing General Gage's
instructions to Brown and De Bernière,<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> from a
MS. left in Boston by a British officer, to which
is appended an account of the "transactions" of
April 19, with a list of the killed, wounded, and
missing,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> and in 1775 there was printed at London
a contemporary summary in <i>The Rise, Progress,
and Present State of the Dispute</i>.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>The question of firing the first shot at Lexington
was studiously examined at the time, each
side claiming exemption from the charge of being
the aggressor, and Frothingham<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> and Hudson<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>
collate the evidence. It seems probable
that the British fired first, though by design or
accident a musket on the provincial side flashed
in the pan before the regulars fired.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> That some
irregular return of the British fire was made
seems undeniable, though at the time of the semi-centennial
celebration certain writers, anxious to
establish for Concord the credit of first forcibly
resisting the British arms, denied that claim on
the part of the neighboring town. The controversy
resulted in Elias Phinney's <i>Battle of Lexington</i>,
published in 1825,<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> with depositions of
survivors, taken in 1822; and Ezra Ripley's
<i>Fight at Concord</i>, published in 1827.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> The parts
borne by the men of other towns have had their
special commemorations.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><b>B.</b> <span class="smcap">Battle of Bunker Hill</span>, <i>June 17, 1775</i>.&mdash;There
are four sufficient authorities for tracing
all that is known respecting the battle of Bunker
Hill, even to minute particulars, especially with
respect to the testimony of those who, from nearness
to the event, or from opportunity, are best
entitled to be considered in the matter. The
earliest master of the literature and records of
the fight was Richard Frothingham, who through
life was identified with the story of Bunker Hill,
and who has on the whole, in his <i>Siege of Boston</i>
and in his <i>Life of Joseph Warren</i>, given us the
amplest details.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> His latest gleanings were included

<p>In June, 1868, Henry B. Dawson, in a special
number of the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, entered into
an elaborate collation of nearly all that had been
published up to that time, making his references
in footnotes, which serve as a bibliography of
the subject.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

           <p class="pf400">From the <i>Massachusetts Magazine</i> (Boston, 1794). Four views (12 X 18 inches, on copper) of different
aspects of the day's fight were drawn by Earl, a portrait painter, and engraved by Amos Doolittle shortly
afterward. They are reproduced in the centennial edition of Jonas Clark's <i>Narrative</i>; in Frank Moore's <i>Ballad
History</i>; in <i>Potter's American Monthly</i>, April, 1875; in <i>Antique views of y<sup>e</sup> Town of Boston</i>; and
separately, with an explanatory text, by E. G. Porter, as <i>Four Drawings of the Engagement at Lexington
and Concord</i> (Boston, 1883). The view of the attack on Lexington Green was drawn from Daniel Harrington's
house (see plan), and was reduced by Doolittle himself for Barber's <i>History of New Haven</i>. (W. S.
Baker's <i>Amer. Engravers</i>, Philad., 1875, p. 45.) It has also been redrawn several times by others. See Lossing's
<i>Field-Book</i>, i. 421, 524; Hudson's <i>Lexington</i>, p. 183; the Centennial edition of Phinney, etc.</p>

<p class="pf400">Earl and Doolittle were soldiers of a New Haven company, which reached Cambridge a few days after the
fight.</p>

<p>In 1875 Justin Winsor published first in the

commentary on all printed matter respecting
the battle, grouping his notes by their
affinities; and this was enlarged in the <i>Celebration
of the Centennial Anniversary of the Battle</i>,
published by the city of Boston in 1875; and
still further augmented in a section of his <i>Handbook
of the American Revolution</i> (Boston, 1879).</p>

<p>In 1880 James F. Hunnewell, in his <i>Bibliography
of Charlestown and Bunker Hill</i> (Boston),
grouped everything alphabetically under such
main headings as monographs, maps and plans,
contemporary newspapers, American statements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
British accounts, French accounts, anniversaries.
His enumeration is more nearly exhaustive than
Mr. Winsor's, though this may still supplement
it in some particulars.</p>

<p class="p2">The earliest printed accounts which we have

<p>What may be called the official statements on
the American side were speedily placed before
the public, but, strange to say, neither of the two
officers who have been held to have directed the
conduct of the Americans vouched for any of
the early accounts. From Putnam we have
nothing. Prescott made no statement, which has
come down to us, earlier than in a letter addressed

of the battle's history has necessarily entailed
more or less of the controversial spirit in all
who have written upon it, but for thoroughness
of research and a fair discrimination combined,
the labors of Frothingham must be conceded to
be foremost. Dawson is elaborate, and he reveals
more than Frothingham the processes of
his collations, but his spirit is not so tempered
by discretion, and an air of flippant controversy
often pervades his narrative. Of the more recent
general historians it is only necessary to
mention Bancroft<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> and Carrington. The former
gave to it three chapters in his original edition,
in 1858, which, by a little condensation, make
a single one in his final revision, but without
material change.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> The account in Carrington<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>

of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The question of who commanded during the
day has been the subject of continued controversy,
arising from the too large claims of partisans.
Though there is much conflict of contemporary
evidence, it seems well established
that Col. William Prescott commanded at the
redoubt, and no one questioned his right. He
also sent out the party which in the beginning
protected his flank towards the Mystick; but
when Stark, with his New Hampshire men, came
up to strengthen that party, his authority seems
to have been generally recognized, and he held
the rail fence there as long as he could to cover
the retreat of Prescott's men from the redoubt.
Putnam, the ranking officer on the field, Warren
disclaiming all right to command, withdrew
men with entrenching tools from Prescott, and
planned to throw up earthworks on the higher
eminence, now known as Bunker Hill proper,
and near the end of the retreat he assumed a
general command, and directed the fortifying of
Prospect Hill. It is not apparent, then, that any
officer, previous to this last stage of the fight, can
be said to have had general command in all
parts of the field. The discussion of the claims
of Putnam and Prescott has resulted in a large
number of monographs, and has formed a particular
feature in many of the general accounts
of the battle, the mention of some of which has
for this reason been deferred till they could be
placed in the appended note.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

           <p class="pf400">After a copperplate by J. Norman in <i>An Impartial Hist. of the War in America</i> (Boston, 1781), vol. ii.
p. 210. The best known picture of Warren is a small canvas by Copley, belonging to Dr. John Collins Warren,
of Boston, which has been often engraved, and is given in mezzotint by H. W. Smith in Frothingham's
<i>Life of Warren</i>. The picture in Faneuil Hall is painted after this, and Thomas Illman has engraved that
copy. A larger canvas by Copley, painted not long before that artist left Boston for England, is owned
by Dr. Buckminster Brown, of Boston, and was engraved for the first time in the <i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>, iii. 60,
where will be found accounts of various contemporary prints and memorials of Warren (pp. 59, 61, 142, 143),
including his house at Roxbury, the manuscript of his Massacre Oration, etc. Cf. Frothingham's <i>Warren</i>,
p. 546; <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, Dec., 1857; Loring's <i>Hundred Boston Orators</i>, p. 67; Mrs. J. B. Brown's <i>Stories of
General Warren</i>; <i>Life of Dr. John Warren</i>; the <i>Warren Genealogy</i>; <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Sept., 1866.
The earliest eulogy was that by Perez Morton in 1776 (Loring's <i>Hundred Boston Orators</i>, 327; Niles's
<i>Principles and Acts</i>, 1876, p. 30), and the earliest memoir of any extent was that by A. H. Everett, in
Sparks's <i>Amer. Biography</i> (vol. x.). There are reminiscences in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, xii. 113,
234, which were based by Gen. William H. Sumner on some letters published by him in 1825 in the <i>Boston
Patriot</i>, when, as adjutant-general of the State, he arranged for the appearance of the Bunker Hill veterans
in the celebration of that year, and derived some reminiscences from them respecting Warren's appearance
and action during the fight. All other accounts of Warren, however, have been eclipsed by Frothingham's
<i>Life of Warren</i> (Boston, 1865). In the <i>Boston Medical and Surgical Journal</i> (June 17, 1875), Dr. John
Jeffries (son of the surgeon of the British army who saw Warren's body on the field) published a paper on
his death. Cf. also R. J. Speirr in Potter's <i>Amer. Monthly</i>, v. 571; Frothingham's <i>Warren</i>, pp. 519, 523;
Barry's <i>Massachusetts</i>, i. 37, and references.</p>

<p class="pf400">The grateful intentions expressed by the Massachusetts House of Representatives (April 4, 1776), by the
Continental Congress (April 8, 1777; Sept. 6, 1778; July 1, 1780,&mdash;see <i>Journals of Congress</i>), and by the
Congress of the United States (Jan. 30, 1846,&mdash;<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, ii. 337), have never been carried out.
Benedict Arnold manifested a special interest in the welfare of Warren's children (<i>N. E. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg.</i>, April, 1857, p. 122). The Freemasons erected a pillar to his memory on the battlefield in
1794, which disappeared when the present obelisk was begun in 1825. There is a view of the pillar in the
<i>Analectic Mag.</i>, March, 1818, and in Snow's <i>Boston</i>, 309. Cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiv. 65. A statue of
Warren, by Henry Dexter, was placed in a pavilion near the obelisk in 1857. Cf. G. W. Warren's <i>Hist. of
the Bunker Hill Monument Association</i>; Frothingham's <i>Warren</i>, p. 547.</p>

<p>Among the anniversary discourses upon the
battle, a few will bear reading. The earliest was
by Josiah Bartlett in 1794, published by B. Edes,
in Boston, the next year. Daniel Webster made
a famous address at the laying of the corner-stone
of the monument in 1825, which can be
found in his <i>Works</i>, i. 59. (Cf. <i>Analectic Mag.</i>, vol.
xi.; A. Levasseur's <i>Lafayette en Amérique</i>, Paris,
1829.) The same orator, at the completion of
the monument in 1843, embodied little of historical
interest in his Address. (<i>Works</i>, i. 89.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>) Alexander
H. Everett's <i>Address</i> in 1836 was subsequently
inwoven in his <i>Life of Warren</i>. The
Rev. George E. Ellis began his conspicuous labors
in this field in his discourse in 1841. Edward
Everett spoke in 1850 (<i>Orations</i>, etc., iii.
p. 3), and Gen. Charles Devens, at the Centennial
in 1875, delivered an oration, which was
published by the city of Boston. The most noteworthy
address since that time was that of Robert
C. Winthrop at the unveiling of the statue
of Colonel William Prescott, June 17, 1881.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>
This statue, of which an engraving will be found
in the <i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i> (iv. 410), stands near
the base of the monument.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p class="p2">We turn now to the accounts on the British
side. The orderly-books of General Howe are
preserved among Lord Dorchester's (Carleton's)
Papers in the Royal Institution, London.
Sparks made extracts from them, now in no. xlv.
of the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> in Harvard College library.
Extracts relating to the dispositions for the day
of the battle, and for subsequent days, are given
by Ellis (1843) p. 88.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Cf. <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>,
1885, p. 214. The more immediate English
notes and comments on the battle can be best
grouped in a note.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<p>During 1775 there were two English accounts,
aiming at something like historical perspective.
One of these was, very likely, by Edmund Burke,
and was in the <i>Annual Register</i> (p. 133, etc.).
The other was <i>An Impartial and Authentic Narrative
of the Battle fought on the 17th of June,
1775, between his Britannic Majesty's Troops and
the American Provincial Army on Bunker's Hill
near Charles Town in New England</i>. The author
was John Clark, a first lieutenant of marines.
He gives a speech of Howe to his men,
representing that it was delivered just as he advanced
to the attack, but this and much else in
the book are considered of doubtful authenticity.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>In 1780 there appeared in the <i>London Chronicle</i>
some letters by Israel Mauduit, which were
republished the same year as <i>Three letters to
Lord Viscount Howe: added, Remarks on the battle
of Bunker's Hill</i> (London, 1780), which in a
second edition (1781) reads additionally in the
title, <i>To which is added a comparative view of the
Conduct of Lord Cornwallis and General Howe</i>.
There was among the Chalmers' MSS. (Thorpe's
<i>Supplemental Catal.</i>, 1843, no. 660) a writing entitled
<i>Some particulars of the battle of Bunker's
Hill, the situation of the ground</i>, etc. (8 pp., 1784),
which Chalmers calls a "most curious paper in
the handwriting of Israel Mauduit, found among
his pamphlets, Jan. 23, 1789."</p>

<p>In 1784 William Carter's <i>Genuine Detail of
the Royal and American Armies</i> appeared in London.
Carter was a lieutenant in the Fortieth
Foot, and his book was seemingly reissued in
1785, with a new title-page. (Brinley, no. 1,789;
Stevens, <i>Bibl. Amer.</i>, 1885, nos. 80, 81; Harvard
Coll. lib., 6351.16.)</p>

           <p class="pf400"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This sketch of Bunker Hill Battle, made for Lord Rawdon, follows a tracing of the original belonging to Dr. Emmet of New York, furnished to me by Mr. Benson J. Lossing.
A finished drawing from this sketch is given in the <i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>, vol. iii. Cf. <i>Harper's Mag.</i> xlvii., p. 18. The spire in the foreground is that of the West Church,
which stood where Dr. Bartol's church, in Cambridge Street, Boston, now stands, showing that the sketcher was on Beacon hill, 138 feet above the water. The smoke from the frigate to
the right of the spire rises against the higher hill where Putnam endeavored to rally the retreating provincials. This hill is 110 feet above the water, and about one mile and a half distant
from the spectator. One hundred and thirty rods to the right of this summit is the crown of the lower or Breed's Hill, where the redoubt was, which is 62 feet above the sea. Dr.
Emmet secured this picture and another of the slope of the hill, taken after the battle, and showing the broken fences (<i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>, iii. 88), at the sale of the effects of the
Marquis of Hastings, who was a descendant of Lord Rawdon, then on Gage's staff (<i>Harper's Monthly Mag.</i>, 1875). The earliest engraved picture of the battle is one cut by Roman,
which was published the same year, and appeared also in Sept., 1775, on a reduced scale, in the <i>Pennsylvania Magazine</i>. It has been reproduced in Frothingham's <i>Centennial:
Battle of Bunker Hill</i> (1875), in Moore's <i>Ballad History</i>, and in other of the Centennial memorials. In 1781 a poem by George Cockings, <i>The American War</i> (London), had a somewhat
extraordinary picture, which has been reproduced in Gay's <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. 401, by S. A. Drake, and others. In 1786 Col. John Trumbull painted his well-known picture of
the battle, which has been often engraved. (Cf. Trumbull's <i>Autobiography</i>; <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, xv.; Tuckerman's <i>Book of the Artists</i>; <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, Nov., 1879.)
Trumbull claimed that the following figures in his picture were portraits: Warren, Putnam, Howe, Clinton, Small, and the two Pitcairns.</p>

<p class="pf400">In the <i>Mass. Magazine</i>, Sept., 1789, there is a view of Charlestown, showing Bunker's and Breed's hills, with their original contours. It is reproduced in <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 554,
with a note upon other early views. Frothingham (<i>Siege</i>, p. 121) gives one from an early manuscript which closely resembles the topography of the Rawdon sketch; and again (<i>Centennial</i>,
etc.) another which is in fact the perspective sketch of the town at the edge of Price's view of Boston (1743), converted into a panoramic picture (<i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>, ii. 329).</p>

<p class="pf400">The <i>Gentleman's Mag.</i>, Feb., 1790, has a view of Charlestown, with the tents of the British army on the hill, taken after the battle, and from Copp's Hill. It shows the wharves
and ruins of the town. (Cf. note in <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 88.)</p>

<p>The account of the loyalist Jones (<i>N. Y. during
the Rev.</i>, i. 52) has his usual twist of vision,
though he is severe on Gage for "taking the
bull by the horns" in making an attack in front.</p>

<p>The long list of general histories on the British
side, detailing the events of the battle, begins
with Murray's <i>Impartial Hist. of the War</i> (London,
1778; Newcastle, 1782), and is made up
during the rest of that century by the <i>Hist. of the
War</i> published at Dublin (1779-85); Hall's <i>Civil
War in America</i> (1780); <i>The Detail and Conduct
of the Amer. War</i> (1780); Andrews's <i>Hist.
of the War</i> (1785, vol. i. 301,&mdash;quoted at length
by Ryerson, <i>Loyalists</i>, i. 461); Stedman, <i>Hist.
Amer. War</i> (London, 1794, vol. i. 125). The
best of the later historians is Mahon (<i>Hist. of
England</i>, vi.), who was forced to admit, when
pressed upon the question, that the American
claims of victory, which he says they have always
held, appear only in the reports of later
British tourists (vol. vi., App. xxix.). Lecky, in
his brief account (<i>England in the Eighteenth
Century</i>, iii. 463), makes an intention of Gage to
fortify the Charlestown and not the Dorchester
heights the incentive to the American occupation
of the former. Edw. Bernard's <i>History of
England</i> (London) has a curious "View of the
Attack on Bunker's Hill, with the burning of
Charlestown."</p>

<p>Something confirmatory, rather than of original
value, can be gained from the histories of
various regiments which took part in the battle,
as detailed in the series of <i>Historical Records</i> of
such regiments.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The battle almost immediately found commemoration
in British ballads (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, ii. 58;
v. 251; Hale's <i>Hundred Years Ago</i>, p. 7), and
the slain were commemorated in elegiac verses,
as in M. M. Robinson's <i>To a young lady, on the
death of her brother, slain in the late engagement
at Boston</i> (London, 1776). The same year there
appeared at Philadelphia <i>The Battle of Bunker's
Hill, a dramatic piece in five acts, in heroic measure,
by a gentleman of Maryland</i>.</p>

<p>Its author is
said to be Hugh Henry Brackenridge, and the
frontispiece, "The Death of Warren", by Norman,
is held to be the earliest engraving in British
America by a native artist (Hunnewell, p. 13;
Brinley, no. 1,787; Sabin, ii. 7,184; xiv. 58,640).
In 1779 there was printed at Danvers, <i>America
Invincible, an heroic poem, in two books: a Battle
at Bunker Hill, by an officer of rank in the Continental
army</i> (Hunnewell, p. 13). In 1781 an
anonymous poem was published in London,
known later to be the production of George
Cockings, and called <i>The American War, in
which the names of the officers who have distinguished
themselves during the war are introduced</i>
(Brinley, no. 1,788; Hunnewell, p. 14). Of later
use of the battle in fiction, it is only necessary to
name Cooper's novel of <i>Lionel Lincoln</i> and O.
W. Holmes's <i>Grandmother's Story of Bunker
Hill Battle</i> (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1875, p. 33).</p>

<p class="p2">The chief enumerations which have been heretofore
made of the plans of the battle of Bunker
Hill are by Frothingham, in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i>, xiv. 53; by Hunnewell in his <i>Bibliog. of
Charlestown</i>, p. 17; and by Winsor in the <i>Mem.
Hist. of Boston</i>, iii. (introduction). The earliest
rude sketches are by Stiles in his diary (Dawson,
p. 393), and one formed by printer's rules in <i>Rivington's
Gazetteer</i>, Aug. 3, 1775 (Frothingham's
<i>Siege</i>, p. 397, and Dawson, p. 390). Montresor,
of the British engineers, very soon made a survey
of the field, and this was used by Lieutenant
Page in drawing a plan of the action, which he
carried to England with him when, on account of
wounds received while acting as an aid to Howe,
he was given leave of absence (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i>, June, 1875, p. 56). In the Faden collection
(nos. 25-30) of maps in the library of Congress
there are Page's rough and finished plans, drawn
before the British works on the hill were begun,
and also plans by Montresor and R. W., of the
Welsh Fusiliers. Page's plan, as engraved, was
issued in London in 1776, and called <i>A Plan of
the Action at Bunker's Hill</i>.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>Page's, however, was not the first engraved.
One "by an officer on the spot" was published
in London, Nov. 27, 1775, called <i>Plan of the battle
on Bunker's Hill. Fought on the 17th of June</i>,
which was issued as a broadside, with Burgoyne's
letter to Lord Stanley on the same sheet. The
central position of the Americans is called
"Warren's redoubt." This is reproduced in F.
Moore's <i>Ballad History of the Revolution</i>.</p>

<p>Another contemporary British plan&mdash;discovered
probably "in the baggage of a British officer",
after the royal troops left Boston in March,
1776, but not brought to light till forty years
later, when it was mentioned in a newspaper in
Wilkesbarre, Penn., as having been found in an
old drawer&mdash;was one made by Henry de Bernière,
of the Tenth Royal Infantry, on nearly the
same scale as Page's, but less accurately.</p>

<p>It was engraved in 1818 in the <i>Analectic Magazine</i>
(Philad., p. 150), and a fac-simile of that engraving
is annexed. The text accompanying it states
that its general accuracy had been vouched for
by Governor Brooks, General Dearborn, Dr. A.
Dexter, Deacon Thos. Miller, John Kettell, Dr.
Bartlett, the Hon. James Winthrop, and Mr.
[Judge] Prescott. General Dearborn and Deacon
Miller thought the rail fence too far in the
rear of the redoubt, having been really nearly in
the line of it. Judge Winthrop and Dr. Bartlett
thought the map in this particular correct.
There was the same division of belief regarding
the cannon behind the fence, Dearborn and Miller
believing there were none there, Brooks and
Winthrop holding the contrary. Other witnesses
represented to the editor of the <i>Magazine</i> that
there was no interval between the breastwork
and the fence, but that an imperfect line of defence
connected the redoubt with the Mystick
shore, as represented in Stedman's (Page's)
map.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Portfolio</i> (March, 1818) General Dearborn
criticised the plan (Dawson, p. 406), and,
using the same plate in his separate issue of his
comments, he imposed in red his ideas of the
position of the works, and this was in turn criticised
by Governor Brooks.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Mr. G. G. Smith
made a (plan) <i>Sketch of the Battle of Bunker Hill
by a British Officer</i> (Boston, 1843), which grew
out of the plan and the comments on it. Bernière's
plan was also used by Colonel Swett as
the basis of the one which he published in his
<i>History of the Battle of Bunker Hill</i> (1828, 1826,
1827), which has been frequently copied (Ellis,
Lossing, etc.). The latest attempt to map the
phases of the action critically is by Carrington
in his <i>Battles of the Revolution</i> (p. 112), who
gives an eclectic plan. Plans adopting the features
of earlier ones are in the English translation
of Botta's <i>War of Independence</i>, Grant's
<i>British Battles</i> (ii. 144). A plan of the present
condition of the ground, by Thomas W. Davis,
superposing the line of the American works, is
given in the Bunker Hill Monument Association's
<i>Proceedings</i> (1876). A map of Charlestown
in 1775 with a plan of the battle was prepared
and published in 1875 by James E. Stone.
A plan of the works as reconstructed by the
British, and deserted by them in March, 1776,
is given in Carter's <i>Genuine detail</i>, etc. (London,
1784), which is reproduced in Frothingham's
<i>Siege</i>, p. 330. Other MS. plans of their works
on both hills are in the Faden maps in the
library of Congress.</p>

<p>Before the war closed a plan was engraved by
Norman, a Boston engraver, which is the earliest
to appear near the scene itself. This was a <i>Plan
of the town of Boston with the attack on Bunker's

<p class="p1"><b>D.</b> <span class="smcap">The British Camp.</span>&mdash;The condition of
Boston during the siege must be learned from
various sources. The <i>Boston News-Letter</i> was
still published, but numbers of it are very scarce

continued to be published in the town.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
It was a convenient vehicle for the British generals,
and any morsel of news likely to be distasteful
to the patriots, like the intercepted correspondence
of Washington and John Adams,
was pretty sure to reach the American lines
through its columns. The correspondence of
the generals is preserved in the British Archives
and in the papers at the Royal Institution
(London), and occasionally some few letters,
like those of Percy in the Boston Public Library,
have been found elsewhere. It is charged that

from the stores of the town, so far as he could,
on a vessel put at his disposal. Howe's proclamation
in his favor is in fac-simile in the <i>Mem.

later captured by Manly (<i>Evacuation Memorial</i>,
166). Similar experience in trying to escape
with his merchandise was suffered by Jolley Allen,
as portrayed in his <i>Account of a part of his
sufferings and losses</i>, ed. by C. C. Smith, given
in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Feb., 1878, and separately.

<p class="p1"><b>F.</b> <span class="smcap">Maps of the Siege of Boston.</span>&mdash;Plans
of Boston and its neighborhood, including its
harbor, for the illustration of the siege of Boston,
are numerous, and the account of them
given in the <i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i> (iii., introd.)
is in the main followed in the present enumeration,
which divides them into those of American,
English, French, and German origin, and adheres
as far as possible to the order of publication in
each group.</p>

<p>The earliest American is the 1769 (or last)
edition of what is known as Price's edition of
Bonner's map of Boston, which had done service
since 1722 by successive changes in the
plate, this last issue showing Hancock's Wharf,
and "Esqr. Hancock's seat" on Beacon Street.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
This map sufficed for local use till the events of
1775 induced new interest in the topography,
when the earliest response came from Philadelphia,
where C. Lownes engraved <i>A new plan of
Boston Harbour from an actual survey</i>, for the
<i>Pennsylvania Magazine</i>. It presented a reminder
of the great event of the year in its "N. B.
Charlestown burnt, June 17, 1775, by the Regulars."
There is another <i>Draught of the Harbour
of Boston and the adjacent towns and roads</i>, a
manuscript, dated 1775, among the <i>Belknap Papers</i>,
i. 84, in the cabinet of the Mass. Hist. Society.
The same <i>Pennsylvania Magazine</i>, the
next month (July, 1775), gave as engraved by
Aitkins <i>A new and correct plan of the town of
Boston and Provincial Camp</i>. The town seems
to be taken from a plan which had appeared in
the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (London) the previous
January; but in one corner was added a
plan of the circumvallating lines of the besieging
army.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Later in the season two other plans
were made, showing the American lines, which
were not published, however, till long after.
One is given in Force's <i>American Archives</i>, 4th
series, vol. iii.,<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> and the other was made by Col.
John Trumbull, in Sept., 1775, which was published
in his <i>Autobiography</i> in 1841.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> Of about
the same time is another very small <i>Plan of Boston
and its environs</i>, showing the circumvallating
lines, which is in one corner of a large <i>Map of
the Seat of Civil War in America</i>, engraved by
B. Romans, and dedicated to Hancock. There
is also, in the library of the Mass. Hist. Society,
a rude plan of the harbor and vicinity, showing
the positions of the provincials, which are reckoned
at 20,000, while the royal forces are put at
8,000. I find no other American plan till Norman's,
in 1781, reproduced on another page; and
not another till <i>The Seat of the late War at Boston</i>
appeared in the <i>Universal Asylum and Columbian
Magazine</i>, July, 1789, p. 444, but this is
a rather scant map of the country as far inland
as Worcester. Gordon had the year before this
given a map in his <i>American Revolution</i> (London,
1788) based on English sources; but it has
been the foundation of most of the eclectic maps
since published in this country.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>In 1822 a Mr. Finch printed in <i>Silliman's
Journal</i> an account of the traces then remaining
of the earthworks of the siege, both American
and British.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> There is an enumeration of the
different sections of the lines, within and without
Boston, in the <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i> (vol. iii.
104).<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>The earliest English plan of this period is one
called <i>A plan of Boston and Charlestown from
a drawing made in 1771</i>, which occupies the margin
of a larger map, engraved for <i>The Town and
Country Magazine</i> in 1776, later to be mentioned.
The <i>Catalogue of the King's Maps</i> (British Museum)
shows a colored plan of Boston and vicinity
(1773) in the centre of a large sheet, with
marginal views (later to be described).</p>

<p>In 1774 a <i>Plan of the town of Boston</i> made
part of a <i>Chart of the Coast of New England</i>,
which appeared in the <i>London Magazine</i>, April,
1774, and in <i>The American Atlas</i>, issued by
Thomas Jefferys in London, in 1776. This map
seems to be the model of a <i>New and accurate
Plan of the town of Boston</i>, which is engraved
in the corner of <i>A Map of the most inhabited part
of New England, by Thomas Jefferys, Nov. 29,
1774</i>, usually also found in <i>The American Atlas</i>
(1776, nos. 15 and 16). This map is found with
the date 1755, even after changes of a later
date had been made in the plate.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> The original
map has also a marginal plan of Boston
harbor (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, September, 1864).</p>

<p>The earliest English map of 1775 is one which
appeared in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (January,
1775), though it is dated Feb. 1, 1775. It shows
the town and harbor.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<p>In the June number of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
is a "map of the country one hundred
miles round Boston, in order to show the situation
and march of the troops, as well provincial
as regulars, which are now within sight of each
other, and are hourly expected to engage."</p>

<p>In June, 1775, was also made a not very accurate
map of the town and its environs, which
was published in London, Aug. 28, to satisfy the
eagerness for a map of the region to which the
news of the battle of Bunker Hill had turned
all eyes. It is to be found in the first volume of
<i>Almon's Remembrancer</i>, and is reproduced herewith.
A few weeks after the fight at Charlestown
there was probably made in Boston the
MS. plan of <i>Boston and circumjacent Country</i>,
showing the present situation of the king's
troops and the rebel intrenchments. It is dated
July 25, 1775, and is owned by Dr. Charles
Deane.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>The largest chart which we have of Boston
harbor of this period is dated August 5, 1775,
and was the work of Samuel Holland, the surveyor-general
of the Northern colonies, who was
for some years employed on a coast survey.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> It
takes in Nahant, Nantasket, and Cambridge, and
was based principally on the surveys of George
Callendar (1769).<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> When Des Barres included
it in his <i>Atlantic Neptune</i> (part iii., no. 6, 1780-1783),
he marked in the besieging lines, and dated
it Dec. 1, 1781, and in this state Des Barres also
used it in his <i>Coast and Harbors of New England</i>.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>A map showing thirty miles round Boston,
and bearing date Aug. 14, 1775, is in the king's
library (British Museum), and is signed by M.
Armstrong. It has marginal statistical tables,
and in the upper right-hand corner is a plan of
the "action near Charlestown, 17 June, 1775."<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>
There is among the Force maps in the library of
Congress the MS. original of the map (sketched
herewith as <i>Boston and Charlestown</i>, 1775),
which is called <i>A Draught of the Towns of Boston
and Charlestown and the circumjacent country,
shewing the works thrown up by his Majesty's
Troops, and also those by the Rebels during the
campaign of 1775. N. B. The rebel entrenchments
are expressed as they appear from Beacon
Hill.</i></p>

<p>On August 28th the British town-major in
Boston, James Urquhart, licensed Henry Pelham
to make a <i>Plan of Boston with its environs</i>.
It was engraved in aquatints in London, on two
sheets, and not published till June 2, 1777. Dr.
Belknap, who was much troubled to find a correct
plan of the town for this period, thought
Pelham's was the best.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p>There are among the Faden MSS. in the
library of Congress two MS. maps. One is probably
the best plan of Boston itself of this period,
and the other the best of those of the vicinity.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
They represent the conditions of 1775, though
they were not engraved and published by William
Faden in London till Oct. 1, 1777, and Oct.
1, 1778, respectively. They are both, in the
main, after a survey by William Page, of the
British engineers. The first is called <i>A Plan of
the Town of Boston, with the Intrenchments, etc.,
of his Majesty's forces in 1775, from the observations
of Lieut. Page and from the plans of other
gentlemen</i>. It gives the peninsula only, with a
small portion of Charlestown, and was again
issued in Oct., 1778.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> The second is <i>Boston, its
environs and harbour, with the Rebels' works
raised against that town in 1775, from the observations
of Lieut. Page, and from the plans of
Capt. Montresor</i>. It includes Point Alderton,
Chelsea, Cambridge, and Dorchester, and there
is a copy in the library of the Mass. Hist. Society.</p>

           <p class="pf400">This is from Page's <i>Plan of the Town of Boston</i>, published in London in 1777, and is accompanied by
the following Key:&mdash;<i>a</i>, redoubt; <i>b</i>, block-house for cannon; <i>c</i>, six 24-pounders, 2 royals; <i>d</i>, four 9-pounders;

scene of skirmishes during the siege (<i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>, iii. 80; Heath's <i>Memoirs</i>). The narrowest part
of the neck was at the present Dover Street where it intersects Washington Street. The foundations of the
main works at this point were laid bare in digging a drain in March, 1860. The outer works were just within
Blackstone and Franklin squares. There are views of these lines in the Faden Collection in the library of
Congress, dated August, 1775, probably the original of the engraved views which accompany Des Barres' coast
survey, and of which there are reproductions in the <i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>, iii. 80. Cf. also Frothingham's
<i>Siege</i>, p. 315. The same Faden Collection has a pen-and-ink plan of the lines, dated Aug., 1775 (no. 37 of the
<i>Catal.</i>).</p>

<p class="pf400">During the summer of 1775, John Trumbull, then an aid to General Spencer, crawled up, under cover of
the tall grass, near enough to the British lines to sketch them; but a continuance of the hazardous exploit was
soon rendered unnecessary by the desertion of a British artilleryman, who brought with him a rude plan of the
entire work. So Trumbull says in his <i>Autobiography</i>, p. 22. Washington, on comparing this surreptitious
sketch with the deserter's plan, found them so nearly to correspond that Trumbull thinks his own future promotion
probably arose from it. Trumbull's sketch and the memorandum of the deserter "from the Welsh
fusileers" seem to have been the basis of a careful drawing of the British lines, prepared apparently at headquarters
in Cambridge, as it bears the handwriting of Washington's aid, Thomas Mifflin, an explanatory
table of the armament in the works. This found its way into that portion of the Papers of Arthur Lee
which went to the Amer. Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, and from it a reduced heliotype is given in the
<i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>, iii. p. 80. Washington sent a copy of the plan, nearly duplicate, to Congress, and this
is given in Force's <i>Amer. Archives</i>, 4th ser., i. p. 29, and is reproduced on a smaller scale in Wheildon's <i>Siege
and Evacuation of Boston</i>, p. 34. (Cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, April, 1879, p. 62.) There are two other
American drawings of the lines, of less importance. One is in the <i>Pennsylvania Magazine</i> for Aug., 1775,
and is called <i>An exact plan of Gen. Gage's lines on Boston Neck in America, July 31, 1775</i>. The other is
a small marginal view of <i>The Lines thrown up on Boston neck by the ministerial army</i>, making part of the
<i>Seat of the Civil War</i>, by Romans. A rude powder-horn plan is noted in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> (Nov.,
1881), xix. 103. One of the Faden MS. plans shows a proposed star redoubt at a point outside the lines.</p>

<p>In October, 1775, an "Engineer at Boston",
Lieut. Richard Williams, made and sent over to
England a plan showing the "redoubt taken
from the rebels by General Howe", the British
camp on the higher summit of Bunker Hill, together
with the American lines at Cambridge
and Roxbury. In London it was compared with
"several other curious drawings", from which
additions were made, when it was published by
Andrew Dury, March 12, 1776, as engraved by
Jno. Lodge for the late Mr. Jefferys, and called
<i>Plan of Boston and its environs, showing the true
situation of his Majesty's Army, and also those of
the rebels</i>.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> In the same month (Oct., 1775) a
<i>Plan of Boston</i>, with Charlestown marked as in
ruins, appeared in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (p.
464). Another <i>Map of Boston and Charlestown,
by an English officer present at Bunker Hill</i>, was
published in London, Nov. 25, 1775. The last
map made during the British occupation of Boston
was <i>An accurate map of the Country round
Boston in New England, published by A. Hamilton,
Jr., near St. John's Gate, Jan. 16, 1776</i>, appearing
in the <i>Town and Country Magazine</i>.
It measures 11-1/2 × 12-1/2 inches, and extends from
Plymouth to Ipswich, and inland to Groton and
Providence.</p>

<p>The evacuation of Boston in March, 1776, removed
the centre of interest elsewhere, but
there was for some time an apprehension of the
return of the British for a naval attack; and
while the Americans were fortifying the harbor,
the English were publishing in London several
maps of its configuration. The earliest was a
<i>Chart of Massachusetts Bay and Boston Harbour</i>,
published April 29, 1776. With the date changed
to Dec. 1, 1781, it was subsequently included
by Des Barres in the <i>Atlantic Neptune</i>, and in
the <i>Charts of the Coast and Harbors of New England</i>,
1781.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Another <i>Chart of Boston Bay</i>,
whose limits include Salem, Watertown, and
Scituate, following Holland's surveys, was published
Nov. 13, 1776, and later appeared, dated
Dec. 1, 1781, in the <i>Atlantic Neptune</i>, and in the
<i>Coast and Harbors of New England</i>. A chart of
the harbor, with soundings, was also included in
the <i>North American Pilot for New England</i>
(London, 1776), showing a solitary tree on the
peninsula marked "Ruins of Charlestown."
There was a second edition of the <i>Pilot</i> in 1800.
A small plan of the harbor is also in the margin
of Carrington Bowles's <i>Map of the seat of
war in New England</i> (London, 1776).</p>

<p>The first eclectic map was that published by
Gordon in his <i>Amer. Revolution</i> (London, 1788),
which he based on Pelham's map for the country,
and Page's for the harbor.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<p  class="p2">The French maps published in Paris were almost
always based on English sources. Such
were the <i>Carte de la baye de Baston</i> (no. 30), and
<i>Plan de la ville de Baston</i> (no. 31), in <i>Le Petit
Atlas maritime, vol. i., Amérique Septentrionale,
par le S. Bellin, 1764</i>. There are several other
French maps without date, but probably a little
antedating the outbreak of hostilities. Such are
a <i>Plan de la ville et du port de Boston</i>, published
by Lattré in Paris;<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> and a small map, <i>Plan de
la ville de Boston et ses environs</i>, engraved by B.
D. Bakker. An engraved map, without date, is
in the British Museum, called <i>Carte des environs
de Boston, capitale de la N<sup>lle</sup> Angleterre en Amérique</i>.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
It carries the coast from below Plymouth
to above the Merrimac. There is in the
Poore collection of maps in the Mass. State Archives
a <i>Carte de la baye de Baston</i> (marked
Tome i. no. 30).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The only dated map of this period is a <i>Carte
du porte et havre de Boston, par le Chevalier de
Beaurain</i> (Paris, 1776). The corner vignette
shows a soldier bearing a banner with a pine-tree.
Frothingham, who reëngraved this picture,
could find no earlier representation of the pine-tree
flag.</p>

<p>The English (1774) map of the "most inhabited
part of New England" was reproduced
"after the original by M. Le Rouge, 1777", under
the title of <i>La Nouvelle Angleterre en 4 feuilles</i>;
and it was again used in the <i>Atlas Ameriquain
Septentrional, à Paris, chez Le Rouge</i> (1778),
repeating the map of Boston, with names in
English and descriptions in French. Another
reproduction from the English appeared in the
<i>Carte particulière du Havre de Boston, reduite
de la carte anglaise de Des Barres par ordre
de M. de Sartine</i> (1780). It belongs to the <i>Neptune
Americo-Septentrional, publié par ordre du
Roi</i>.</p>

<p>There is among the Rochambeau maps (no.
14), in the library of Congress, a <i>Plan d'une
partie de la rade de Boston</i>, done in color, about
eight inches wide by sixteen high, showing the
forts and giving an elaborate key.</p>

<p class="p2">There is a curious map of Boston and its harbor,
with names in Latin, but apparently of German
make, <i>Ichnographia urbis Boston</i> and <i>Ichnographia
portus Bostoniensis</i>, which make part of
a larger map, perhaps the <i>Nova Anglia</i> of Homann
of Nuremberg. The <i>Geschichte der Kriege
in und ausser Europa</i>, published also at Nuremberg
in 1776 (erste theil) has a map of Boston.
Of the same date (1776), and belonging to the
<i>Geographische Belustigungen für Erläuterung
der neuesten Weltgeschichte</i> (Zweytes Stück),
published at Leipsic, is a <i>Carte von dem Hafen
und der Stadt Boston</i>, following the French map
of Beaurain even to reproducing the group with
the pine-tree banner. It embraces a circuit
about Boston of which the outer limits are Chelsea,
Cambridge, Dorchester, Long Island, Deer
Island, and Pulling Point.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>G.</b> <span class="smcap">The Capture of Ticonderoga, 1775.</span>&mdash;It
is in dispute who planned and who conducted
the capture of Ticonderoga. On Feb.
21, 1775, Col. John Brown had suggested it to
Warren (<i>Force's Archives</i>). Arnold made a statement
of the post's defenceless condition to the
Committee of Safety in Cambridge, April 30,
1775 (<i>Mass. Archives</i>, cxlvi. p. 30; <i>Amer. Bibliopolist</i>,
1873, p. 79). On the 2d of May he was
given a money credit and munitions, and on the
3d he was definitely instructed to organize his
party (<i>Mass. Archives</i>, cxlvi. p. 39). It is claimed
that some purpose of acting on the suggestion
of Brown prompted in part, at least, the Massachusetts
provincial congress to appoint early in
April a committee to proceed to Connecticut
and the other New England colonies. Whether
it was by their instigation, by certain movements
in Connecticut, or by the direct agency of Arnold
that the plan was formed, it is difficult to
say. It is also claimed that the plan grew out of
a conference with the Massachusetts delegates
to the Philadelphia Congress, when, on their
way, they stopped at Hartford and held a session
with Governor Trumbull and his council
(<i>Force's Archives</i>, ii. 507; Wells's <i>Sam. Adams</i>,
ii. 298). Bancroft and the Connecticut antiquaries
find the beginning rather in the impulses of
one Parsons, who had just returned from Massachusetts,
and had got from Benedict Arnold,
whom he met on the way, a statement of the
plunder to be obtained there, and, without any
formal consent of the governor and council, proceeded
in the organization of a committee in
Connecticut (Bancroft, orig. ed., vii. 338; final
revision, iv. 182). Official sanction was first
evoked when Massachusetts, a few days later,
commissioned Arnold (<i>Mass. Archives</i>, cxlvi.
130, 139; <i>American Bibliopolist</i>, 1873, p. 79;
<i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1844, p. 14). The Connecticut
antiquaries have mainly set forth the
claims of their colony for leadership of the affair
in the papers which constitute vol. i. (pp. 163-185)
of the <i>Conn. Hist. Soc. Collections</i>, in which
is the journal of Edward Mott,<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> the chairman of
the Connecticut committee, edited by J. H.
Trumbull.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>The part taken in the movement in Western
Massachusetts arose from confidence reposed in
Brown and others of Pittsfield, by the Connecticut
men who passed through that town on their
way to the New Hampshire Grants.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> Brown
had, during the previous winter, notified the
Massachusetts committee that Ticonderoga
would receive the attention of Ethan Allen and
Green Mountain boys as soon as the outbreak
came. The credit which attaches to this commander
is complicated by the relations which
Arnold bore to the final capture, and has in turn
given rise to controversy. The most comprehensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
examination of the question on the Vermont
side is L. E. Chittenden's Addresses before
the Vermont Historical Society, Oct., 1872 (published
at Rutland by the society), and at the unveiling
of Allen's statue at Burlington, July 4,
1873. We have Allen's own statements in his
<i>Narrative of his captivity, etc.</i><a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<p>Dawson thinks that the merit of originating
the active measures cannot be taken from Benedict
Arnold, and in his chapter (<i>Battles of the
United States</i>, i. ch. 2) on the subject traces minutely
the sources of each step in the progress
of events, and in his Appendix (p. 38) prints the
protest (May 10th, p. 38) of the Connecticut committee
against Arnold's interference and Arnold's
report (May 11th, p. 38) to the Massachusetts
Congress.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> There are some of the current reports

given in the <i>Amer. Bibliopolist</i> (1871, p. 491).

<p class="p1"><b>H.</b> <span class="smcap">The Canada Campaign, 1775-1776.</span>&mdash;Washington
in New York, June 25th, entrusted
to Schuyler the command in the North (Lossing's
<i>Schuyler</i>, i. 330; Jones's <i>N. Y. during the
Rev. War</i>, 58), and Congress issued (May 29,
1775) an address to the Canadians (<i>Journal of
Congress</i>; Pitkin's <i>United States</i>, i. App. 19).
In August it was reported that this address was
left at the door of every house in Canada.
Schuyler reached Ticonderoga July 18th (Lossing's
<i>Schuyler</i>, i. ch. 21; Palmer's <i>Lake Champlain</i>,
ch. 6; Irving's <i>Washington</i>, ii.), and
pushed on to the foot of Lake Champlain in
September (Lossing, i. ch. 23).</p>

<p>Among the early reports, inducing the project
of invading Canada, were the letters of Maj.
John Brown (Aug. 14, 1775) and Ethan Allen
(Sept. 14th) respecting the condition of the Canadians
(Sparks's <i>Corresp. of the Rev.</i>, i. 461,

War, with much detail of names, plan of Quebec and heights of Abraham, Montreal and isles of Montreal</i>
(27 x 19 inches). On Feb. 16, 1776, Sayer and Bennett published in London <i>A new map of the Province of
Quebec according to the royal proclamation of 7 Oct., 1763, from the French surveys, corrected with those
made after the war by Captain Carver and other officers in his majesty's service</i>. There was a French

<p class="pc1 mid">THE SENTIMENT OF INDEPENDENCE, ITS GROWTH AND
CONSUMMATION.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY GEORGE E. ELLIS, D. D., LL. D.,</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>President Mass. Hist. Society.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE assertion needs no qualification that the thirteen colonies would
not in the beginning have furnished delegates to a congress with the
avowed purpose of seeking a separation from the mother country; and we
may also affirm, that, with a possible forecast in the minds of some two or
three members, such a result was not apprehended. If any deceptive
methods&mdash;as was charged at the time&mdash;were engaged in turning a congress
avowedly called to secure a redress of grievances into an agency for
securing independence, they will appear in the sharp scrutiny with which
we may now study the inner history of the subject. And if an explanation
of the course of the Congress can be found, consistent with its perfect
sincerity, we must then seek to trace the influences alike of the new
light which came in upon the delegates, and of successive aggravating
measures of the British government, in substituting independence as its
object. Though it is certain that Samuel Adams, fretting under the hesitations
of Congress, had proposed to an ardent sympathizer that the four
New England colonies should act in that direction by themselves, his own
clear judgment would have satisfied him that that step would have been
futile unless the other colonies followed it. If there were but a single colony
from which no response could be drawn, the consequences would have
been obstructive. That different sections of the country should have furnished
leaders so in accord as Samuel Adams, Richard H. Lee, and Gadsden
was a most felicitous condition. A congress, then, composed of delegates
from all the colonies was the indispensable and the only practicable
method for working out the scheme of independence, and even such a congress
must avoid basing its action on local grievances. The reserve which
the delegates from Massachusetts found it politic to practise, in not obtruding
their special grievances, was well decided upon from the first, and
proved to be effective. That the circumstances required patience in such
men as the Adamses is abundantly evident from the frankness with which
they wrote outside of Congress of the temporizing and dilatoriness of what
went on in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no general assertion which comes nearer to the truth on this
subject than that, from the first colonization of America by the English, the
spirit of independence was latent here, and was in a steady process of natural
development. George Chalmers, with the opportunities of a clerk of
the Board of Trade, made an inquisitive private study of State Papers,
and reached the full conviction that the colonists from the start, not only
quietly assumed, but really aimed at an independence. He quotes abundant
warnings, and charges the successive crown officials here and at home
with culpable negligence in not acting on these warnings when they might
have done so.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> The pages of Chalmers confirm and illustrate the fact that
the colonists lived in the enjoyment of a more real autonomy, and a do-as-you-please
enfranchisement, than was shared by home subjects. There
went with this a sort of assumption, a bold conceit, a sturdy truculency,
which could be easily trained into defiance.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>Large allowance also must be made on account of the fact that the colonies
had mastered their most critical perils wholly from their own resources.
English benevolence in private individuals had generously fostered some
enterprises of learning and charity here. But government had left the
exiles to fight their own battles against the savages and the earliest French
enemies. Far back in colonial times Governor Winthrop records that, in
some emergent strait of the exiles, a suggestion was made of turning to
England for help. The suggestion was shrewdly put aside, lest, having
asked such aid, they might incur obligations.</p>

<p>It was of course admitted that the colonists had come under some form
of obligation to the home government during the exhausting campaigns of
the French and Indian wars. A question, however, soon came under debate,
as to what that obligation involved. Great Britain assumed that it
justified a demand upon the colonists for revenue. The colonists roused
themselves to repudiate any obligation to be enforced by the payment of a
tax imposed by a Parliament in which they had no representation. It was
just here that the latent spirit of independence led the colonists to examine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to the root their relations of allegiance, and, on the other hand, their natural
rights. The General Court of Massachusetts, in 1768, had admitted
"that his Majesty's high court of Parliament is the supreme legislative
power over the whole empire." It took less than ten years to bring it
about that Massachusetts either had not understood what it said,&mdash;at least,
had not meant to say exactly that,&mdash;or had come to think differently
about it.</p>

<p>In the Bill of Rights coming from the first Congress the committee say:
"In the course of their inquiry they find many infringements and violations
of rights, which they pass over for the present." These previous
impositions and disabilities came in, however, afterwards for their full share
of rhetoric and argument. As we trace the method in which the controversy
with government matured, we mark these stages of it. Objection
and forcible resistance found their first occasion when, at the close of the
French war, government devised the policy of the Stamp Act. The colonists
came to distinguish this as creating an <i>internal</i> tax, in contrast to the
previous <i>external</i> taxes, through the laws regulating commerce, to which
heretofore they had not objected. Vindicating their resistance to the new
internal tax, they came to find similar grievances in the former external
taxes. So they were teaching themselves first to define and then to assert
independence.</p>

<p>We have become accustomed to associate with the term Congress the
idea of a legally constituted organic body, with defined powers authoritatively
assigned to it, the exercise of which is binding on its constituents.
Our Continental congresses were of quite another sort, and had no authority
save what might be granted to the wisdom and practicability of the
measures they advised. Most certain it is that only a very small minority of
the people of the colonies were concerned in calling the early congresses.
As certain, also, is it that a very large preponderance of the people of all
classes were then strongly opposed to any violent measures, to sundering
ties of allegiance, or to seeking anything beyond a peaceful redress of grievances.
On the whole, while it must be admitted that Congress was generally
in advance of its constituency, it knew how to temporize and to give
intervals of pause in steadily working on to its ultimate declaration. "Natural
leaders" always start forth in such a cause, and they learn their skill
by practice.</p>

<p>When it became evident that, instead of any healing of the breach, the
whole activity of the Congress tended to widen it, a regret was expressed
in some quarters that, by the connivance and consent of the royal governors,
and through the regular legislative processes, a more legal and conservative
character had not been secured to this meeting of delegates,&mdash;as
if dangerous plotting might thereby have been averted. But the patriot
leaders of the movement were too well advised to look for any such official
coöperation. The very life of their scheme depended upon its wholly popular
conception. Nor could the consent of governors and formal assemblies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
have been won to it. The whole method of the steady strengthening of
the spirit of alienation from Great Britain was a working of popular feeling
in channels different from those of ordinary official direction and oversight.</p>

<p>It was but fair to assume that the objects of the first Congress would be
defined by the instructions furnished by those who sent or commissioned its
members. The delegates from New Hampshire were bid "to consult and
adopt such measures as may have the most likely tendency to extricate the
colonies from their present difficulties, to secure and perpetuate their
rights, liberties, and privileges, and to restore that peace, harmony, and mutual
confidence which once happily subsisted between the parent country
and her colonies." Massachusetts bade her delegates "deliberate and determine
upon wise and proper measures, to be by them recommended to all
the colonies, for the recovery and establishment of their just rights and liberties,
civil and religious,<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> and the restoration of union and harmony between
Great Britain and the colonies, most ardently desired by all good men."
Rhode Island's charter governor empowered the delegates "to join in consulting
upon proper measures to obtain a repeal of the several acts of the
British Parliament, &amp;c., and upon proper measures to establish the rights
and liberties of the colonies upon a just and solid foundation." Connecticut
authorized its delegates "to consult and advise on proper measures for
advancing the best good of the colonies." The delegates from New York
were trusted without any particular instructions, having merely a general
commission "to attend the Congress at Philadelphia." So, also, New Jersey
appointed its delegates "to represent the colony of New Jersey in the
said General Congress." Pennsylvania sent a committee from its own
Assembly in behalf of the province "to consult upon the present unhappy
state of the colonies, and to form and adopt a plan for the purposes of obtaining
redress of American grievances, ascertaining American rights upon
the most solid and constitutional principles, and for establishing that union
and harmony between Great Britain and the colonies which is indispensably
necessary to the welfare and happiness of both." The deputies from
the three Lower Counties were "to consult and determine upon all such
prudent and lawful measures as may be judged most expedient for the
colonies immediately and unitedly to adopt, in order to obtain relief for an
oppressed people, and the redress of our general grievances."</p>

<p>It will be observed that the instructions from these eight colonies are
moderate and pacific in terms, without menace, or a looking to any other
results than harmony. Something a little more emphatic appears in what
follows. The Maryland delegates were to use all efforts in their power in
the Congress "to effect one general plan of conduct operating on the commercial
relations of the colonies with the mother country." Virginia bade
her delegates "consider of the most proper and effectual manner of so operating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
on the commercial connection of the colonies with the mother country
as to procure redress for the much-injured province of the Massachusetts
Bay; to secure British America from the ravage and ruin of arbitrary
taxes; and speedily to procure the return of that harmony and union so
beneficial to the whole nation, and no ardently desired by all British America."
The delegates of South Carolina are instructed "to concert, agree
to, and effectually prosecute such legal measures as shall be most likely to
obtain a repeal of the said acts and a redress of those grievances." The
deputies of North Carolina were authorized "to deliberate upon the present
state of British America, and to take such measures as they may deem
prudent to effect the purpose of describing with certainty the rights of
Americans, repairing the breach made in those rights, and for guarding
them for the future from any such violations done under the sanction of
public authority."</p>

<p>Now it is true that one may read as between the lines of these instructions
intimations of reserved purposes, and possibly menaces that something
more will be required if what is suggested in them fail of effect; but
as they stand, their tone is not hostile or menacing. They limit the terms
and measure of what they exact. Several very pregnant suggestions present
themselves. Men of a large variety of opinions and purposes might
take part in a congress so constituted. If the measures proposed had been
restricted, so to speak, to the programme, there might have been substantial
accord among the delegates, and no one could have been startled and
offended with what they soon regarded as rebellious manifestations in the
Congress.</p>

<p>The case of Joseph Galloway, at first esteemed a most resolute patriot,
and then committing himself to extreme loyalty, presents us an example.
He was a lawyer of great abilities, a gentleman of wealth and of high
social position. He had made many strong protests against the oppressive
measures of government. He was a member of the Pennsylvania Assembly
eighteen years, and twelve years its speaker. He says<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> that when he
was chosen as a delegate to the first Congress he positively refused to serve
unless he was allowed to draw his own "instructions." He was permitted
to do so, and he himself signed them as speaker. They contain this injunction:
"You are strictly charged to avoid everything indecent and disrespectful
to the mother state." Chosen a delegate to the second Congress,
he positively declined to serve, though importuned to do so by Dr. Franklin.
The instructions given to the eight associates named with him for this
second Congress contained the stringent words, "We strictly enjoin you
that you, in behalf of this colony, dissent from and utterly reject any propositions,
should such be made, that may cause or lead to a separation from
the mother country, or a change of the form of government." The removal
of this restriction on June 14, 1776, enabled a majority of the delegates to
give the vote of the province for independence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>No man in this first Congress marked a stronger contrast to Galloway
than Samuel Adams, the "man of the people." Compared with what
Joseph Reed called "the fine fellows from Virginia", Adams was not what
is conventionally called a gentleman; but while John Hancock brought
from Massachusetts money and ambition, his colleague carried the hardier
brains of the two. The odious epithet of "demagogue" attached to Adams,
not because of any beguiling arts, but from his plain simplicity of garb,
preferred associates, manners, and mode of life. In his cheap and homely
attire, dispensing with any other mode of influence than that of an honest
heart and a vigorous mind, he had made himself the familiar companion of
the mechanics, artificers, and craftsmen of North Boston, the shipbuilders,
joiners, and calkers,&mdash;the rough, honest, and thrifty democracy,&mdash;with
whom, sitting on a spar or loitering in a workshop, he would spend long
and instructive hours. He was puritanically religious and rigidly observant
of solemnities, prayed in his family, and asked a blessing at each meal of
his simple fare. He neglected his own business to devote himself to public
interests. Of his own poverty he was neither ashamed nor proud. It
would not have been seemly for him to have presented himself to the
courtly gentry of the Congress as he appeared in the streets of Boston. It
would doubtless have confirmed the prejudice which many entertained of
him as an ill-bred mass-leader. For deep and wide learning in legal, political,
and economical science, added to his college culture, and for debating
powers, he was the peer of any of his associates. If he had been left to
himself in his straits he would have gone on his high errand clad as he was;
but before he was to go his friends had done the best they could for him.
The tailor, the hatter, bootmaker, and haberdasher, appearing at his house
from anonymous friends, had furnished him a complete outfit, not, however,
of the full sumptuousness of Hancock's. As for the rest, Adams was well
prepared in bodily presence to meet for the first time his warm friend in
correspondence, Richard Henry Lee. No truly lineal citizen of the old
Puritan colony will ever be ashamed of this characteristic representative of
its traditions and its people at the first Congress,&mdash;this prophet of independence.</p>

<p>The fact, without any fulness of detail, is assured to us that there was
much of discordance and dissension in this Congress of 1774. Probably
there was scarcely a single proposition or speaker that did not find an antagonist.
Certainly it appeared that Congress was not ready to break from
the mother realm. Results, however, were reached of a sort to prompt
just such further measures from the British government as to insure some
livelier work in its next session. The most decisively contumacious act of
the Congress was the adoption and approval of the resolves passed by the
daring Suffolk County (Massachusetts) meeting, which most clearly endorsed
rebellion, and took steps in initiating it.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> It is to be remembered, moreover,
that in this first Congress, Washington, whose frank sincerity stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
unimpeached, denied that the colonies wished for, or could safely, separately
or together, set up for independence. Before Congress again met in
May, the first blood had been shed at Lexington and Concord; and Massachusetts,
as the first colony to set up as a consequence its own autonomy,
sought and received the ratification of its conduct by Congress, after it had
assembled.</p>

<p>The instructions to the delegates still held them to seeking a redress of
grievances and the restoration of harmony, as "desired by all good men",
and in pursuit of this object a second letter or petition to the king, which
John Adams calls "Dickinson's letter", was prepared and adopted by Congress.
It was respectful, earnest, tender in its professions and appeals. It
besought the king himself to interpose between his much-abused and long-enduring
subjects and the oppressive measures of his ministers, as if he
himself was misled and imposed upon by them. The bearing which this
most remarkable letter has upon the charge of insincerity and hypocrisy in
the action of Congress is apparent. It is enough to say here that Richard
Penn, the messenger who bore the letter, was not permitted to see the
king, whose only recognition of it was a violently toned proclamation for
suppressing rebellion and sedition among his American subjects. Startling
was the effect on the Congress of this royal declaration of an unrelenting
purpose, which arrived on November 1st, coupled with the intelligence
of a large reinforcement of the British army and navy, and with the
purposed employment of seventeen thousand German mercenaries. The
same day brought an account of the burning of Falmouth, now Portland,
by Captain Mowat, reasonably exciting an alarm in all the settlements on
the seaboard. What might be lacking in the final resolution of some of the
leading members of Congress to come to the issue was well supplied by
these last measures of government, which could work only in the direction
of an implacable rupture. Still it is a matter of fact, now attested by full
evidence, that the majority of Congress, either held by their lingering hope
of some scheme of conciliation, or even doubtful if their constituents would
reinforce their own resolution now, would not entertain a motion for independence.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
A recess of the Congress from August 5th to September 5th
gave to some of the members an opportunity to try the pulse of their constituents.
The king in his speech, October 26, 1775, reiterated his stern
purposes. It is noticeable that in the comments made upon it by speakers
in the opposition, the avowals of members in the Congress were confidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
quoted as repelling the charge that they were aiming for independence;
but General Conway said significantly, "They will undoubtedly prefer independence
to slavery."</p>

<p>The delegates of the thirteen colonies&mdash;Georgia being now represented&mdash;met
in Philadelphia, May 12, 1776, having now the whole bearings of
the struggle fully before them. The members had found their way to the
assurance that their professed loyalty to the constitution of the realm consisted
with, and might even require, a defiance of its monarch. There were
those who still held back. We note that personal alienations declared themselves
between members, starting from differences of opinion or strength of
resolve, as they faced the final question. Perhaps it is well that oblivion
has been allowed to settle over the attitudes and words of some of the actors
of the time, whether in or out of Congress. Gadsden, Lee, the Adamses,
and Patrick Henry were ready and eager for the boldest venture, supported
by Chase of Maryland, Ward of Rhode Island, Wolcott and Sherman of
Connecticut, and at last by Wyeth of Virginia. Wilson of Pennsylvania
held back. So did the strongly patriotic Dickinson, restrained by Quaker
influence. He was yet to be reassured, and his ballot was to be the decisive
one. Massachusetts should have been a unit; but Samuel Adams and
Hancock were alienated, and Paine and Cushing were not yet full-strung,
but the last-named was soon superseded by Gerry, who was in entire sympathy
with the Adamses. Congress recommended the colonies whose governors
had deserted their posts to set up governments of their own, if only
for a temporary purpose, till constitutional rule should be reëstablished.
Then, after an emphatic but calm restatement of grievances, and the failure
of all efforts to secure a redress, Congress engaged with the question
whether all the colonies might not be forced to set up such a government
of their own. The dastardly conduct of Lord Dunmore, governor of Virginia,
in following his own flight for refuge on board a frigate with a proclamation
to stir an insurrection among the slaves, might well have left it to
R. H. Lee, by direct instruction from his constituents, early in May, to
announce that on an appointed day he should move for a declaration of
independence. He did so on Thursday, the 7th of June. His motions were
for such a declaration, with a complete dissolution of all political connection
between the colonies and Great Britain; for the forming of foreign
alliances, and a plan of confederation. John Adams seconded the motions.
They were discussed on Saturday in a committee of the whole. On Monday,
after a long debate, Rutledge moved a postponement of the question
for three weeks. Up to this point Jefferson says that New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and South Carolina were not ready for the
decision, and thought it prudent to wait, though fast stiffening for the issue.</p>

<p>On June 10th Congress resolved that the consideration of Mr. Lee's first
proposed resolution&mdash;that declaring independence&mdash;be postponed to the
1st of July; but that no time should be lost in the interval, it appointed, on
June 11th, a committee to prepare such a declaration. This committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
was Jefferson, John Adams, Franklin, Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>
This postponement was in deference to the unreadiness of the delegates
of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and South
Carolina to take the decisive step. Some unnamed member had procured
the passage of a vote that on whichever side the majority should turn, the
decision should be pronounced unanimous, for or against the resolutions.
The vote of each colony was to count for one, whatever the number of its
delegates, the majority in each delegation pronouncing for its colony. The
debate was sharp and intensely earnest. The vote of Pennsylvania was
divided. Those of the six colonies just named being in opposition, there
was no decision. Two of the halting Pennsylvania delegates being induced
to absent themselves on the next day, fifty delegates being present, the
resolutions prevailed by a majority of one province.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> They had been bitterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
opposed by Livingston of New York, Dickinson and Wilson of Pennsylvania,
and Rutledge of South Carolina. Argument, persuasion, and appeal
were diligently pressed to draw the hesitating to acquiescence. Meanwhile
several of the colonies were anticipating the action of Congress in taking
their stand for independence: North Carolina, in April, 1776, and also Massachusetts,
at the same date; Virginia, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire,
and New Jersey followed; and New York, as we shall see, soon came
into line.</p>

<p>The proposed measures of Congress, associated with the leading one of
independence, were most sagaciously devised for dignifying the primary
resolve and elevating the action which should sustain it above the character
of a mere rebellion. Those measures assumed the rights and responsibilities
of nationality. The issuing of letters of marque and reprisal, the
making free of all the ports for commerce with all the world except Great
Britain, and the inviting of foreign alliances, were exercises of the prerogatives
of sovereignty, and were the reasons assigned by France for regarding
the United States as a nation at war with another nation. On July
12th Congress appointed a committee of one delegate from each colony
charged with reporting a plan of confederation, and another committee of
five to propose a plan for foreign alliances.</p>

<p>The Declaration marked a crisis alike in the forum and for the people.
It was read to Washington's army, and drew wild plaudits from officers
and from the ranks. As rapidly as panting couriers could disperse it over
the country it was formally received with parade and observance, and read
in town and village. It gave life and inspiration for every successive measure
to turn a purpose into an accomplished fact.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>Many of our writers, in tracing the working of the various opinions which
aided in fostering the spirit of independence, have found reason to ascribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
much influence to strong religious animosities, especially to hostility to the
state religion of England. It might perhaps be difficult to trace sharply
and directly through all the colonies any lines of division of this character
attributable to such an agency, as distinct and positive as those which manifested
themselves in secular affairs, but there can be no question that sectarian
influences had an important part in the animosities of the time. It
would have been but natural that in this matter the line between the loyal
and the disloyal should have been drawn between the English Church and
the dissenters, who were the vast majority of the colonists; but this rule
was by no means without many marked exceptions. All the Episcopal ministers
officiating in the colonies had received ordination in England. Their
oath bound them to loyalty. Most of them, too, in the northern provinces,
were pensioners of an English missionary society. The test applied to them
when the spirit of rebellion was strengthening was whether they would read
or omit in their services the prayers for the king. It stood little for them
to plead in their defence their oath and their dependence on a foreign fund.
Such a plea was a poor one, as being strictly personal and selfish, born of a
love of ease and of a cringing spirit. Some of them left their pulpits, and
maintained a discreet silence. Those who insisted upon fulfilling all the
pledges and duties of their office were in many cases roughly handled. It
is to be considered, however, that so far as sectarianism in religion would
alienate the colonies from Great Britain, it could not have been a prime
agent in the case, for then it would have alienated them from each other,
to which result it did not avail. The Tory refugee Judge Jones uses the
terms Presbyterians and Episcopalians as almost synonymous with the
terms rebels and loyalists. But this was by no means true.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> The leading
patriot John Jay, with many others from his province, was an Episcopalian.
The Episcopalians of Virginia, of Maryland, and of the Carolinas
were as stiffly opposed to the importation here of English prelates as were
the Congregationalists of New England. The Tory Galloway<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> traced our
rebellious spirit to the same source as that of the English civil war, viz.,
to Puritanism. He wrote: "The disaffection is confined to two sets of dissenters,
while the people of the Established Church, the Methodists, Lutherans,
German Calvinists, Quakers, Moravians, etc., are warmly attached to
the British government." Galloway exceeded the strict truth in that statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>The numbers, position, and experiences of Episcopal ministers in the
provinces at the period of the war have been recently presented in an
elaborate and well-authenticated monograph on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> From this
it appears that there were at the time not far from two hundred and fifty
clergymen, all of foreign ordination. The lack of Episcopal supervision
brought with it laxity of discipline. At the southward the church gathered
into it the wealthy, the officials of the government and of the army
and navy, professional men, and merchants. But their clergy, instead of
being, like their few brethren at the North, stipendiaries of a foreign society,
largely derived their support from those to whom they ministered,
and so, though being under the oath of allegiance, were more free to share
the patriotic sentiments of the laity, and they did so. Clergy and laity
in the Southern provinces seem, many of them, to have been as strongly
opposed, for temporary or other reasons, to the introduction of a foreign
prelacy as were those at the North. Several of the Episcopal clergy in the
Middle and Southern provinces proved themselves most ardent patriots,
not only in discourse but by taking chaplaincies in the Continental armies,
and even serving in the ranks and as officers in command. The trial test
for deciding their position was in the religious services required of them
on the days appointed by Congress for thanksgiving or fasting. Their
choice was not a free one between a full or a mutilated service of prayer.
The severest sufferers of this class were among the Episcopal ministers of
New York and Connecticut, who resolved to stand for loyalty. Some, however,
trimmed to time and necessity; others were patriots. Provoost, afterwards
the first Bishop of New York, espoused the side of the people.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>It was in New England that the "Puritanism" of which Galloway wrote
had the prevailing influence; and a very energetic and effective influence
it was, working with other agencies in making the English civil government
all the more odious because of the lordly prelates, who ruled not only
in church, but in state. The inherited and traditionary spirit of New England
had kept alive the memory of the ecclesiastical tyranny which had
developed Puritanism in Old England, and of the trials and sacrifices by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
which deliverance had been secured. Those very New England colonies
in which the rebellious spirit was most vigorous had been in but
recent years, by help alike of sympathizers and opponents, conservatives
of the old ways and reformers with the new, working their own way of
relief from their theocratic basis of government, and securing freedom
for themselves in belief and worship, with progress in the severance of
church and state. They could not patiently contemplate the establishment
of prelacy among them. Two occasions, operating as warnings, had freshened
the old Puritan spirit of New England just previous to the opening
of civil contention. One was the project, which had been zealously pressed,
of sending English bishops into the colonies, whose functions the popular
mind refused to distinguish between those which they exercised as lords,
both spiritual and temporal, in England and those of ordination and confirmation,
etc., which was all that was required of them as "superior clergy"
here. An animated pamphlet controversy had been waging on this subject
a decade before the outbreak of hostilities, in which appeared as a champion
on one side the bold and able minister Jonathan Mayhew of Boston,
and on the other, Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> No English prelate
ever had functions or presence on our territory. The other reason, for a
revival of the hostility here against the Established Church, was found in
the coming hither into the old Congregational parishes, and the maintenance
here by an English missionary society, of a number of Episcopal
ministers. It was charged&mdash;not, however, justly&mdash;that the benevolent
founders of that society had endowed it solely for the support of missionaries
to neglected and forlorn persons,&mdash;fishermen and others in the colonies,&mdash;whereas
it was used to promote division and disaffection in places
well provided with a ministry. This charge was overstrained, for no missionary
was sent to any place where there were not those, few or many,
who were actual members of the English Church, or who stood out against
the doctrine and discipline of Congregationalism. None the less did hostility
to the English Church help largely to stimulate the spirit of rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>The first provincial congress of Massachusetts, assembled in 1774, knew
very well the grounds of their reliance when by resolution they sent an
address to each and all of the ministers in the province, reminding them of
the valued aid and sympathy which their common ancestors in the years
of former trials had found in their religious guides, and earnestly appealing
for their help and strong efforts among their people in resistance of the
tyranny of the mother country. The New England ministers were not slow
in responding to&mdash;indeed, they had in many cases anticipated&mdash;this appeal
of their civil leaders. They had a marvellous skill for discerning the vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
relations between politics and religion, while they had a strong repugnance
to what was conveyed by the terms "church and state." With very few
exceptions,&mdash;such, however, there were, in rare cases, of pastors in years
and of timid spirits,&mdash;the ministers were foremost in inspiriting patriotism
and in meeting all the emergencies of the times.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p>The only organized and official measures taken by any one of the religious
denominations in sympathy with the American Revolution was that
of the Presbyterians, who had freed themselves from dependence on a civil
establishment. The Scotch-Irish Presbyterians on the frontiers of Virginia
and North Carolina had stoutly vindicated their religious rights against the
Established Church in Virginia, and were among the foremost in asserting
their independence of the mother country. With the sturdiest resolution
they had successfully triumphed over the Episcopal party in New York
and thwarted government influence in its behalf. John Witherspoon, the
only clergyman in the Congress of 1776, gave by delegated authority the
vote of the Presbyterians for independence.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<p>And now the question may well be asked, Where rests the chief responsibility
for bringing to this result the protracted controversy between the
mother realm and her colonies? The Declaration of Independence was
yet to be made good by a severe struggle on the part of the colonies, and
to be accepted by the other party in the issue. It is rarely, if indeed the
case has any historical parallel, when so large a measure of the responsibility
for bringing about a signal revolution in the great affairs of a nation
can, as in this instance, be directly charged upon an individual, and that
was his majesty George III.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> The facts of the case with their full evidence
stand now clearly certified. That Declaration, with the event which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
it signified, might have come in other ways. Agencies and events were
working to it. But that it came when it did, and as it did, he at whose
heavy cost it came was largely the conspicuous agent and cause of it.
That this is so, let the following tracing of the stages of the developments
attest. And by the charge here alleged is meant that the king was mainly
instrumental in bringing about the result, not merely by an official or representative
responsibility, nor by prerogative, but by the prompting of
personal feeling and private decision. It is also to be admitted that the
king may have been guided by the purest motives and the loftiest sense of
duty to preserve in any way the jewels of his crown and the integrity of his
empire. But none the less it was his will and resolve that decided the
issue.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the effect of every measure of the British government
brought to bear upon the colonies was directly the opposite of what had
been intended. Threats and penalties exasperated, but did not intimidate.
Seeming concessions and retractions did not conciliate. Contempt and defiance
called out corresponding and reciprocal feelings. There was a strict
parallelism between the ministerial inventions for securing the mastery and
the patriot ingenuity and earnestness for nullifying them. The few incidental
accompaniments of popular violence and mobs were so familiar to
the people of England at home as to count for little. They were to be
regretted and condemned, but they were fully offset by the indiscriminate
and vengeful punishments which government visited upon them.</p>

<p>We are to remember that the king, if not the originator and adviser
of all these measures, gave them his cordial approval. More and more,
as the quarrel ripened, his personal will and resolve asserted themselves,
even autocratically. When the catastrophe finally came, his prime minister
frankly confessed, that by the king's urgency, and in compliance with his
own view of the claims of loyalty, he had been acting against his own clear
judgment of what was wise and right, if not against his conscience.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> Who,
then, so much as the king, as sole arbiter, by his own personal decision,
substituted arms for debate? The colonies, no longer the aggressive party,
were put on the defensive. Still, even after this dropping of the royal gage
of battle, the Assembly of Pennsylvania, with its residuum of Quakerism,
required of its members the old oath of allegiance to George III., and Dickinson
reported to it strongly loyal instructions for its delegates. Is it strange
that Franklin refused to take his seat in that body? Two years later,&mdash;March
17, 1778,&mdash;the king writes to Lord North: "No consideration in
life shall make me stoop to opposition. Whilst any ten men in the kingdom
will stand by me, I will not give myself up into bondage. I will rather
risk my crown than do what I think personally disgraceful. It is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
that the nation should not stand by me. If they will not, they shall
have another king, for I will never put my hand to what will make me miserable
to the last hour of my life."<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> And again, when the end was at hand,
the king, writing to Lord North, March 7, 1780, says: "I can never suppose
this country so lost to all ideas of self-importance as to be willing to
grant American independence. If that word be ever universally adopted,
I shall despair of this country being preserved from a state of inferiority.
I hope never to see that day, for, however I am treated, I must love this
country."<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p>Recalling the fact that in all previous remonstrances<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> and petitions, without
a single exception, whether coming from a convention, an assembly, or
a congress, the ministry and Parliament were made to bear the burden of
all complaints and reproaches, we note with emphasis that in the Declaration
of Independence, for the first time, "the present king of Great Britain"
is charged as the offender. Its scathing invectives in its short sentences
begin with "He." His tools and supporters are all lost sight of, passed
unmentioned. This substitution of the monarch himself as chargeable,
through his own persistency, with the whole burden heretofore laid at
the door of his advisers indicates the necessity which Congress felt of
seeming to sever their plain constitutional allegiance to the monarch, and
of ignoring all dependence on his ministers or Parliament, whose supremacy
over the colonies they had always denied. Hence the tone and wording of
all the previous utterances of Congress, deferential and even fulsome as
they now seem, in sparing the king, for the first time, in the Declaration,
are changed to give the necessary legal emphasis of the capital letter in
<i>He</i>. Indeed, the law and the man were essentially as one, for the candid
monarch told John Adams, on his subsequent appearance as the minister
of the United States, that he was the last person in his realm to consent to
the independence of the colonies. The utter hopelessness of the measures
of government was obvious to the wiser statesmen of Britain and to those
whose observation was guided by simple common sense.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>A matter of sharp and reproachful criticism&mdash;which has not wholly disappeared
from more recent pages of history and comment&mdash;was found in
what certainly had the seeming of insincerity and duplicity in the earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
professions of loyalty made by leading patriots while the spirit of absolute
independence, latent and but thinly veiled, was instigating measures of
defiance, and even of open hostility. The patriots, it was boldly charged,
had practised a mean hypocrisy. The shock of the disclosure was at the
time sudden and severe. Joseph Galloway, though perhaps the most hostile
and vengeful, was by no means the least able or the most estranged
and disappointed of a class of very prominent men, who avowed that they
had been alienated from the patriot cause by the exposed duplicity of its
wiliest leaders. They had joined heart and hand in council and measures
with those who professed to be seeking only a redress of grievances, with
an unqualified loyalty as British subjects to the king and the constitution,
and in a disavowal of any idea of independence.</p>

<p>On the other side of the water, the Declaration, as "throwing off the
mask of hypocrisy" by the patriots, was a very painful shock to many
who had been most friendly and earnest champions of the cause of the colonists.
The members of the opposition in Parliament and in high places
were taunted by the supporters of government for all their pleading in
behalf of rebels. And when, besides the bold avowal of independence,
the added measures of a suspension of all commerce with Great Britain,
and of an alliance of the patriots with the hereditary enemy of their mother
country, came to the knowledge of those who had been our friends, the
consternation which it caused them was but natural. Manufacturers and
merchants, against whose interests so heavy a blow had been dealt, and all
Englishmen who scorned the French, our new ally, might with reason rank
themselves as now our enemies. Of course, the ministry and the abetters
of the most offensive measures of government availed themselves of the
evidence now offered of what they had maintained was the ultimate purpose
of the disaffected colonists, hypocritically concealed, and they confidently
looked for a well-nigh unanimous approval and support of the vengeful
hostilities at once entered upon. It was affirmed that the British officers
and soldiers here, who had before been but half-hearted and lukewarm in
fulfilling their errand, now became as earnest and impassioned in war measures
as if they were fighting Indians, Frenchmen, or Spaniards. Such
were really the effects wrought on both sides of the water, not merely by
the bold avowal of independence, but by what was viewed as the exposure
of a subtle and hypocritical concealment of the purpose of it under beguiling
professions of loyalty.</p>

<p>What is there to be said, either by way of explanation or of justification,
of the course ascribed to the patriots? It is well to admit freely that
there was much said, if not done, that had the seeming of duplicity and
insincerity, of secrecy of design and of sinuous dealing. And after yielding
all that can be charged of this, we may insist that, in reality, it was
nothing beyond the seeming. Neither disguise, nor duplicity, nor hypocrisy,
nor artful or cunning intrigue, in any shape or degree, was availed of
by the patriots. The result to which they were led was from the first natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and inevitable, and it was reached by bold and honest stages, in thinking
out and making sure of their way. The facts are all clearly revealed
to us in their course of development. The maturing of opinion, till what
had been repelled as a calamity was accepted as a necessity, is traceable
through the changing events of a few heavily burdened years, if not even
of months and days, to say nothing of the symptoms of it which a keen perception
may discover during the career of four generations of Englishmen
on this continent. Its own natural stages of growth were reached just at
the time that it was attempted to bring it under check by artificial restraint
of the home government. That government compelled the colonists to ask
themselves the two questions: first, if they were anything less than Englishmen;
and further, if their natural rights were any less than those of
men. There has been much discussion as to when and by whom the idea
of American independence was first entertained. It would be very difficult
to assign that conception to a date or to an individual. All that was natural
and spontaneous in the situation of the colonists would be suggestive
of it; all that was artificial, like the tokens of a foreign oversight in matters
of government, would be exceptional or strange to it. Husbandmen,
mechanics, and fishermen would not be likely to trouble themselves with
the ways in which their relations as British subjects interfered with their
free range in life. Larger and deeper thinkers, like Samuel Adams, would
feel their way down to comprehensive root questions, sure at last to reach
the fundamentals of the whole matter,&mdash;as, What has the British ministry
and Parliament to do with us? It required nine years to mature the puzzling
of a peasant over the question of a trifling tax into the conclusion of
a republican patriot statesman. Every stage of this process is traceable
in abounding public and private papers, with its advances and arrests, its
pauses and its quickenings, its misgivings and assurances, in all classes of
persons, and in its dimmest and its fullest phases. We have seen how it was
working its way in the honest secrecy of a few breasts in the first Congress,
even when repelled as a dreaded fatality. Samuel Adams is generally, and
with sufficient evidence, credited as having been the first of the leading
spirits of the revolt to have reached&mdash;at first in private confidence, steadily
strengthening into the frankest and boldest avowal&mdash;the conviction that
the issue opened between the colonies and the mother country logically,
necessarily, and inevitably must result in a complete severance of the tie
between them. Even at that stage of his earliest insight into the superficial
aspect of the controversy, when he is quoted as if hypocritically saying
one thing while he intended another, it will be observed that his strong
professions of loyalty are qualified by parenthetical suggestions of a possible
alternative. Thus, in the Address which he wrote for the Massachusetts
Assembly, in 1768, to the Lords of the Treasury, his explicit professions
of loyalty for his constituents close with the caveat that this loyalty will
conform itself to acquiescence so far as "consists with the fundamental
rules of the Constitution."<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> Of course, as the oppressive measures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
government exasperated the patriots, they were not only led on to discern
the full alternative before them, but were unreserved in their expressions
of a willingness to meet it, at whatever cost. Still, however, what seemed
like hesitation in the boldest was simply a waiting for the slow and timid
to summon resolution for decisive action. Of the single measures in Congress
preceding the Declaration of Independence, the most farcical and
the most likely to be regarded as hypocritical was the second petition to
the king, which his majesty spurned. His ministers had to compare with
its adulatory insincerities some intercepted letters of John Adams, written
nearly at the same time, stinging with defiance and treason. But John
Adams well described this petition to the king as "Dickinson's Letter."
Dickinson himself is the most conspicuous and true-hearted of the class of
men who to the last shrunk from the severance of the tie to the mother
country. Yet he was to be the one whose casting vote, by a substitute,
was to ratify the great Declaration. There may have been weakness in his
urgency that that petition should proffer a final hope of amity, but it was
the prompting of thorough manliness and honesty. As we have seen, it
was the royal scorn of that petition, backed by a wilful personal espousal
of responsibility, which made the king the real prompter of the Declaration
of Independence.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>Leaving out of view all obligations of the colonies to the mother country,
there was still quite another class of very reasonable apprehensions
which had a vast influence over the halting minds. What would be the
relations of the severed and possibly contentious colonies to each other,
with all their separate interests, rivalries, and jealousies? Might not anarchy
and civil war make them rue the day when, in rejecting the tempered
severity of the rule of a lawful monarch, they had forfeited the privilege
of having an arbiter and a common friend?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor was this the only dread. The Indians were still a formidable foe
on the frontiers. So far as they were held in check, it was largely by English
arms and influence. Without anticipating the cruel and disgraceful
complication of the trouble which was to come, and the aggravations of
civil war, by the enlistment of these savages by England as her allies
against her former subjects, it was enough for timid colonists looking into
the future to realize the power of mischief which lurked with these wild
men in the woods. Every further advance of the colonists beyond the
boundaries already secured would provoke new hostilities, and remind the
pioneers of the value to them of English armaments and reinforcements.
And yet once more, those were by no means bugbear alarms which foreboded
for the colonists, left to themselves, outrages from French and Spanish
intrigue, ambition, and greed of territory. France and Spain had losses
and insults to avenge against England, and might seek for reprisals on the
undefended colonists. It needs only an intimation, without detail, of the
apprehensions which either reason or imagination might conjure from this
foreboding, to show how powerfully it might operate with prudent men in
suspending their decision between rebellion and loyalty. All these considerations,
taken separately and together, whether as resulting in slow and
timid maturing of sentiment and of profession in Congress, or as influencing
the judgment of patriot leaders, or as guiding the vacillating course
of individuals and multitudes, may have given a seeming show of insincerity
and duplicity to words contrasted with subsequent deeds. But a clear
apprehension of all the alternatives which were then to be balanced will
satisfy us that there was little room for hypocrisy to fill.</p>

<p>Some show of reason for charging upon the patriots duplicity and lack
of downright frankness was found in their professions of a steadfast, but
still a qualified, loyalty. If there was not at first some confusion or vagueness
in their own ideas on this point, they certainly set themselves open
to such a misunderstanding by the ministry as to leave it in doubt whether
they knew their own minds or candidly declared them. The controversy,
from its beginning till its close, was constantly alleged to start from this
discriminating standard of loyalty: the colonists repudiated the exercise of
authority over them by Parliament and the ministry, and yet avowed themselves
faithful and loyal subjects of the king. The king could govern and
act only through Parliament. How could they repudiate the authority of
Parliament and respect that of the king? What was to be the basis, scope,
and mode of exercise of his authority? They certainly could not have in
view the exercise of an autocracy over them, the restoration of the old
royal prerogative which a previous glorious revolution had shattered. The
king could exercise his authority in the colonial assemblies only through
governors, and those governors had been rendered powerless here. Even
the sage and philosophic Franklin found himself perplexed on this point.
Writing from London to his son in New Jersey, March 13, 1768, he says:
"I know not what the Boston people mean; what is the subordination they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
acknowledge in their Assembly to Parliament, while they deny its power to
make laws for them?"<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Galloway pertinently asked of the first Congress,
"if they had any other union of the two countries more constitutional in
view, why did they not petition for it?" "The Congress, while they professed
themselves subjects, spoke in the language of allies, and were openly
acting the part of enemies."<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> How are we to reconcile two statements
made by Pitt in the same speech, in January, 1776: "This kingdom has no
right to lay a tax on the colonies." "At the same time, on every real point
of legislation, I believe the authority of Parliament to be fixed as the Polar
Star." Without any attempt to conceive or fashion a definition of their
ideal, the good common sense of the patriots at last worked out the conclusion
that their emancipation from the Parliament involved a dispensing with
the king.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p>There was no disguising the fact, however, that, with independence declared,
there was no such unanimity of purpose among all the members of
Congress, still less among their many-minded and vaguely-defined constituency.
It was inevitable, therefore, that both a degree of arbitrariness
towards halting and censorious objectors, and of harsh severity towards
open resistants, should henceforward characterize the measures approved
by the patriot leaders. There was a sagacious moderation and prudence in
the measures taken by Congress to conciliate and reassure the half-hearted
and the hesitating. For the final stand had been taken that nothing short
of an achieved independence should be accepted as the issue.</p>

<p>The prime movers in the patriot cause continued to be the main workers
for it, and gradually reinforced themselves by new and effective aiders.
Astute and able men, well read in history and by no means without knowledge
of international law and the methods of diplomacy, surveyed the field
before them, provided for contingencies, and found full scope for their wits
and wisdom. When we consider the distractions of the times, the overthrow
of all previous authority, the presence and threats of anarchy, the
lack of unanimity, and the number and virulence of discordant interests,
and, above all, that Congress had only advisory, hardly instructive, powers,
even with the most willing portion of its constituents, we can easily pardon
excesses and errors, and heartily yield our admiration to the noble qualities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and virtues of those who proved their claim to leadership. When we read
the original papers and the full biographies of these men, we are impressed
by the balance and force of their judgment, their power of expressing reasons
and convictions, their calm self-mastery, and the fervor of their purposes.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid"><a name="c252" id="c252">CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE source to which naturally we should first apply ourselves for the fullest information
on the development of the purpose of independence would be the <i>Journals of
Congress</i>. But our disappointment would be complete. The same reasons which enjoined
on the members secrecy as to the proceedings seem to have deprived the record even of
some things that were done and of almost every utterance in debate. We have to look to
other sources, the most scattered and fragmentary, to learn the names even of the principal
leaders in the debates, and from beginning to end we have not the report, scarcely a
summary, of a single speech. Our reasonable inference from such hints is that some ten,
or at most fifteen, members were the master-spirits in securing the adoption of measures,
while they were opposed by some as earnest as themselves, but not as numerous. But
whatever may have been written in the original <i>Journals</i> was subjected to a cautious
selection when they were printed by a committee. It is only from Jefferson himself, for
instance, that we learn (Randall's <i>Jefferson</i>, i. 15) how, somewhat to his chagrin, "the
rhetoric" of his draft of the Declaration was toned down. Especially do the <i>Journals</i>,
as printed, suppress all evidences of strong dissension, of which we have abundant hints
in fragments from John and Sam. Adams, Franklin, Dickinson, Galloway, Jefferson, Jay,
and Livingston. But the <i>Journals</i> do spread before us at length sundry admirable
papers, drawn by able and judicious committees.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>The reader must turn to the notes appended to chapter i. of the present volume for an
examination of some of the leading pamphlets occasioned by the Congresses of 1774 and
1775, and for an examination of their opposing views, with more or less warning of the
inevitable issue of independence.</p>

<p>One may easily trace in the writings of Franklin, extending through the years preceding
the Revolution, and through all the phases of the struggle, seeming inconsistencies
in the expression of his opinions and judgment. But these are readily explicable by
changes in time and circumstance. We must pause, however, upon the strong statement
made by Lecky in the following sentence: "It may be safely asserted that if Franklin
had been able to guide American opinion, it would never have ended in revolution."<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>Opportune in the date of its publication, as well as of mighty cogency in its tone and
substance, was that vigorous work by Thomas Paine, a pamphlet bearing the title "Common
Sense." If we take merely the average between the superlatively exalted tributes
paid to his work as the one supremely effective agency for bringing vast numbers of the
people of the colonies to front the issue of independence, and the most moderate judgments
which have estimated its real merit, we should leave to be assigned to it the credit
of being the most inspiriting of all the utterances and publications of the time for popular
effect. The opportuneness of the appearance of this remarkable essay consisted in
the fact that it came into the hands of multitudes, greedy to read it, a few months before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the burning question of independency was to be settled. The papers issued by Congress
might well answer the needs of the most intelligent classes of the people, in reconciling
them to the new phase of the struggle. But there were large numbers of persons who
needed the help of some short and easy argument, homely in style and quotable between
plain neighbors. And this eighteen-penny pamphlet met that necessity. It appeared
anonymously. John Adams says it was ascribed to his pen. Paine had been in confidential
intercourse with Franklin, and the sagacious judgment of that philosopher doubtless
suggested the form and substance of some of its contents, and may have kept out of
it some things less apt or wise. Washington, Franklin, and John Adams welcomed it as
a vigorous agency for persuading masses of simple and honest men that their rights must
now be taken into their own hands for vindication. The character of the writer alienated
from him the regard of those who could and who would willingly have advanced his interests,
and made him to multitudes an object of horror and contempt. Though his pamphlet
bore the title of "Common Sense", Gouverneur Morris says that that was a quality
which Paine himself wholly lacked. Posterity, however, may well accord to him as a
writer the high consideration given to him by his contemporaries, of having happily met
by his pen a crisis and a pause in the state of the popular mind. Franklin wrote that "the
pamphlet had prodigious effects."<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>Adam Smith's <i>Wealth of Nations</i> was published in the same year. Wise men have
often affirmed that if it had appeared a generation earlier, and if the doctrines and principles
which it advocated had passed into the minds of statesmen and economists, peaceful
rather than warlike measures would have disposed of the controversy. It required
the lapse of twoscore years to convince English statesmen and economists of the practical
wisdom of the leading principles advanced by this college professor. He maintained
the general viciousness and folly of the English colonial administration; that while even
the restricted commercial monopoly was more generous than the colonial rule of any other
governments, the prohibition of manufactures was mischievous and oppressive. He
agreed with Dean Tucker, that a peaceful separation of the colonies would benefit rather
than harm the mother country. Yet, under existing circumstances, such a separation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
impracticable, because neither the government nor the people of the realm would seriously
entertain the proposition.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>One of the best expositions of the views held by some of the Tory writers, that the
seeds of independency were sown with the early settlements and nurtured through their
history, is given in a tract by Galloway,<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> which was published in London in 1780, as <i>Historical
and Political Reflections on the Rise and Progress of the American Rebellion. In
which the Causes of that Rebellion are pointed out, and the Policy and Necessity of offering
to the Americans a System of Government founded in the Principles of the British
Constitution, are clearly demonstrated. By the Author of Letters to a Nobleman on the
Conduct of the American War</i>. He pleads that the rebellion has been encouraged by the
assertion "of the injustice and oppression of the present reign by a plan formed by the
administration for enslaving the colonies", and asserts that the mother country had fostered
the infancy and weakness of the colonies, had espoused their quarrels, and, at an
enormous cost of debt, had defended them. "The colonies are very rich and prosperous,
with more than a quarter of the population of Great Britain, and should share its burdens.
The rebellion did not spring from a dread of being enslaved." The writer then ably and
justly traces its origin to the principles of the Puritan exiles, from whose passion for
religious freedom has grown that for civil independence. He attributes much influence
helpful to rebellion to the organization among the Presbyterians at Philadelphia, in 1764,
which united by correspondence with the Congregationalists of New England. The other
sects were generally averse to measures of violent opposition to authority. The measures
of government are vindicated, and all trouble is traced to a faction in New England,
sympathized with and led on by a similar faction at home. The "Circular Letter", bringing
the colonies into accord, wrought the mischief. Two sharply divided parties at once
were formed, or proved to exist: the one defining and standing for the right of the colonies
with a redress of grievances, on the basis of a solid constitutional union with the
mother country, and opposed to sedition and all acts of violence; the other resolved by
all means, even though covert and fraudulent, to throw off allegiance, appeal to arms, run
the venture of anarchy, and assert, and if possible attain, independence. The latter
party, acting with some temporary reserve and caution, opposed all peaceable propositions,
and covertly worked for their own ends. They used most effectively a system of expresses
between Philadelphia and the other towns, Sam. Adams being the artful and diligent
fomenter of all this mischief. By his guile, Congress was brought to approve the Resolves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
of the Mass. Suffolk Conference, which declared "that no obedience is due to acts
of Parliament affecting Boston", and provided for an organization of the provincial militia
against government. He proceeded to argue that "the American faction", as in the fourth
resolve of their Bill of Rights, explicitly declare their colonial independence. This was
followed by an address to his majesty,&mdash;not calling it a petition,&mdash;and which the writer
proceeded to analyze with much acuteness, as being vague and evasive in its professions,
and suggestive of conditions which would prove satisfactory. Finally, "the mask was
thrown off", and the casting vote of the "timid and variable Mr. Dickinson" carried the
Declaration of Independence. "Samuel Adams, the great director of their councils, and
the most cautious, artful, and reserved man among them, did not hesitate, as soon as the
vote of independence had passed, to declare in all companies that he had labored upwards
of twenty years to accomplish the measure." Mr. Galloway closes with sharp strictures
upon the bewildered and vacillating policy which the government has heretofore pursued,
and pleads for a firm and generous "constitutional union" between the realm and the
colonies. The growth of the spirit of independence necessarily makes a part of all general
histories of the war, which are characterized in another place.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> claim of Chalmers that the passion for
independence had latently existed from the very
foundation of the New England colonies<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> had
been early denied by Dummer in his <i>Defence of
the N. E. Charters</i>. John Adams<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> had been outspoken
in his advocacy of independence for more
than a year before R. H. Lee introduced his resolution
into Congress. He had avowed it in letters,
which the British intercepted in July, 1775,
and printed in a Boston newspaper. If Josiah
Quincy, Jr. (<i>Memoirs</i>, 250, 341), can be believed,
he found Franklin in London in 1774 holding
ideas "extended on the broad scale of total emancipation"
(Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, i. 379). The resolves
of Mecklenburg County in North Carolina,
in May, 1775, were strongly indicative. John Jay
traced the beginning of an outspoken desire to
the rejection by the king of the petition of the
Congress of 1775 (<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>,
July, 1776). In the autumn of that year it is
certain that the passion for independence animated
the army round Boston (Frothingham's
<i>Siege of Boston</i>, 263), and in December James
Bowdoin was confident that the dispute must
end in independence (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xii.
228). There was very far from any general adhesion
to the belief in its inevitableness at all
times during 1775. Washington was not conscious
of the wish (Sparks, i. 131, ii. 401; Smyth,
ii. 457). Gov. Franklin was expressing to Dartmouth
the prevalence of a detestation of such
views (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiv 342). The
English historians have dwelt on this (Mahon,
vi. 92, 94; Lecky, iii. 414, 447, iv. 41).<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

        <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">AUTOGRAPHS OF THE MECKLENBURG COMMITTEE, MAY 31, 1775.</p>
           <p class="pf400">From the plate in W. D. Cooke's <i>Rev. Hist. of No. Carolina</i>, p. 64. Cf. Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 619,
for another fac-simile and accounts of the signers; also see C. L. Hunter, <i>Sketches of Western North Carolina</i>
(Raleigh, 1877, p. 39). It has been strenuously claimed and denied that, at a meeting of the people of
Mecklenburg County, in North Carolina, on May 20, 1775, resolutions were passed declaring their independence
of Great Britain. The facts in the case appear to be these:&mdash;On the 31st of May, 1775, the people of
this county did pass resolutions quite abreast of the public sentiment of that time, but not venturing on the
field of independency further than to say that these resolutions were to remain in force till Great Britain
resigned its pretensions. These resolutions were well written, attracted notice, and were copied into the leading
newspapers of the colonies, North and South, and can be found in various later works (Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>,
ii. 619, etc.). A copy of the <i>S. Carolina Gazette</i> containing them was sent by Governor Wright, of
Georgia, to Lord Dartmouth, and was found by Bancroft in the State Paper Office, while in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>
(no. lvi.) is the record of a copy sent to the home government by Governor Martin of North Carolina, with a
letter dated June 30, 1775. Of these resolutions there is no doubt (Frothingham's <i>Rise of the Republic</i>, p. 422).
In 1793, or earlier, some of the actors in the proceeding, apparently ignorant that the record of these resolutions
had been preserved in the newspapers, endeavored to supply them from memory, unconsciously intermingling
some of the phraseology of the Declaration of July 4th in Congress, which gave them the tone of a pronounced
independency. Probably through another dimness of memory they affixed the date of May 20, 1775, to them.
These were first printed in the <i>Raleigh Register</i>, April 30, 1819. They are found to resemble in some respects
the now known resolves of May 31st, as well as the national Declaration in a few phrases. In 1829 Martin
printed them, much altered, in his <i>North Carolina</i> (ii. 272), but it is not known where this copy came from.
In 1831 the State printed the text of the 1819 copy, and fortified it with recollections and certificates of persons
affirming that they were present when the resolutions were passed on the 20th: <i>The Declaration of Independence
by the Citizens of Mecklenburg County, N. C., on the twentieth day of May, 1775, with documents,
and proceedings of the Cumberland Association</i> (Raleigh, 1831). This report of the State Committee
is printed also in 4 Force, ii. 855. The resolves are reprinted in <i>Niles's Reg.</i> (1876, p. 313); in Caldwell's
<i>Greene</i>; in Lossing (ii. 622), and in other places. Frothingham says he has failed to find any contemporary
reference in manuscript or print to these May 20th resolutions. Jefferson (<i>Memoir and Corresp.</i>, iv. 322;
Randall's <i>Jefferson</i>, 1858, vol. iii. App. 2) denied their authenticity, and J. S. Jones supported their genuineness
in his <i>Defence of the Revolutionary History of North Carolina</i> (Boston, 1834). In 1847 Rev. Thomas
Smith, in his <i>True Origin and Source of the Mecklenburgh and National Declaration of Independence</i>,
agreed to the priority of the May 20th resolutions, but thought that both those and the national Declaration
were drawn in part from the ordinary covenants of the Scottish Presbyterians,&mdash;hence agreeing naturally in
some of their phraseology.</p>

<p class="pf400">The principal attempts to sustain the authenticity of the resolutions of May 20th are F. L. Hawks's lecture
in W. D. Cooke's <i>Revolutionary Hist. of North Carolina</i>, and W. A. Grahame's <i>Hist. Address on the Mecklenburg
Centennial at Charlotte, N. C.</i> (N. Y. 1875). The adverse view, held generally by students, is best
expressed in J. C. Welling's paper in the <i>No. Amer. Rev.</i>, April, 1874, and in H. B. Grigsby's <i>Discourse on
the Virginia Convention of 1776</i> (p. 21). John Adams was surprised on their production in 1819 (<i>Works</i>, x.
380-83). Cf. further in Moore's <i>North Carolina</i>, i. 187; <i>No. Carolina Univ. Mag.</i>, May, 1853; Bancroft's
<i>United States</i>, orig. ed., vii. 370, and final revision, iv. 196, and also in <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, xii. 378; Gay's <i>Pop. Hist.
U. S.</i>, iii. 474; Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 619; Johnson's <i>Traditions and Reminiscences of the Amer. Rev.
in the South</i> (Charleston, 1851, p. 76); <i>Amer. Hist. Rec.</i>, iii. 200; <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, July, 1882, p. 507;
<i>Southern Lit. Messenger</i>, v. 417, 748.</p>

<p class="pf400">The antedating of the Congressional Declaration of July 4, 1776, by local bodies, stirred beyond a wise prudence,
might well have happened in days when the air was full of such feelings; but they were of little effect,
except the Suffolk Resolves of Sept. 6, 1774, which were adopted by the Congress of 1774. Perhaps the earliest
of these ebullitions were some votes passed by the town of Mendon, in Massachusetts, in 1773 (<i>Amer.
Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, April, 1870). A fac-simile of the record is given in Gay's <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. 472.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in 1776 the passion for independence
gathered head. In March, Edmund Quincy
thought the feeling was universal in the Northern
colonies (<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1859,
p. 232). Francis Dana, just home from England,
was saying that he was satisfied no reconciliation
was possible (Sparks, <i>Corresp. of the
Rev.</i>, i. 177). The probability of independence
was recognized in the instructions which Congress
gave to Silas Deane in March, on his
sailing for Europe. In April came the violent
measure in Congress of abolishing the British
custom laws. The press was beginning to give
the warning note,<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> but not without an occasional
counter statement, as when the <i>N. Y. Gazette</i>
(April 8, 1776) asserted that Congress had never
lisped a desire for republicanism or independence.
Sam Adams was urgent (Wells, ii. 397).
John Adams was writing to Winthrop, of Cambridge,
to restrain him from urging Massachusetts
to break precipitately the union of the
colonies (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, xliv. 298), and
he was counselling Joseph Ward to be patient,
for it "required time to bring the colonies all
of one mind; but", he adds, "time will do it"
(<i>Scribner's Mag.</i>, xi. 572).</p>

<p>May was the decisive month, and events
marched rapidly. On the 1st, Massachusetts
set up a committee to conduct the government
of the province in the name of the people.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>
On the 4th the last Colonial Assembly of Rhode
Island renounced its allegiance (<i>Newport Hist.
Mag.</i>, Jan., 1884, p. 131). A letter of Gen. Lee
to Patrick Henry, on May 7th, has raised a
doubt of Henry's steadfastness (Force, 5th ser.,
i. 95), but Henry assisted in that vote of the
Virginia Convention, on the 15th, which instructed
its representatives in Congress to move
a vote of independence.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> R. H. Lee wrote to
Charles Lee that "the proprietary colonies do
certainly obstruct and perplex the American machine."<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>
Dickinson, as representing these proprietary
governments, saw something different
from independency in John Adams's motion of
May 15th, that "the several colonies do establish
governments of their own;" but when that
vote had passed, Adams and everybody else,
as he says, considered it was a practical throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
off of allegiance, and rendered the formal
declaration of July 4th simply necessary.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> Hawley
and Warren now wrote to Sam Adams, inquiring
why this hesitancy in declaring what
even now exists? (Wells, ii. 393); and Winthrop
urges the same question upon John Adams
(<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, xliv. 306).</p>

           <p class="pf400">After a painting in monochrome by Stuart, which was formerly at Monticello, and is now owned by Jefferson's
great-grandson, T. Jefferson Coolidge, of Boston. It was painted during Jefferson's presidency. An
engraving from a copy owned by Mrs. John W. Burke, of Alexandria, Va., is given in John C. Fremont's <i>Memoirs
of my Life</i>, vol. i. p. 12 (N. Y., 1887). A portrait of Jefferson, three quarters length, sitting, with
papers in his lap, was painted for John Adams by M. Brown, and is engraved in Bancroft's <i>United States</i>,
orig. ed., vol. viii. A picture by Neagle is engraved in Delaplaine's <i>Repository</i> (1835). The profile by Memin
is in Gay's <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. 484. There are various likenesses by Stuart: a full-face and a profile, owned by
T. Jefferson Coolidge, of Boston,&mdash;the profile is mentioned above, and the full-face is one of a series of the
Five Presidents, and it has been engraved in Higginson's <i>Larger History</i>; a full-length, belonging to the heirs
of Col. T. J. Randolph, of Edgehill, Va. (engraved in stipple by D. Edwin); and other pictures in the Capitol,
in the White House, at Bowdoin College, and in the possession of Edw. Coles, of Philadelphia (engraved by
J. B. Forrest). The picture engraved in Sanderson's <i>Signers</i>, vii., is a Stuart. A photogravure, made of the
one at Bowdoin College, is given in an account of the art collections there, issued by the college.</p>

<p class="pf400">Lossing, in a paper on "Monticello", Jefferson's home, in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, vol. vii., pictures some of the
memorials of Jefferson (cf. also <i>Scribner's Monthly</i>, v. 148), and adds views of the houses of other signers of
the Declaration. This is done also by Brotherhead in his <i>Book of the Signers</i>, together with rendering in fac-simile
autograph papers of each of them. Cf. J. E. Cooke on Jefferson in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, liii. p. 211; and
also "The Virginia Declaration of Independence, or a group of Virginia Statesmen", with various cuts, in
the <i>Mag. of Amer. History</i>, May, 1884, p. 369, giving portraits of Archibald Cary, Edmund Pendleton, Patrick
Henry, R. H. Lee, Geo. Mason, Thomas Nelson, Jr., Benj. Harrison, Edmund Randolph, James Madison,
with views also of Gunston Hall (Mason's home), Henry's house, Harrison's mansion of Berkeley, and of the
old Raleigh tavern, associated with the patriots' meetings.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As the debates
went on, reassuring notes came from New
England in respect to the Virginia resolutions.
Connecticut took action on June 14th (Hinman's
<i>Connecticut during the Rev.</i>, 94). Langdon
wrote from New Hampshire, June 26th,
that he knew of none who would oppose it
(<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, vi. 240). The vote of July 2d finished
the issue. Honest belief, intimidation, a
run for luck, and more or less of self-interest<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>
had made the colonies free on paper, and compelled
anew the conflict which was to make their
pretensions good.</p>

           <p class="pf400">This reproduces only the sentences near the beginning in the handwriting of Thomas Jefferson, showing
his corrections. Later in the manuscript there are corrections, of no great extent, in the handwriting of
John Adams and Benj. Franklin. The original paper is in the Patent Office at Washington, and is printed in
Jefferson's <i>Writings</i>, i. 26; in Randall's <i>Jefferson</i>; in the <i>Declaration of Independence</i> (Boston, 1876, published
by the city), where is also a reduced fac-simile of the engraved document as signed. Cf. Guizot's <i>Washington</i>,
Atlas. Lossing (<i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 281) gives a fac-simile of a paragraph nearly all of which was omitted
in the final draft, as was the paragraph respecting slavery (Jefferson's <i>Memoir and Corresp.</i>, i. p. 16). A letter
of Jefferson to R. H. Lee, July 8, 1776, accompanying the original draft, showing the changes made by
Congress, is in Lee's <i>Life of R. H. Lee</i>, i. 275. For accounts of various early drafts, and for John Adams's
instrumentality in correcting it, see C. F. Adams's <i>John Adams</i>, i. 233, ii. 515. Cf. also Parton's <i>Jefferson</i>,
ch. 21; and his <i>Franklin</i>, ii. 126. John Adams contended that the essence of it was in earlier tracts of Otis
and Sam. Adams (<i>Works</i>, ii. 514).</p>

<p class="pf400">On the literary character of the document, see Greene's <i>Historical View</i>, p. 382; the lives of Jefferson by
Tucker, Parton, Randall, John T. Morse, Jr. The similarity of the preamble of the Constitution of Virginia
and certain parts of the Declaration have been taken to show that Jefferson plagiarized (<i>New York Review</i>,
no. 1), but the testimony of a letter of George Wythe to Jefferson, July 27, 1776, seems to make it clear that
Jefferson was the writer of that part of the Constitution, though Geo. Mason formed the body of it. Cf. also
Wirt's <i>Patrick Henry</i> and Tucker's <i>Jefferson</i>.</p>

<p class="pf400">The text of the Declaration as Jefferson originally wrote it will be found in Randall's <i>Jefferson</i>, p. 172;
Niles's <i>Weekly Register</i>, July 3, 1813; Timothy Pickering's <i>Review of the Cunningham Correspondence</i>
(1824), the <i>Madison Papers</i>. These copies do not always agree, since different drafts were followed. It is
given, with changes indicated as made by Congress, in Jefferson's <i>Works</i>, i.; Russell's <i>Life and Times of
Fox</i>; Lee's <i>R. H. Lee</i>. John Adams (<i>Works</i>, ii. 511) gives the reasons why Jefferson was put at the head
of the committee for drafting the Declaration (<i>Potter's American Monthly</i>, vii. 191).</p>

orig. ed., viii. 349; Wells's <i>Sam. Adams</i>, ii. 413,
433; Randall's <i>Jefferson</i>, i. 182. Bancroft draws
John Adams's character with some vigor (viii.
309). Dickinson made the main speech against
Adams. Bancroft abridges it from Dickinson's
own report (viii. 452); Ramsay (i. 339) sketched
it. (Cf. Niles's <i>Principles</i>, 1876, p. 400, and <i>John
Adams's Works</i>, iii. 54.) Adams thought Dickinson's
printed speech very different from the
one delivered. Galloway, in his <i>Examination</i>
before Parliament, gave only the flying rumors
of what passed. The later writers summarize
the debates and proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

<p>There is some confusion in later days in the
memory of participants, by which the decision
for independence on July 2d is not kept quite
distinct from the formal expression of it on
July 4th. (Cf. McKean in <i>John Adams</i>, x. 88.)</p>

<p>It was the New York, and not the New Jersey,
delegates who were not instructed to vote
for the Declaration (Wells, i. 226). The position
of New York is explained by W. L. Stone
in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, July, 1883. The instructions
from Pennsylvania and Delaware came late.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;These four plates show the signatures of the signers (now very much faded in the original document),
arranged not as they signed, but in the order of States, beginning with Massachusetts and ending with
Georgia. The signatures were really attached in six columns, containing respectively 3, 7, 12 (John Hancock
heading this one), 12, 9, 13,&mdash;as is shown in a reduced fac-simile of the entire document as signed, given in
<i>The Declaration of Independence</i> (Boston,
1876). The signatures are also given
in Sanderson's <i>Signers</i>, vol. i.; in <i>Harper's

of a set of the autographs of the "Signers"
is, or rather has been, called the
test of successful collecting. The signatures
of Thomas Lynch, Jr., Button
Gwinnett, and Lyman Hall are said to
be the rarest. The Rev. Dr. Wm. B.
Sprague is said to have formed three
sets; but these collections, as well as
those of Raffles, of Liverpool, and Tefft,
of Savannah, have changed hands.</p>

<p>The finest is thought to belong to Dr. Thomas

Lewis J. Cist collection in N. Y., Oct.,
1886 (p. 47). It has been said that "of
the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of
Independence, nine were born in Massachusetts,
eight in Virginia, five in Maryland,
four in Connecticut, four in New
Jersey, four in Pennsylvania, four in
South Carolina, three in New York, three
in Delaware, two in Rhode Island, one
in Maine, three in Ireland, two in England,
two in Scotland, and one in Wales.
Twenty-one were attorneys, ten Merchants,
four physicians, three farmers,
one clergyman, one printer; sixteen were
men of fortune. Eight were graduates
of Harvard College, four of Yale, three
of New Jersey, two of Philadelphia, two
of William and Mary, three of Cambridge,
England, two of Edinburgh, and
one of St. Omers.</p>

<p>At the time of their
deaths, five were over ninety years of age,
seven between eighty and ninety, eleven
between seventy and eighty, twelve between
sixty and seventy, eleven between
fifty and sixty, seven between forty and
fifty; one died at the age of twenty-seven,
and the age of two is uncertain. At the
time of signing the Declaration, the average
of the members was forty-four years.
They lived to the average age of more
than sixty-five years and ten months.
The youngest member was Edward Rutledge,
of South Carolina, who was in his
twenty-seventh year. He lived to the
age of fifty-one. The next youngest
member was Thomas Lynch, of the same
State, who was also in his twenty-seventh
year. He was cast away at sea in the fall
of 1776. Benjamin Franklin was the
oldest member. He was in his seventy-first
year when he signed the Declaration.
He died in 1790, and survived sixteen of
his younger brethren. Stephen Hopkins, of Rhode Island, the next oldest member, was born in 1707, and
died in 1785. Charles Carroll attained the greatest age, dying in his ninety-sixth year. William Ellery, of
Rhode Island, died in his ninety-first year." The standard collected edition of their lives is a work usually
called Sanderson's <i>Biography
of the signers
of the declaration of
independence</i> (Philadelphia,
1820-27, in 9
vols.)</p>

<p>Vols. 1, 2 were edited
by John Sanderson; the
remainder by Robert
Waln, Jr. A list of the
authors of the different
biographies is given in
the <i>Massachusetts Historical
Society's Proceedings</i>,
xv. 393. There
was a second edition,
revised, improved, and
enlarged (Philadelphia,
1828, in 5 vols.). An
edition revised by Robert
T. Conrad was published
in Philadelphia in
1865.</p>

<p>An enumeration of
books which grew out of
Sanderson's <i>Signers</i> is
given in Foster's <i>Stephen
Hopkins</i>, ii. 183. Much
smaller books are Charles
A. Goodrich's <i>Lives of
the Signers</i> (New York,
1829), and there are other
collections of brief memoirs by L. C. Judson (1829) and Benson J. Lossing. Cf. also papers by Lossing in
<i>Harper's Mag.</i>, iii., vii., and xlviii., and his <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 868.</p>

<p>A fac-simile of the engrossed document as signed is given in <i>The Declaration of Independence</i> (Boston,
1876), and others are in Force's <i>Amer. Archives</i>, 5th ser., i. 1595; and one was published in N. Y. in 1865.
The earliest fac-simile is one engraved on copper by Peter Maverick, of which there are copies on vellum, as
well as on paper. It is called <i>Declaration of Independence, copied from the Original in the Department of
State and published, by Benjamin Owen Tyler, Professor of Penmanship. The publisher designed and
executed the ornamental writing and has been particular to copy the Facsimilies exact, and has also
observed the same punctuation, and copied every Capital as in the original</i> (Washington, 1818).</p>

           <p class="pf400"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The cut on this page is a reduction of a broadside issued in Boston, of which there is a
copy in the library of the Mass. Hist. Society, where there are copies of similar broadsides issued in Philadelphia
and Salem. The fac-simile given in Gay's <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i> (iii. 483) is of the Boston broadside without
the imprint at the bottom of the sheet. The first impression made for Congress was printed at Philadelphia
by John Dunlap, and the copy sent to Washington is in the library of the State Department. It was also later
printed in broadside at "Baltimore in Maryland, by Mary Katharine Goddard", and those of the copies which
I have seen, as attested by Hancock and Thomson in their own hands, in addition to the printed signatures,
and sent to the several States by order of Congress, Jan. 18, 1777, are of this Baltimore imprint. Such a copy
is in the <i>Mass. Archives</i>, cxlii. 23, together with the letter of Hancock transmitting it to that State. There
is another copy, similarly attested, in the Boston Public Library; and a reduced fac-simile of such a copy, with
its attestations, is given in the <i>Orderly-book of Sir John Johnson</i> (p. 220). It was generally, I think, inscribed
on the records of the several States, and I have seen it in the records of the towns in New England. (Cf. <i>N.
H. State Papers</i>, viii. 200.) It is copied as it appeared in the <i>Penna. Journal</i>, July 10th, in Moore's <i>Diary
of the Rev.</i>, i. 262; and in England it was reprinted in <i>Almon's Remembrancer</i>, iii. 258; <i>Annual Register</i>,
1776, p. 261; and in the <i>Gentleman's Mag.</i>, Aug., 1776.</p>

<p class="pf400">The earliest authorized reprint in any collection appeared at Philadelphia in 1781, in <i>The Constitutions of
the several States of America; The Declaration of Independence; The Articles of Confederation; The
Treaties between his most Christian Majesty and the United States of America. Published by order of
Congress</i> (Sabin, iv. 16,086, who says 200 copies were printed, and who gives various other early editions).
The Rev. William Jackson edited at London, in 1783, <i>The constitutions of the independent states of America;
the declaration of independence; and the articles of confederation. Added, the declaration of rights,
non-importation agreement, and petition of Congress to the King. With appendix, containing treaties.</i>
It can be found in Bancroft, viii. 467; H. W. Preston's <i>Documents illustrating American History</i>; Sherman's
<i>Governmental Hist. U. S.</i>, p. 615; Frothingham's <i>Rise of the Republic</i>, p. 539; and in very many
other collections and places.</p>

<p>McKean, in
1814, said it was not so,<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> and the best investigators
of our day are agreed that the president
and secretary alone signed it on that day, though
Lossing, following Jefferson, has held that,
though signed on that day on paper by the
members, it was in the nature of a temporary
authentication, and it did not preclude the more
formal act of signing it on parchment, which all
are agreed was done on August 2d following.
Thornton, of New Hampshire, signed as late as
Nov. 4th; and McKean, who was absent with
the army, seems to have temporarily returned so
as to sign later in the year. Thornton's name
appears in the printed <i>Journal</i> as attached to
the Declaration on July 4th, and McKean's is
not, though McKean was present and Thornton
was not. The fact is, the printed <i>Journal</i> is not
a copy of the record of that day, and was made
up without due regard to the sequence of proceedings,
when prepared by a committee for the
press in the early part of 1777. There is in
Force's <i>American Archives</i> (4th ser., vol. vi.
p. 1729) a journal constructed by combining the
original record (of which we have no printed
copy) and the minutes and documents of the official
files. From a collation of all these early
records it appears that the vote of January 18,
1777, ordering the Declaration to be printed
with the names attached,&mdash;then for the first time
done,&mdash;made it convenient to use this printed
record in making the published <i>Journal</i> entry
under July 4th. In this way the name of Thornton,
who signed it even subsequent to Aug. 2d,
appears in that printed record as having been
put to the Declaration on July 4th. That any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
paper copy was signed on July 4th is not believed,
from the fact that no such copy exists;
and if it be claimed that it has been lost, there
is still ground for holding rather that it never
existed, inasmuch as no vote is found for any
authentication except in the usual way, by Hancock
and Thomson, the president and secretary.
McKean's criticism was the first to confront
the usual public belief of its being signed
July 4th, as many respectable writers have maintained
since who preferred the authority of the
printed <i>Journal</i> and of Jefferson and Adams.
Such was Mahon's preference, and Peter Force
rather curtly criticised him for it, in the <i>National
Intelligencer</i>.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> Force did not explain at length
the grounds of his assertions, and Mahon did
not alter his statement in a later edition; but a
full explanation has been made by Mellen Chamberlain
in his <i>Authentication of the Declaration
of Independence</i> (Cambridge, 1885), which originally
made part of the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
Nov., 1884, p. 273. He gives full references.</p>

<p>The immediate effects of the Declaration in
America are traced in Frothingham's <i>Rise of the
Republic</i>, p. 548. "No one can read", says Wm.
B. Reed in his <i>Life of Joseph Reed</i> (i. p. 195),
"the private correspondence of the times without
being struck with the slight impression made
on either the army or the mass of the people by
the Declaration of Independence."</p>

<p>The Declaration was, of course, at once commented
on in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, in Almon's
<i>Remembrancer</i>, and in the other periodical
publications. Hutchinson's <i>Strictures</i> have been
mentioned. The ministry seem to have been
behind the <i>Answer to the Declaration of the American
Congress</i>, referred to in a preceding page,
which was ostensibly written by John Lind and
privately printed in London in 1776, but was
soon published without his name, appearing in
five different editions during the year, and was
the next year (1777) printed in French both in
London and La Haye. In the earlier edition
the outline of a counter declaration was included
(Sabin, x. 41,281-82). Lord Geo. Germaine is
also said to have had a hand in <i>The Rights of
Great Britain asserted against the claims of America</i>,
which passed through three editions at least,
the last with additions, during 1776, beside being
reprinted in Philadelphia (Hildeburn, no. 3,352).
Sir John Dalrymple and James Macpherson are
also thought to have some share in it.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> Lord
Camden's views are given in Campbell's <i>Lives
of the Chancellors</i> (v. 301). It soon became apparent
that the liberal party in England felt that
the Declaration showed the Americans determined
to act without their continued assistance
(Smyth's <i>Lectures</i>, ii. 439). Bancroft (ix. ch. 3)
traces the general effects in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>The appearance, Jan. 8, 1776, of the <i>Common
Sense</i>, written by Thomas Paine, a stay-maker
and sailor whom Franklin had accredited when
he came over in the summer of 1774, had produced
a sudden effect throughout the continent.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc400">JOHN HANCOCK. <span class="wn">(<i>The Scott picture.</i>)</span></p>
         <p class="pf400">Perkins (<i>Life and Works of Copley</i>, p. 70) notes three different likenesses of Hancock, painted by that
artist. The first represents him sitting at a table, which bears an open book, upon which his left hand lies,
while the right holds a pen. This picture, formerly in Faneuil Hall, is now in the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston. The Copley head has been engraved by I. B. Forrest and J. B. Longacre (<i>Sanderson's Signers</i>), and
there is a woodcut in the <i>Memorial Hist. of Boston</i>, iv. p. 5, and another engraving of it in W. H. Bartlett's
<i>United States</i>, p. 343. Cf. Gay's <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. 358. The German picture from the <i>Geschichte der
Kriege in und ausser Europa</i> (Neunter Theil, Nürnberg, 1777), of which a fac-simile is given herewith, is evidently
based on this picture, omitting the accessories. A similar picture, with supports of cannon at the lower
angles, is in Hilliard d'Auberteuil's <i>Essais</i>, i. p. 152. It seems to have been the likeness known on the continent
of Europe, and is perhaps the one referred to by John Adams, in writing to Spener, a Berlin bookseller,
when he says, "The portrait of Mr. Hancock has some resemblance in the dress and figure, but none at all in
the countenance" (<i>Works</i>, ix. 524). The immediate prototype of the German picture may have been a London
engraving, described in Smith's <i>British Mezzotint Portraits</i> as being in an oval, with a short wig and
tie at back, and professing to be painted by Littleford, and published Oct. 25, 1775, by C. Shepherd, which was
one of a series of American portraits published in London from 1775 to 1778, of which some, says that authority,
were reëngraved in Germany. The two other Copley pictures are described by Perkins as being owned
by Hancock's descendants: one an oval, showing him dressed in blue coat laced with gold; the other a miniature
on copper. There is in the Bostonian Society a photograph of a picture owned by C. L. Hancock. It
will be remembered that Hancock's widow married Capt. James Scott; and it is perhaps one of these Copley
pictures that is reproduced from an English print in J. C. Smith's <i>British Mezzotint Portraits</i>, p. 1321, and
shown in the present engraving (the Scott picture), of which the original, an oval, bears this inscription: "The
Hon<sup>ble</sup> John Hancock, Esq<sup>r</sup>, late Governor of Boston in North America, done from an original picture in the
possession of Capt. James Scott. Published by John Scott, No. 4, Middle Row, Holborn. Copley pinx<sup>t</sup>. W.
Smith, sculp." Smith also gives another print, which represents Hancock as standing, with the left hand in
his pocket, the other holding a letter addressed to "Mons. Monsieur Israel Putnam, major general à Long
Island." The face is much like the other.</p>

<p class="pf400">The Copley head seems also to have been used in the sitting figure, which appeared in the <i>Impartial History
of the War in America</i> (London, 1780, p. 207), of which a fac-simile is elsewhere given. The same picture
was reëngraved in even poorer manner in the Boston edition of the book with the same title (1781,
p. 346). Other contemporary engravings are found in the <i>European Magazine</i> (iv. p. 105); in the <i>Royal
American Magazine</i> (March, 1774, reproduced in fac-simile in the <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 46); and in Murray's
<i>Impartial History of the present War</i> (1778, vol. i. p. 144). Cf. Drake's <i>Tea Leaves</i>, p. 286.</p>

<p class="pf400">The character of Hancock had pettinesses that have served to lower his popular reputation, and this last is
well reflected in the drawing of his traits in Wells's <i>Sam. Adams</i> (ii. 381). John Adams, whose robustness of
character was quite at variance with that of his friend, was not blinded to sterling qualities in the rich man,
who gave an adherence to a cause that few of his position in Massachusetts did (<i>John Adams's Works</i>, x.
259, 284). Adams's grandson speaks of the biography of Hancock in Sanderson's <i>Signers</i> as a curious specimen
of unfavorable judgment in the guise of eulogy, and a sketch by this same grandson, C. F. Adams, is in
the <i>Penna. Mag. of Hist.</i>, p. 73, and a memoir by G. Mountfort in Hunt's <i>American Merchants</i>, vol. ii. The
accounts in Loring's <i>Hundred Boston Orators</i>, p. 72, and by Gen. W. H. Sumner in the <i>N. E. Hist. and

<p>John Adams (<i>Works</i>, ii. 507; ix. 617) said of
<i>Common Sense</i> that it embodied a "tolerable
summary of the arguments for independence
which he had been speaking in Congress for
nine months", and which Mahon (vi. 96) has
called "cogent arguments" "in clear, bold language;"
but Adams deemed unwise some of its
suggestions for the governments of the States,
and to counteract their influence he published
anonymously his <i>Thoughts on Government</i> (Philadelphia,
1776; Boston, 1776; often since, and
also in <i>Works</i>, iv. 193; ix. 387, 398), which he
says met the approval of no one of any consideration
except Benjamin Rush. He added
his name to the second edition, and records that
it soon had due influence upon the Assemblies
of the several States, when about this time they
adopted their constitutions. Adams's views
were first embodied in a letter to R. H. Lee,
Nov. 15, 1775 (<i>Works</i>, iv. 185; Sparks's <i>Washington</i>,
ii., App.). What seems an anonymous
reply from a native of Virginia&mdash;that colony
being then engaged in framing a constitution&mdash;was
<i>An address to the Convention of the Colony
and Ancient Dominion of Virginia</i>, which was an
attempt to counteract the tendency to popular
features in government, which Adams had inculcated.
It is in Force, 4th ser., vi. 748, and
was written by Carter Braxton (Hildeburn's <i>Issues
of the press in Pennsylvania</i>, Philad., 1886,
no. 3,340).</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">THE STRUGGLE FOR THE HUDSON.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY GEORGE W. CULLUM,</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>Major-General United States Army.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">WHEN, in March, 1776, the British evacuated Boston, Washington felt
assured that New York, already threatened, would be their objective point,
not only on account of its commercial and strategical importance, but because
it was the great arsenal of America. He therefore, as soon as practicable,
concentrated in and about it his whole disposable force, and pushed
forward the defences of the city and of its vicinity, already planned and partly
executed by General Lee. Until the arrival of Washington, April 13, 1776,
General Putnam commanded at New York, and General Greene, with a
considerable body of troops, took charge of the incomplete intrenchments
of Brooklyn, extending from the Wallabout (the present Navy Yard) to
Gowanus Cove on New York Bay. These were now strengthened by four
redoubts armed with twenty pieces of artillery, and by a strong interior
keep mounting seven guns. These Brooklyn Heights, from their proximity
and command of New York, were considered the key of the defence of this
valuable city.</p>

<p>Fort George, with several redoubts and batteries, guarded the southern
end of Manhattan Island, while the fortified hills overlooking Kingsbridge
protected its northern extremity. On Red and Paulus Hooks, and at various
points along the shores of the East and Hudson rivers, were erected earthworks,
and a strong redoubt was built upon Governor's Island. Between the
latter and the "Battery", hulks were sunk to obstruct the main channel.
Notwithstanding all these defences, Manhattan Island, as events proved,
was assailable at many points.</p>

<p>To defend these works, scattered over more than twenty miles, Washington
had an army of only 17,225 men, of whom 6,711 were sick, on furlough,
or detached, leaving but 10,514 present for duty. Most of these were
militia, badly clothed, imperfectly armed, without discipline or military experience,
and their artillery was old and of various patterns and calibres.</p>

<p>There had been dispatched from England a powerful fleet under Lord
Howe, convoying a large body of troops to reinforce those already in America.
The army of General William Howe (brother of the Admiral) on Staten
Island in August (including some 8,600 German hirelings) numbered, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
stated by General Clinton, 31,625 rank and file, of whom 24,464 were well-appointed,
disciplined soldiers, fit for duty and equal to any in Europe.</p>

<p>The struggle for the Hudson, by the coöperation of the army of Canada
with Howe, was now about to begin; but Washington was at his wits' end
to foresee the particular point upon which the blow would fall. Hence he
was obliged to retain the greater part of his troops in New York to defend
the city, holding them ready, however, to support any point in the vicinity
whether assailed by the enemy's large fleet or by their powerful army.</p>

June, 1790, when the house, then owned by Mrs.
Jephson, was occupied by John Adams, as Vice-President
of the United States. It was at one

<i>Burr</i>, i. 81.</p>

<p class="pf400">Washington's first headquarters in New York
were probably at a house, 180 Pearl St., opposite
Cedar St., sometimes called the house of Gov.
Geo. Clinton, of which a view is given in Valentine's
<i>Manual</i>, 1854, p. 446, and in Lossing's
<i>Mary and Martha Washington</i> (N. Y., 1886), p.
153. He is also supposed by some to have occupied
for a short interval the Kennedy mansion,
No. 1 Broadway, known to have been used
certainly by Col. Knox as artillery headquarters,
of which a view is given in Irving's <i>Washington</i>,
illus. ed. ii. 211, and in Gay's <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>,
iii. 495. (Cf. Drake's <i>Knox</i>; Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>,
ii. 594; Johnston's <i>Campaign of 1776</i>, p. 86.)
In June, if not earlier, he removed to the Mortier
House on Richmond Hill, and remained
there till September, when he transferred his
headquarters first to the Apthorp House (view
in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, 1885, p. 227), still standing
at the corner of Ninth Avenue and Ninety-first
Street, and next to the Morris House at
Harlem.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>On the morning of August 22, 1776, General Howe, under cover of the
guns of the British ships, without mishap, delay, or opposition, debarked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
as stated by Admiral Howe, about 15,000 men, with artillery, baggage,
and stores, on Long Island, in the vicinity of the Narrows; and on the
25th, General de Heister's German division was landed at Gravesend Cove.
This invading force of "upwards of 20,000 rank and file", well armed and
with forty cannon, promptly occupied a line extending from the Narrows,
through Gravesend, to Flatlands, and made ready for an immediate advance
through the passes of the long range of densely wooded hills running
eastwardly from the Narrows to Jamaica, about two and a half miles
in front of Brooklyn. To oppose this large force of regular troops, the
Americans had not quite 8,000 men, most of whom were raw militia, and of
these about one half were outside of the defences of Brooklyn, ready to
participate in the impending battle.</p>

<p>The most direct route from the British landing-place to the Brooklyn intrenchments
was by the road running nearly parallel to the bay, and passing
through a gorge just back of the Red Lion Tavern, where Martense Lane
joins the usual thoroughfare at the edge of Greenwood Cemetery. A second
road led from Flatbush directly through the pass defended by General
Sullivan's intrenchments. The third was by the road from Flatbush to
Bedford. Finally, the fourth, extending to Flushing, intersected the Bedford
and Jamaica road at the pass between the present Evergreen and Cypress
Cemeteries, about three miles east of Bedford, or about ten miles
from the Narrows.</p>

<p>When the British landed on the 22d, Colonel Hand's regiment was deployed
to oppose them, but the enemy proving to be in too great force,
Hand fell back to Prospect Hill and thence to Flatbush, burning property
which would be of immediate use to the foe; but he did not at once apprise
the commanding general of the real character of the British movement. So
soon, however, as Washington heard of the landing, he dispatched six regiments
to reinforce the garrison of Brooklyn Heights, and ordered additional
forces to be in readiness to cross the East River from Manhattan
Island, if Howe's movement did not prove to be a feint to cover a real attack
upon New York. General Greene, unfortunately, was too sick to retain the
active command on Long Island, every point of which, between Hell Gate
and the Narrows, he had carefully studied. He was succeeded, August 20th,
by General Sullivan, a far inferior officer.
As Washington said of him, he
was "active, spirited, and zealously attached
to the cause", but was tinctured
with "vanity, which now and then led him
into embarrassments;" besides which he
lacked "experience to move on a large
scale", as he had just shown in Canada.
On the 24th of August, Washington
placed Putnam in command over Sullivan.
Putnam was a brave soldier, but
wholly ignorant of the science of war,
besides being advanced in years. He
was entirely unacquainted with the arrangements
which had been made for
the defence of his position, and he never
went beyond the Brooklyn Heights intrenchments on the day of the battle.
The truth is, no one exercised a general command in that conflict.</p>

<p>De Heister's division, constituting the enemy's centre, occupied Flatbush
August 26th, threatening the pass in front, which Sullivan held with a large
force under cover of intrenchments. During the evening, Cornwallis withdrew
from Flatbush to Flatlands, there becoming the reserve of the British
right, which was composed of choice regiments under General Clinton, aided
by Lord Percy and accompanied by the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>The British plan of attack would have been very hazardous in the presence
of an enterprising enemy; but against undisciplined troops, small in
numbers and without skilful leadership, it proved a brilliant success. The
right, under Clinton, by a night march was to seize the Cypress Hill pass,
and then move down the Jamaica road towards Bedford to get in the rear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Sullivan's left. To divert the attention of the Americans from this stealthy
march, General Grant was to menace their right, towards Gravesend, before
daybreak, and De Heister at the same time was to cannonade the American
centre under Colonel Hand. These attacks were not, however, to be pressed
till General Clinton's guns were heard in the rear of Sullivan, when the
Americans were to be assailed with the utmost vigor from all quarters.
Besides these land operations a squadron of five ships, under Sir Peter
Parker, was to menace New York and keep up a cannonade against Governor's
Island and the right flank of the American defences.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Clinton, the principal actor in this contest, with his heavy column
and its artillery, guided by a Tory farmer, at nine in the evening of
the 26th, moved silently forward from Flatlands through New Lots (now
East New York), having successfully crossed Shoemaker's narrow causeway
over a long marsh. At three on the morning of the 27th, Clinton
arrived within half a mile of the pass he was to force, being followed and
joined before daybreak by the main body under Lord Percy. Soon after
daylight a small American patrol was captured and the unguarded pass
occupied. Thus the whole right wing of the enemy, after partaking of refreshments,
was marching unopposed directly to Brooklyn Heights. The
battle, by this bold and lucky manœuvre, was in this way virtually gained
before any real struggle had begun.</p>

<p>General Grant, on the enemy's left, with two brigades and a regiment,
two companies of Tories and ten pieces of artillery, in the mean time advanced
along the bay road against the flying Americans, and, at daybreak
of the 27th, got through the pass in the hills and was marching on the
Brooklyn lines. General Parsons, in command of the American outpost on
the right, succeeded in rallying some of the fugitives and posting them advantageously
on a hill until the arrival of Lord Stirling, who, with 1,500
choice Continental troops, had been sent by Putnam on learning the condition
of affairs. For some hours Grant amused Stirling by slight skirmishes
about Battle Hill (now in Greenwood Cemetery), till Clinton had reached his
destined goal, when Grant, with quadruple forces, pushed forward to grapple
in a death-struggle with his gallant foe. At the same time De Heister,
who had slept upon his arms during the night at Flatbush, as soon as he
heard Clinton's signal guns, sent Count Donop to storm the redoubt which
protected Sullivan and defended the pass through the hills, while he himself
pressed forward with the main body of the Hessians. Sullivan, hemmed
in on all sides, ordered a retreat to the Brooklyn lines, but it was too late,
as he was already ensnared in the prepared net, and before long all was a
scene of confusion, consternation, and slaughter. Some of the Americans,
after fighting desperately, broke through the enemy's line, but a large number
were killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. Washington, from Brooklyn,
witnessed this sad catastrophe, but was powerless to prevent it.</p>

<p>Stirling in like manner, met by the force under Cornwallis, which had
been detached from Clinton's column, was nearly surrounded, having no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
chance for escape except across Gowanus Creek, in which the tide was fast
rising. After a terrible conflict of twenty minutes, the mass of Stirling's
command succeeded in passing the muddy stream, but the general and
some of his bravest companions were compelled to surrender to superior
numbers. Washington wrung his hands in agony at the sight of such disaster.
"Good God", he cried, "what brave fellows I must this day lose!"</p>

<p>By two o'clock in the afternoon, this battle, or rather this series of skirmishes
between forces very unequal in numbers, quality, and skill, was terminated
by the retreat of the remnant of Americans which had escaped
capture. Howe stated his loss at 367 killed, wounded, and missing; and
he estimated that of the Americans at 3,300, though probably it did not exceed
one half of that number, of whom 1,076, including Generals Stirling,
Sullivan, and Woodhull (captured at Jamaica on the next day), were made
prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately the victor, instead of pressing his advantage and at once assaulting
the Brooklyn intrenchments, which covered the demoralized troops,
waited till the next day, when he broke ground as for a regular siege, and
began cannonading the American works. "By such ill-timed caution", says
Lord Mahon, "arising probably from an overestimate of the insurgents'
force, the English general flung away the fairest opportunity of utterly destroying
or capturing the flower of the American army;" yet such was the
joy of the British government over this cheap success that General Howe was
knighted for a victory over inexperienced troops one fifth his own numbers.</p>

<p>Washington, promptly profiting by the over-caution of his antagonist,
strengthened his position, and conceived the masterly measures for his retreat
from Long Island. Without the knowledge of Howe, availing himself
of a dense fog and rain, and favored by a fair wind, he safely crossed the
East River with all his troops, stores, and artillery, except a few heavy
pieces which the mud prevented him from moving. The army reached
New York on the morning of the 30th, Washington leaving in the last boat
after having been forty-eight hours almost continuously in the saddle without
once closing his eyes. "Whoever", says Botta, "will attend to all the
details of this retreat will easily believe that no military operation was ever
conducted by great captains with more ability and prudence, or under more
unfavorable auspices."</p>

<p>Though the British general had gained a decided success, he was as far
as ever from the object of his campaign&mdash;the capture of New York. The
victors and the vanquished now confronted each other from opposite sides
of a stream half a mile broad, each making ready for a decisive effort.
Howe possessed a large, veteran, and disciplined European army, while
Washington's troops, for the most part, were a demoralized assemblage of
heterogeneous organizations, not much superior to an armed mob.</p>

<p>"Our situation", writes Washington to the President of Congress, "is
truly distressing. The check our detachment sustained on the 27th ultimo
has dispirited too great a proportion of our troops, and filled their minds
with apprehension and despair. The militia, instead of calling forth their
utmost efforts to a brave and manly opposition in order to repair our losses,
are discouraged, intractable, and impatient to return. Great numbers of
them have gone off: in some instances almost by whole regiments, by half
ones, and by companies at a time. This circumstance of itself, independently
of others, when fronted by a well-appointed enemy superior in numbers
to our whole collected force, would be sufficiently disagreeable; but
when their example has infected another part of the army, when their want
of discipline and refusal of almost every kind of restraint and government
have produced a like conduct but too common to the whole, and an entire
disregard of that order and subordination necessary to the well-doing of an
army, and which had been inculcated before, as well as the nature of our
military establishment would admit of, our condition becomes more alarming;
and, with the deepest concern, I am obliged to confess my want of confidence
in the generality of the troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"All these circumstances fully confirm the opinion I ever entertained,
and which I more than once in my letters took the liberty of mentioning
to Congress, that no dependence could be put in a militia, or other troops,
than those enlisted and embodied for a longer period than our regulations
heretofore have prescribed. I am persuaded, and as fully convinced as I
am of any one fact that has happened, that our liberties must of necessity
be greatly hazarded, if not entirely lost, if their defence is left to any but
a permanent standing army; I mean, one to exist during the war. Nor
would the expense incident to the support of such a body of troops as would
be competent to almost every emergency far exceed that which is daily incurred
by calling in succor and new enlistments, which, when effected, are
not attended with any good consequences. Men who have been free and
subject to no control cannot be reduced to order in an instant; and the
privileges and exemptions, which they claim and will have, influence the conduct
of others; and the aid derived from them is nearly counterbalanced by
the disorder, irregularity, and confusion they occasion."</p>

<p>Three weeks later, he again writes: "It becomes evident to me, then,
that, as this contest is not likely to be the work of a day, as the war must
be carried on systematically, and to do it you must have good officers, there
are no other possible means to obtain them but by establishing your army
upon a permanent footing, and giving your officers good pay. This will
induce gentlemen and men of character to engage; and till the bulk of
your officers is composed of such persons as are actuated by principles of
honor and a spirit of enterprise, you have little to expect from them....
But while the only merit an officer possesses is his ability to raise men,
while these men consider and treat him as an equal, and in the character
of an officer regard him no more than a broomstick, being mixed together
as one common herd, no order nor discipline can prevail; nor will the officer
ever meet with that respect which is essentially necessary to due subordination.
To place any dependence upon militia is assuredly resting upon a
broken staff.... To bring men to a proper degree of subordination is not
the work of a day, a month, or even a year; and unhappily for us and the
cause we are engaged in, the little discipline I have been laboring to establish
in the army under my immediate command is in a manner done away
with by having such a mixture of troops as have been called together within
these few months....</p>

<p>"The jealousy of a standing army and the evils to be apprehended from
one are remote, and in my judgment, situated and circumstanced as we are,
not at all to be dreaded; but the consequence of wanting one, according
to my ideas formed from the present view of things, is certain and inevitable
ruin. For, if I was called upon to declare upon oath whether the
militia have been most serviceable or hurtful, upon the whole, I should subscribe
to the latter."</p>

<p>The defeat of the American army on Long Island, a heavy blow to the
patriot cause, suggested a desperate remedy to the mind of Washington,&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
less a measure than the deliberate destruction of the great commercial
city of New York. "Till of late", he writes to the President of Congress,
"I had no doubt in my own mind of defending this place; nor should I
have yet if the men would do their duty, but this I despair of.... If we
should be obliged to abandon the town, ought it to stand as winter-quarters
for the enemy? They would derive great conveniences from it on the one
hand, and much property would be destroyed on the other.... At present
I dare say the enemy mean to preserve it if they can. If Congress, therefore,
should resolve upon the destruction of it, the resolution should be a
profound secret, as the knowledge of it will make a capital change in their
plans." General Greene, John Jay, and many others of note were of the
same opinion. Congress decided otherwise, and Howe forbore to bombard
it from Brooklyn Heights and Governor's Island, both belligerents deeming
its possession of far greater service to either than its destruction.</p>

<p>As New York was not to be destroyed, it became a serious question how
a city swarming with Tories was to be defended with less than twenty thousand
militia against a powerful army. Washington, Greene, Putnam, and
others were opposed to the attempt, but were overruled by a council of war.
The question was finally left by Congress to the commander-in-chief, who,
deeming the city untenable, made preparations, September 10th, for its
speedy evacuation, which was concurred in, two days later, by a new council
of war. This determination was timely, as the Americans were about to
be driven out.</p>

<p>Howe, anticipating Washington's design, determined to prevent the execution
of it by the same manœuvre he had tried so successfully on Long
Island,&mdash;that was to threaten the city's front and right flank by the fleet,
while his army, assembled about the present site of Astoria, should cross
the East River, turn Washington's left flank, cut off his communications
with the mainland, oblige him to fight on the enemy's terms, and force him
to surrender at discretion, or by a brilliant stroke break the American army
in pieces, and secure their arms and stores.</p>

<p>On the evening of September 14th Howe began his crossing of the East
River by taking possession of Montressor (Randall's) Island, and the next
morning he sent three ships up the Hudson as high as Bloomingdale, which
stopped any further evacuation of the city by water. Soon after, under the
fire of ten vessels-of-war, the main British force, under Sir Henry Clinton,
embarked upon flatboats, barges, and galleys, at the mouth of Newtown
Creek, and by the favoring tide was carried to Kip's Bay (34th Street),
where they disembarked and quickly put to rout the panic-stricken American
militia, and pursued the fugitives in disorderly flight over the fields to
Murray Hill.</p>

<p>So soon as Washington heard the enemy's cannonade he rode with all
speed to the front, and used every exertion to rally the runaways; but his
efforts, though seconded by the officers in immediate command, were utterly
futile. Mortified and in despair at such poltroonery, the commander-in-chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
almost lost control of himself, and, says General Greene, "sought death rather
than life" at the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>Unopposed, the British marched to the Incleberg on Murray Hill and
encamped, while the Americans retreated to Harlem Heights. Putnam, at
the sacrifice of baggage and stores, and of most of his heavy artillery, by
taking the river road, barely escaped with the troops remaining in the city.
Howe was in close pursuit of this rear-guard of about four thousand men,
but unexpectedly stopped for nearly two hours at the residence of Mrs.
Murray<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> to enjoy her old Madeira, so that, in the language of the times,
"Mrs. Murray saved the American army."</p>

<p>The British, on September 15, 1776, took possession of New York with
a large detachment under General Robertson; while Howe with the main
body of the army encamped on the outskirts of the city. The northern line
of their camp extended from Horen's Hook on the East River to Bloomingdale
on the Hudson, which line was fortified with field-works and protected
on the flanks by vessels-of-war. Behind this line lay their disciplined
army of twenty-five thousand British and Germans.</p>

<p>Washington took position in their front, and for the protection of his
army of about fourteen thousand fit for duty he fortified Harlem Heights
with a triple line of intrenchments extending across Manhattan Island. Immediately
after securing his position, Washington, to arouse some military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
ardor in his discomfited militia, formed the design of cutting off some of
the enemy's light troops, who, encouraged by their recent successes, had
advanced to the extremity of the high ground opposite to the American
camp. To effect this object, Colonel Knowlton, of Bunker Hill fame, and
Major Leitch were detached with parties of rangers and riflemen to get in
their rear, while Washington diverted their attention by a feigned direct
attack. By some mistake, the fire was begun on the front instead of upon
their flank and rear, by which the enemy, though defeated, secured their
escape to their main body. This successful skirmish, called the battle of
Harlem Plains, was purchased by the loss of the brave Knowlton and Leitch,
both of whom were mortally wounded.</p>

<p>The British rejoicings upon the occupation of their snug winter-quarters
in New York were suddenly interrupted, early on the morning of September
21st, by the breaking out of flames from a low groggery near Whitehall
Slip, which, for want of proper fire apparatus to check them, spread rapidly
over one fourth of the city, consuming five hundred buildings, including the
Lutheran and Trinity churches. Whether this was the work of incendiaries
is not positively known. Congress and the city's inhabitants had strenuously
opposed such an act, though it was strongly recommended as a military
necessity by Washington and by others of high rank and position.</p>

<p>While Howe "continued at gaze" awaiting coming events, Washington
continued to strengthen his position on Harlem Heights, and established
alarm posts on the east side of Harlem River as far as Throg's Neck on the
Sound, to insure surveillance of the whole field of operations.</p>

<p>The Harlem lines being too strong for a front attack, Howe, after leaving
a sufficient force under Lord Percy to watch them and guard the city, embarked,
October 12th, his main army on ninety flatboats, to execute by his
favorite manœuvre the turning of these obstacles and of Washington's left
flank. His object was to cut off Washington's retreat and shut him up on
Manhattan Island, the only exit from which was by Kingsbridge. Adverse
winds so delayed the British general that he only passed Hell Gate on the
afternoon of the 14th, and the fleet did not reach Throg's Neck till nightfall.
Here Howe had previously landed his advance-guard, but Washington
had anticipated him by occupying, on the 12th, the passes leading to
the mainland.</p>

<p>The enemy's design being now fully developed, it was decided in a council
of war, held in the American camp on the 16th, to leave Harlem Heights,
no longer tenable, and to evacuate the whole of Manhattan Island except
Fort Washington, which General Greene deemed impregnable and of great
value for future operations. Accordingly, the American army formed a
series of intrenched camps on the hills skirting the right bank of the swollen
Bronx, and extending thirteen miles, from Fordham Heights to White
Plains, and protected from the enemy by the river in front.</p>

<p>After waiting five days for supplies, Howe, on the 18th, left Throg's
Neck, debarked again on Pell's Point, and on the march northward encountered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Glover's brigade well posted behind stone fences. After a hot skirmish
Glover slowly fell back, while the enemy advanced to the heights of
New Rochelle. Here the British encamped till the 22d, when they were
joined by the second division of Hessians under General Knyphausen. This
delay gave Washington ample time to strengthen himself at White Plains,
where he held a strong and important strategic position commanding the
roads leading up the Hudson and to New England.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th of October the opposing armies, each about
thirteen thousand strong, confronted each other. Washington's intrenchments,
partly a double line, occupied the hilly ground within the village of
White Plains, the left resting upon a mill-pond and the right on a bend of
the Bronx, which protected its flank and rear. Across the Bronx rose Chatterton's
Hill, presenting a steep rocky front to the enemy, but it was not
fortified.</p>

<p>Howe, believing he was now to fight the decisive battle of the war, moved
up in two heavy columns, Clinton commanding the one on the right and
De Heister that on the left. They seemed at first as if intending to attack
in front; but they soon filed off to the left, extending their line to the
front of Chatterton's Hill. Here the main body halted, while a column four
thousand strong proceeded to cross the Bronx and storm the hill under
cover of the fire of twenty pieces of artillery. General McDougall with
fifteen hundred Continentals and militia, and Captain Alexander Hamilton
with two pieces of artillery, immediately arrayed themselves on the rocky
brow of the hill for its defence. As the main British body, under General
Leslie, clambered up the steep acclivity it was met by a withering fire from
the infantry and artillery, from which it recoiled and sought shelter. A
second assault up the slope met with an equally determined resistance, and
for some time the enemy was held in check. Rahl, with two regiments
that had forded the Bronx a quarter of a mile below, now appeared on the
American right, and drove the militia from their post. This break compelled
McDougall, exposed to a heavy fire in front and flank, to retreat
across the Bronx to White Plains, though with his six hundred Continentals
he maintained an obstinate conflict for an hour, and carried off all his
wounded and artillery. The American loss in the engagement was 30 prisoners
and 130 killed and wounded, while their opponents' losses were 231.</p>

<p>Howe contemplated an assault, the next morning, upon the American
camp, but was deterred by the apparent strength of the lines. These had
been built hastily, as General Heath says, of <i>corn-stalks</i>, the tops being
turned inwards, and the roots with the adhering earth outwards. The British
army, strongly reinforced by the arrival of Lord Percy on the 30th, designed
attacking the American works on the following day, but a storm
delayed their operations, and gave Washington time to withdraw his forces
to the heights of New Castle, where he erected strong defences. In the
meanwhile Knyphausen had been ordered to move from New Rochelle to
Kingsbridge, where he encamped on November 2d, the Americans retiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to Fort Washington on his approach. Howe in person suddenly left White
Plains on the night of the 5th for Dobbs's Ferry, to which his army was
already moving. "The design of this manœuvre", wrote Washington on
the 6th to the President of Congress, "is a matter of much conjecture and
speculation, and cannot be accounted for with any degree of certainty." A
council of war which met that day evidently inferred that it threatened a
movement across or up the Hudson, for it was unanimously agreed immediately
to throw a body of troops into New Jersey, and station three thousand
at Peekskill to guard the Highlands. Howe really contemplated a far
different move&mdash;the capture of Fort Washington.</p>

<p>Why Sir William did not again attack Washington, and why he changed
his whole plan, is now well understood to be due to the treason of William
Demont, the adjutant of Colonel Magaw, in command of Fort Washington.
This man, on the 2d of November, undiscovered, passed into the British
camp, and placed in the hands of Lord Percy complete plans of the defences
of Mount Washington and a statement of their armament and garrisons.
This detailed information was immediately sent, with its author, to Howe,
and must have reached him a day or two before his sudden departure from
White Plains. The conclusive evidence of this treason is furnished by the
culprit himself in his letter,<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> dated London, January 16, 1792, to the Rev.
Dr. Peters, of the Church of England, which was first published by Mr. E.
F. DeLancey, in the <i>Magazine of American History</i> (Feb., 1877).</p>

<p>Fort Washington, built by Colonel Rufus Putnam soon after the evacuation
of Boston, occupied the highest ground at the northern end of Manhattan
Island. It was a pentagonal bastioned earthwork without a keep,
having a feeble profile and scarcely any ditch. In its vicinity were batteries,
redoubts, and intrenched lines. These various field fortifications, of
which Fort Washington may be considered the citadel, extended north and
south over two and a half miles, and had a circuit of six miles. The three
intrenched lines of Harlem Heights, crossing the island, were to the south;
Laurel Hill, with Fort George at its northern extremity, lay to the east;
upon the River Ridge, near Tubby Hook, was Fort Tryon, and close to
Spuyten Duyvel Creek were some slight works known as "Cork Hill
Fort;" and across the creek, on Tetard's Hill, was Fort Independence.
The main communication with these various works was the old Albany
road, crossing Harlem River at Kingsbridge. This road was obstructed by
three lines of abatis, extending from Laurel Hill to the River Ridge.</p>

<p>Fort Washington mounted not more than eighteen guns <i>en barbette</i>, of
various calibres, from nines to thirty-twos. The garrison of all the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
works was less than 3,000 men, mostly Pennsylvanians, who were commanded
by Colonel Magaw, an officer of but little military experience. The ground
about the fort was well suited for defence, and the works not only protected
the upper part of Manhattan Island, but in conjunction with Fort
Lee, on the palisades opposite, commanded the Hudson. However, from
their too elevated positions and distance from each other, these two works,
on the opposite sides of the river, with their feeble armament, proved insufficient,
even with a partially constructed barrier of sunken hulks, to prevent
the passage of the British vessels-of-war.</p>

<p>As these forts did not close the river, Washington did not deem it expedient
to weaken his force, which was necessary to him for field operations,
by leaving a large garrison on an island essentially in the hands of the
enemy. To the opinion of General Greene, in general command of these
works, and in deference to the expressed wishes of Congress to hold them
at any cost, Washington yielded his better judgment. His modesty and
sense of imperfect knowledge of the science and practice of war led him,
as it did on several occasions, to defer too much to others, and though he
did not think it "prudent to hazard the men and stores at Mount Washington",
he left it discretionary with Greene to give the necessary orders
for its evacuation.</p>

<p>Howe, November 15th, demanded the surrender of Fort Washington,
stating that, if he were compelled to take it by assault, the garrison would
be put to the sword. Magaw replied that to propose such an alternative
was unworthy of a British officer, and that, for himself, he should defend
the fort to the last extremity.</p>

<p>On the 15th Washington started across the river from Fort Lee, to which
he had come, to determine the condition of the garrison at Fort Washington.
He says, "I had partly crossed the North River when I met General Putnam
and General Greene, who were just returning from thence, and they
informed me that the troops were in high spirits and would make a good
defence, and, it being late at night, I returned."</p>

<p>Magaw, awaiting the enemy's attack, made a judicious disposition of his
forces to defend Fort Washington and the various intrenchments in its
vicinity. Colonel Rawlings took command of Fort Tryon and the northern
end of the River Ridge, with an outpost at Cork Hill Fort; Colonel Baxter
held Fort George and the summit of Laurel Hill; Colonel Cadwallader
occupied the Harlem Lines; while Magaw, at his central position of Fort
Washington, directed the whole.</p>

<p>Howe's attack upon Fort Washington was skilfully planned and admirably
executed. A vessel-of-war, the "Pearl", took up a position in the Hudson
to protect the contemplated movement of the Hessian troops and enfilade
the northern outworks of Fort Washington; while thirty flatboats were in
the Harlem River for ferrying troops,&mdash;these boats having eluded the
vigilance of the American sentries on the night of the 14th, when passing
up the Hudson and through Spuyten Duyvel Creek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th, under a furious cannonade from the heights
on the east bank of the Harlem, three distinct assaults were ordered to be
made upon the American defences, besides a fourth movement, which,
though designed as a feint, became a real attack at the critical moment.
The <i>first</i> British column, under General Knyphausen, moved down from
Kingsbridge, and with him were Rahl's Germans marching close to the
Hudson; the <i>second</i>, under General Matthews, supported by Lord Cornwallis,
crossed the Harlem and moved upon Fort George and the northern
end of Laurel Hill; the <i>third</i>, or feint, under Lieut.-Col. Stirling, floated
down the Harlem to threaten the southerly part of Laurel Hill; while the
<i>fourth</i>, of British and Hessians, led by Earl Percy and accompanied by
Howe, moved from Harlem Plain upon the triple lines of Harlem Heights.</p>

<div class="floatright">
     <img src="images/ill-289.jpg" width="200" height="171" id="i289"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The latter column, advancing from the south, began the attack upon the
outer or southernmost American line, where Cadwallader, unable to check
Lord Percy's superior forces, fell back to his stronger middle line. Howe
then ordered Stirling to land from the Harlem and clamber up the steep
slope of Laurel Hill to threaten the rear of Cadwallader. The latter sent a
detachment, as did also Colonel Magaw, to oppose Stirling's landing, without
avail. Matthews at the same time debarked his column and attacked
the Americans on Laurel Hill, where Baxter was killed. The united forces
of Matthews and Stirling overcame all opposition and took 170 prisoners.
Baxter's force was compelled, as was also Cadwallader, when pressed by
Percy, to seek refuge in Fort Washington. About noon the Hessian column
from the north was in motion. Rahl soon scattered the small guard in Cork
Hill Fort and advanced upon Fort Tryon, crowding Rawlings by superior
force nearly back to Fort Washington, when, being joined by Knyphausen,
who had made his way over wooded and difficult
ground and across abatis, the reunited German
columns bore down all opposition. The Americans
at this point also, after a spirited resistance,
were compelled to take refuge in Fort
Washington, which, now overcrowded and exposed
to the deadly concentric fire of the enemy,
left Magaw no alternative but surrender. He
asked for a parley of four hours, but he was allowed
only half an hour. In the end he capitulated, upon honorable terms,
to General Knyphausen, to whom the glory of the day belonged. Magaw
had received a promise from Washington to attempt to bring off the troops
if he would hold out till night, which Magaw deemed impossible, with troops
huddled together and exposed to destruction from the enemy's near circle of
fire. This capture cost the enemy nearly 500 men in killed and wounded. The
American loss was 150 killed and wounded, 2,634 taken prisoners (including
many of their best troops), 43 pieces of artillery of from three to
thirty-two pounds calibre, a large number of small arms, and much ammunition
and stores. The whole of Manhattan Island thus passed into British
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately after the capture of Fort Washington, Sir William Howe
crossed with his army into New Jersey, it being too late for any coöperation
with the Northern army under General Carleton, who had already
retreated from Crown Point into Canada.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p class="p2">This New York campaign had been most disastrous to the American
cause; yet it was far from a brilliant success for the Anglo-Hessian arms.
Washington, with troops inferior in numbers, arms, organization, discipline,
and experience, had outgeneralled Howe, with a superior veteran army,
whenever he acted upon his own good judgment and did not yield his convictions
to his subordinates, to whom most of the errors of the campaign
were due.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether there was any necessity whatever for the British
to fight the battle of Long Island, as their fleet might have occupied the
East River, as it subsequently did, and thus have caged the part of Washington's
army which was on Long Island. It is true that the American
batteries on Brooklyn Heights and Governor's Island might have done the
fleet much damage; but if it was too dangerous to run the gauntlet of the
Buttermilk Channel, four fathoms deep, it would have been an easy matter
to sail around the eastern end of Long Island, and safely enter the East
River from that direction.</p>

<p>Had the East River been occupied by the British fleet, it could, while
cutting off half of our army from the defence of New York, at the same
time have threatened the city front pending the transportation of the British
army by water to points above the city from whence to turn either or
both flanks of Manhattan Island. Washington, thus shut up, would have
been compelled to fight at great disadvantage, and possibly surrender at
discretion.</p>

<p>Even admitting that the battle of Long Island was necessary, Howe,
in dividing his army into three masses, stretching over a line of more than
ten miles, ran great risk of being beaten in detail had all of the American
forces on the island been concentrated at a central position, ready to be
thrown successively upon his isolated columns. It is true the undisciplined
American forces might not have been able to cope in the open field with
British and German regulars; but Howe had no right to presume their inferiority
after his own experience of their good conduct at Bunker Hill and
Clinton's trial at Sullivan's Island.</p>

<p>The American general also committed a great military blunder in leaving
with raw troops the shelter of the Brooklyn intrenchments for the precarious
protection of the Long Island Ridge, several important passes in
which were left entirely unguarded, though Washington had ordered their
careful observation.</p>

<p>After the retreat of the American army to New York, Howe wasted two
precious weeks, during which Washington had time to organize his defence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and when the British general crossed the East River, he committed a great
mistake in debarking at Kip's Bay,&mdash;a halfway measure which involved
a long land march to his objective, White Plains. Washington, with great
vigor, seized his advantage, and, by availing himself of his shorter interior
line, arrived first at the coveted position and fortified it. Had Howe
moved to this point by water immediately after the battle of Long Island,
he undoubtedly would have succeeded in turning Washington's left flank,
and would thus have cut off his retreat. The British general's delay of <i>two
months</i> after the battle of Long Island in moving less than thirty miles to
reach White Plains was inexcusable. In a shorter period Moltke began
and ended the campaign of 1866, which so humbled the great power of the
Austrian empire.</p>

<p>When Howe decided to attack the American army at White Plains he
should have thrown his entire force upon Washington's centre, and thus
have won a decisive victory with his superior troops; whereas he used less
than one third of his army in driving Washington's right wing from Chatterton's
Hill upon his main body, which then successfully retreated before
the tardy and inert British general.</p>

<p>Howe's good fortune in capturing Fort Washington was due more to the
treason of Magaw's adjutant and to Washington's yielding to bad advice,
than to any skill of the British commander.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p class="p2">With the invasion of New Jersey by the Anglo-Hessian army all military
operations at the mouth of the Hudson were terminated. The struggle
for the control of this great river was to be transferred to its upper
waters, and it was expected that the coming campaign would be so conducted
as soon to force the whole power of the colonies into silence and
submission.</p>

<p>General Gates, who was appointed the successor of Sullivan in the command
of the army of Canada, was, says Horace Walpole, "the son of a
housekeeper of the second Duke of Leeds." He had neither brilliant qualities
nor military genius, but possessed the vanity and ambition to covet
the highest position, for the attainment of which he resorted to disgraceful
intrigue. When assigned to this command, in June, 1776, the army of
Canada was flying to Crown Point; so, like Sancho Panza, Gates found
himself a governor without a government; but, nothing abashed, he at
once claimed the command of the Northern department, then under Schuyler.
Congress sustained the latter, whereupon Gates took post at Ticonderoga,
where the remnant of the American army had retired upon the
abandonment of Crown Point, and promptly adopted vigorous measures to
put the work in good condition for defence and to reinforce its garrison
against any forward movement of General Carleton.</p>

<p>To secure control of Lake Champlain, a squadron of small vessels was
ordered to be constructed at its head (Skenesborough), which, to the
number of nine, mounting in all fifty-five guns, were completed by the middle
of August. Arnold, in command of these and some additional galleys
from Ticonderoga,
moved down to the
foot of the lake, and
anchored his vessels
across it to bar
the passage of the
enemy.</p>

<p>Carleton, as active
as his adversary,
had built at
St. Johns a flotilla
of "thirty fighting
vessels." When
Arnold discovered
the superiority of
the enemy's fleet
in vessels and guns
to be more than
double his own, and
that they were
manned by picked
British sailors, he
fell back and
formed line of battle
between Valcour's
Island and
the western shore
of the lake. In
this disadvantageous
position he
was attacked, October
11th, by Captain
Pringle, of the
British navy, with thirty-eight vessels and boats, mounting 123 guns.
Though the crews of Arnold's flotilla were landsmen, he maintained a
desperate fight from eleven in the forenoon until dark, when, availing
himself of the obscurity of a thick fog, he escaped with part of his vessels,
unobserved, through the enemy's fleet; but, owing to adverse winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and his crippled condition, he was overtaken on the 13th off Split Rock,
where he was again attacked. Some of his flotilla escaped and some were
captured, but he himself, after fighting four hours, ran his remaining vessels
ashore, set them on fire with their flags flying, and escaped with their
crews through the forests to Ticonderoga. General Carleton now advanced
to Crown Point, of which he took possession October 14th, and pushed a
reconnoissance to within sight of Ticonderoga. When Carleton's boats appeared,
Gates made an effective display of his garrison, whereupon the British
general fell back to Crown Point, which he evacuated, and, it being too
late for further active operations, he retired to Canada.</p>

<p>The enemy had
scarcely departed when
Schuyler applied himself
with tireless assiduity
to prepare against
a new invasion during
that winter or in the
coming year. He continually
pressed upon
Congress and Washington
the wants of his
department in men and
munitions of war. In
every way he tried to
conciliate the Indian
tribes; and he lost no
opportunity of gaining
information of the enemy's
designs and movements.</p>

<p>Burgoyne, after the
battle of Bunker Hill,
had suggested to Lord
Rochefort, Secretary of
State for the colonies, that, as there was "no probable prospect of
bringing the war to a speedy conclusion with any force that Great
Britain and Ireland could supply", there should be employed "a large
army of such foreign troops as might be hired, to begin their operations
up the Hudson River; another army, composed partly of old disciplined
troops and partly of Canadians, to act from Canada; a large levy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Indians and a supply of arms for the blacks, to awe the Southern provinces,
conjointly with detachments of regulars; and a numerous fleet to
sweep the whole coast,&mdash;might possibly do the business in one campaign."</p>

<p>The importance of securing the control of the Hudson, thereby to separate
the New England from the Middle and Southern States, was eminently
correct; but the proposed mode of accomplishing it was, as the
sequel proved, entirely wrong.</p>

<p>Burgoyne, like many other Englishmen, had held American prowess
in contempt, and ridiculed the enrolment of provincials as "a preposterous
parade of military arrangement." His later experience probably changed
his views, for when he had supplanted that noble soldier Sir Guy Carleton
in the command of the British army in Canada, through "family support"
more than from "military merit", he took good care to secure a strong and
veteran force, commanded by officers of noted skill and long experience.</p>

<p>Burgoyne's army, which took the field in July, 1777, had a total, rank
and file, of 7,902, of which 4,135 were British, 3,116 Germans, 148 Canadian
militia, and 503 Indians. The artillery corps and train were of the
most serviceable character, "probably the finest and most excellently supplied
as to officers and private men that had ever been allotted to second
the operations of any army."</p>

<p>The commander-in-chief was a polished gentleman, a popular dramatist,
an effective speaker, a useful member of Parliament, and a gallant officer
who had won laurels in Portugal; Major-General Phillips, the second in
command, was a distinguished artillerist who had earned a high reputation
in Germany; Major-General Riedesel had been selected because of his
long experience, especially in the Seven Years' War; Brigadier-General
Fraser, who commanded the light brigade, was a knightly soldier, ambitious
of glory, who had seen much service in America; Hamilton and Powel,
who commanded brigades, had been twenty years on active duty; Lord
Balcarras and Major Acland, commanding respectively the light infantry
and grenadiers, were soldiers of high professional attainments; La Corne
St. Luc, the commander of the Indians, had been an active partisan of the
French in Canada wars, and "was notorious for brutal inhumanity;" and
the many staff and regimental officers were already men of mark, or subsequently
rose to high positions.</p>

<p>With such a thoroughly disciplined and well-appointed army, Burgoyne
fondly anticipated making a triumphal march of two hundred miles to
Albany, there to meet St. Leger descending the Mohawk, and Howe ascending
the Hudson, and thus by combined movements to dismember the thirteen
United States. This march of the Northern army seemed not arduous,
as most of Burgoyne's way was by water through the Sorel, Lake
Champlain, and the upper Hudson; but he had taken little account of the
extraordinary physical difficulties he was doomed to encounter, and the
hostility of the inhabitants along much of his route.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>Another embarrassment greatly marred the British plans. Lord George
Germain, the Secretary of State
for the colonies, had given Burgoyne
positive orders for his
march to Albany, from which he
was not to deviate; while Howe
was left, through a piece of criminal
negligence,<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> without any imperative
instructions to coöperate
with the army in Canada; besides
which, it was almost impossible
to arrange any concerted
action between forces separated
by four hundred miles of hostile
country.</p>

<p>Burgoyne, however, like a true
soldier, determined to obey orders,
though it might break empires.
Consequently, on June
13th, at St. Johns, the standard
of England was hoisted on board
the "Radeau", and saluted by
all the rest of the shipping and
forts, thus announcing the beginning of this eventful and important campaign.</p>

<p>On the 20th, Burgoyne issued, with seeming royal prerogative, a bombastic
proclamation, commending the justice and clemency of the king,
who had directed "that Indians be employed;" denouncing the obstinacy
of Americans as "wilful outcasts;" threatening the terrors of savage
warfare of the "thousands of Indians" under his command, "to overtake
the hardened enemies of Great Britain;" and, "in consciousness of Christianity
and the honor of soldiership", warned all of his opposers that "the
messengers of justice and wrath await them on the field, and devastation,
famine, and every concomitant horror that a reluctant but indispensable
prosecution of military duty must occasion."<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Burgoyne, after delivering himself of this pronunciamiento of loving-kindness
towards his American erring brothers, and setting forth the sweet
humanity of his dusky allies, who "had sharpened their affections upon
their hatchets", proceeded up Lake Champlain, pioneered by these children
of the forest in their birch canoes, the fleet and army following, with music
and banners, as if engaged in a splendid regatta.</p>

<p>While Burgoyne with the main army was moving south, Lieutenant-Colonel
St. Leger, in conformity with instructions from the British cabinet,
with a detachment of about 1,000 men (English regulars, provincials, and
Indians), was rapidly advancing west to Fort Stanwix, by the St. Lawrence
and Lakes Ontario and Oneida. After reducing this post and subjugating
the patriots of the Mohawk valley, he was ordered to join his
chief at or near Albany.</p>

<p>Burgoyne's formidable invading force of 7,863 men, with 42 pieces of
artillery, which reached Crown Point June 27th, advanced thence, July 1st,
in battle array: the right wing of British troops under General Phillips,
upon Fort Ticonderoga on the west bank of the lake; the left wing of
Germans under General Riedesel, upon Fort Independence on the east
bank; and the floating batteries in line across the lake. Burgoyne had
announced in orders: "This army must not retreat."</p>

<p>General Schuyler had recently visited Forts Ticonderoga and Independence,
where, instead of a garrison of 5,000 men, he found only 2,546 half-armed
and poorly provided Continental troops and 900 raw militia, "many
of them mere boys, and one third of the whole force unfit for duty." He
noted, with serious forebodings, the unfitness of the works to resist attack,
a state to which lack of workmen and the neglect of Gates had brought
them. The reduction of this stronghold was indispensable to Burgoyne's
progress, not only as insuring his communications with Canada, but because
of the danger of leaving such a force in his rear.</p>

<p>In an endeavor to strengthen these fortifications, of which General St.
Clair had recently taken command, the works had been too much extended,
and the key-points&mdash;Mount Hope, commanding Fort Ticonderoga, and
Mount Defiance, a supposed inaccessible eminence at the confluence of the
waters of Lakes George and Champlain&mdash;had not been occupied; consequently,
they were seized by the British and artillery was planted upon them.</p>

<p>St. Clair, no favorite of fortune, finding himself nearly invested on the
5th, and exposed to a plunging fire from these heights, which he could
not return, wisely determined to evacuate all his works that night, under
pretence of making a sortie. As soon as it was dark enough, the women
and wounded, together with some ammunition and stores, were placed
upon 200 bateaux, which were to be escorted to Skenesborough by five
armed galleys and a guard of 600 men, all under the command of Colonel
Long. In thus abandoning Ticonderoga, St. Clair justified himself, saying
that "we had lost a post, but saved a province."</p>

<p>St. Clair, leaving his heavy artillery and many supplies behind, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the garrison of Fort Ticonderoga passed undisturbed, at midnight, over
the floating bridge across the lake. On the southern side the troops from
Fort Independence joined him, and all were safely escaping, when, without
orders, General De Fermois's headquarters were fired, the blaze of which
disclosed the retreat to the enemy. The alarm was at once given, and
the deserted forts were seized by the British. General Fraser was in pursuit
at daylight of the 6th, followed soon after by General Riedesel with
the German grenadiers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Burgoyne and Phillips, in the fleet,
broke through the boom and bridge
across the lake, in chase of Colonel
Long and the American flotilla,
which, on the afternoon of the 7th,
was overtaken and attacked at the
wharves of Skenesborough. Two
of the covering galleys struck their
colors, and the others were blown
up by their crews. The bateaux,
mills, and stockade there were
promptly burned, and then the detachment
fled to Fort Anne, eleven
miles below. Early the next morning
Long sallied out and had a
sharp encounter with his pursuers
under Colonel Hill; but when victory
was almost within his grasp,
the enemy was reinforced by a number
of savages sent forward by
Burgoyne, who had remained at
Skenesborough. Colonel Long,
after burning Fort Anne, retreated
sixteen miles to Fort Edward, where
he met Schuyler on his way to Ticonderoga with a small reinforcement.</p>

<p>St. Clair, with the main body, was even less fortunate. He retreated
through the wilderness to Castleton, his rear-guard of 1,200 men, under
Colonel Warner, stopping over night at Hubbardton, where on the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of the 8th it was attacked by Fraser with an inferior force. After a
spirited engagement Hale's militia regiment abandoned the field, and the
enemy was reinforced by the arrival of Riedesel's Brunswickers, which latter
turned the American right flank and compelled their retreat to Rutland,
the rendezvous appointed by St. Clair in the event of disaster. From here
the remnant of St. Clair's forces, by a circuitous march of more than a hundred
miles, on the 12th reached Fort Edward, where Schuyler, on the 20th,
could muster only 4,467 men fit for duty. This little army was deficient in
almost every requisite for battle, while Burgoyne, flushed with victory, lay
within a day's forced march with his veteran army of nearly double the
American force.</p>

<p>Schuyler was charged by Congress with "neglect of duty" in not ordering
a timely retreat of the garrison from Ticonderoga, if untenable; and, if
to be defended, not to have been present at the attack upon it. The court-martial,
of thirteen distinguished officers, unanimously acquitted him "with
the highest honor."<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<p>These reverses, which closed the first act of the drama of varied events
in this checkered campaign, seemed to open the way to Burgoyne's triumph,
and they spread universal alarm among the patriots, who had considered
Ticonderoga the closed gate to northern invasion. These disasters,
however, were blessings in disguise, despite the desertion of the militia.
Washington predicted ultimate success, and Schuyler was roused to great
efforts to oppose the enemy's advance. Wood Creek was at once obstructed
with logs and huge stones; all roads were broken up and their bridges
destroyed; dry land was converted into morass, trees were felled in every
direction, and the whole of this wild and savage country was stripped of
cattle and supplies, for which the enemy had consequently to depend upon
Canada and remoter England.</p>

<p>Having provided this barrier against the enemy, Schuyler, who had
been joined by Arnold, fell back to Fort Miller with his artillery (brought
from Fort George), where he tarried till he had ruined the road over
which he passed, and thence proceeded to Stillwater to await reinforcements,
making that his fortified headquarters, while his little army occupied
a camp, which was intrenched on Van Schaick's Island, near the mouth of
the Mohawk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Burgoyne was so elated by his successes that he dispatched his aide-de-camp
Captain Gardner to England, "with news so important to the king's
service, and so honorable to the troops under his command." But while
the British colors were flying over Ticonderoga, he little dreamed of the
difficulties and reverses which were awaiting him. To provide garrisons
for these works in his rear, to which he had sent all his surplus artillery
and baggage, he was compelled "to drain the life-blood of his army", since
Carleton had declined to supply the necessary troops for their defence, on
the ground that his jurisdiction as governor did not extend beyond the
bounds of Canada.</p>

<p>Burgoyne availed himself of the water transportation of Lake George for
most of his artillery and stores; but, for the march of his army from
Skenesborough, a trackless wilderness confronted him, through which he
had to remove countless obstacles, cut a new pathway, and build no less
than forty bridges, one of which, over a swamp, was two miles long. Wood
Creek had also to be opened for his bateaux. In these laborious undertakings
his army was exhausted with overwork, and suffered terribly with
midsummer heat and innumerable insects. Consequently, with his utmost
efforts, he did not reach Fort Edward till July 30th, or twenty-four days after
leaving Lake Champlain, a distance of only twenty-six miles. Burgoyne
remained at Fort Edward till August 15th, awaiting the transportation
across the portage from Lake George of the necessary artillery, ammunition,
provisions, and bateaux for his descent of the Hudson.</p>

<p>During this enforced delay important events were occurring elsewhere,
on the Mohawk and near Bennington. General Lincoln at the same time
was recruiting troops in New England, with which to attempt the recapture
of Ticonderoga and cut off the British retreat to Canada.</p>

<p>Fort Stanwix, or Fort Schuyler as it was subsequently called, on the
head-waters of the Mohawk, near the present Rome, N. Y., was built in
1758, and in April, 1777, was put under command of Colonel Gansevoort,
who, with Colonel Marinus Willet, placed it in a better condition of
defence. The garrison of the work was 750 Continental troops, before
which St. Leger, accompanied by the loyalist Sir John Johnson, and
Joseph Brant the great Mohawk chief, appeared, August 2, and the next
day summoned it to surrender. Gansevoort paying no attention to this,
the British colonel prepared for a regular siege, and sent out detachments
to cut off all succor.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Tryon County were panic-stricken, but the aged General
Herkimer by great efforts collected 800 militia and marched to Oriskany,
within eight miles of the fort, to which he sent a messenger with a
request that upon the messenger's arrival three guns should be fired and
a sortie made to facilitate the advance of the succoring party through the
besiegers. The signal was delayed, and, unfortunately, Herkimer's better
judgment was overruled by his younger officers, who were impatient of
delay. This led to his moving forward and to his being ambushed in a valley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the head of which was held by loyalists, while Indian allies under Brant
occupied the sides. Here a desperate hand-to-hand fight of five hours
ensued, early in which the brave Herkimer was mortally wounded; but
seated upon his saddle, and propped against a tree, he calmly continued to
give his orders and animate his men with his own heroism till the end of
the battle.</p>

<p>At length the long-expected signal guns were heard, when Colonel
Willet with 250 men made a sudden dash upon a weak part of the besiegers'
camp. Though he failed to reach Herkimer, he destroyed two
sections of the enemy's intrenchments, and captured the British camp
equipage, Sir John Johnson's papers, five flags, and some prisoners.</p>

<p>The Indians, who had lost many of their braves at Oriskany, hearing
the sound of Willet's musketry in their rear, quickly retreated, and were
soon followed by the loyalists, leaving Herkimer in possession of the field.
St. Leger still continued the siege of the fort, where now floated for the
first time the American flag, just adopted by Congress, made of alternate
stripes of a soldier's white shirt and a camp-woman's red petticoat, the
field being cut out of an old blue overcoat. Beneath this were hung the
five captured British standards.</p>

<p>St. Leger on the 7th again demanded the surrender of the fort, threatening
Indian vengeance, and falsely stating that Burgoyne was in possession
of Albany. Gansevoort returned an indignant refusal to this disgraceful
threat. Soon came rumors of the approach of the intrepid Arnold
to raise the siege. Statements sent forward of his numbers, purposely exaggerated,
caused the flight of the panic-stricken Indians, and St. Leger,
August 22, abandoned his trenches, some artillery and camp equipage,
and fled to Canada. The right wing of the invaders being thus paralyzed,
Arnold returned in triumph to join Schuyler.</p>

<p>Burgoyne's difficulties increased. His Indian allies were insubordinate,
and the patriots swelled the American ranks. Finding that his scanty
supplies had to be replenished from his distant base in Canada, or rather
from England, he decided to make a raid upon Bennington, to secure
horses, cattle, and provisions from the depot there. He hoped also that
this move would strike terror among the unfriendly inhabitants of the New
Hampshire Grants, who hung "like a gathering storm upon his left", and
also would elevate the flagging spirits of his army, by a victory which he
supposed would be easy. Accordingly, Lieutenant-Colonel Baum was dispatched
with a select corps of 550 British, German, and loyalist troops
and 150 Indians. Colonel Breyman, with 642 heavy dismounted Brunswick
chasseurs, was sent on the 15th as a support. To oppose this expedition,
General John Stark hastily collected 1,400 trained militia.</p>

<p>Though constant skirmishing took place on the 15th, a pouring rain
prevented a general engagement till the next day, when the determined
Yankee leader declared he would beat the invader or "before night Molly
Stark would be a widow." To fulfil his pledge he seized the initiative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
attacked the enemy on three sides, stormed their intrenchments on the
Walloomscoick River and captured their guns, dispersed the Indians and
loyalists, and went in hot pursuit of the Germans and British, when his
exhausted forces were checked by Breyman's supporting detachment.
Colonel Warner's excellent regiment, at once fresh and eager, arrived that
afternoon and renewed the action, which was continued till dark, when
Breyman, under the cover of night, made good
his retreat. Baum was mortally wounded, 207
men were killed, 700 were captured, including the
wounded; and 1,000 stand of small arms, all the
enemy's artillery and most of their baggage fell
into the hands of the Americans. Had there
been another hour of daylight, none would have
escaped. Stark's losses were 40 killed and 42
wounded.</p>

<p>This victory and the success in the Mohawk valley
were as inspiriting to the American as depressing
to the Anglo-German army. Burgoyne was
now beset with danger on every side. Formidable
obstacles accumulated in his path, famine stared
him in the face; all his English flour and beef
had been consumed, and the whole surrounding
country was sending enthusiastic volunteers to bar
his progress.</p>

<p>Nearly a month before, Washington had predicted
that Burgoyne's successes "would precipitate his
ruin", and that his "acting in detachments was the course of all others
most favorable to the American cause", as cutting off any of them "would
inspirit the people and do away with much of their present anxiety." The
beginning of the end had already come.</p>

<p>The first stage in this eventful campaign was for Burgoyne a great success;
the second was an equally great failure; and now the last was coming,
in which the most decisive results and the highest plaudits were to be won
or lost. Schuyler unquestionably would have been the hero of this final
development had he not most inopportunely been replaced by Gates, a mediocre
soldier. Fortunately, the latter's deficiencies were compensated by
officers inferior in rank but superior in ability,&mdash;the dashing Arnold, the
daring Morgan, not to name others.</p>

<p>Congress, in the exercise of its prerogative, made and displaced generals
at its will, and too often was influenced by sectional interests and
rivalries. The command of the Northern Department was especially the
prize of party favorites. Wooster, Thomas, Sullivan, Schuyler, and Gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
had in rapid succession followed each other, and now Schuyler, after all he
had done to baffle the enemy and organize victory, was to be the victim
of prejudice&mdash;of New England against New York&mdash;which dated back to
colonial days. Schuyler placed little reliance upon New England troops,
and their representatives in Congress had as little confidence in Schuyler's
generalship.</p>

<p>Each misjudged the other; but the outcome of this feeling
between Dutch and Puritan blood
was unfortunate in superseding
the soldierly Schuyler by the intriguing
Gates. And it was a
cruel reverse to the former, just
as his skilful plans were culminating
in the utter discomfiture
of the enemy, and his successes
at Stanwix and Bennington were
bringing reinforcements from
every quarter to his standard
with which to take the offensive,
that he should be shorn of the
laurels which were about to
crown him as the brilliant leader
in this most important campaign
of the Revolution. If Schuyler
had been left in command, probably
all the after-complications
connected with Burgoyne's surrender
would have been avoided.</p>

<p>The resolution of Congress
superseding Schuyler reached
him on the 10th of August. The
noble patriot responded to this
ungenerous censure by renewed efforts for his army till Gates's arrival on
the 19th, and then he extended to his unworthy successor the courtesy
of a true gentleman, for with him the country's welfare was paramount to
all personal wrongs.</p>

<p>Gates, clothed with plenary powers and granted by Congress almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
everything denied to Schuyler, moved, after a delay of three weeks, with
his army, 6,000 strong, from the mouth of the Mohawk to Bemis's Heights,
a commanding position on the west bank of the Hudson, which was selected
by Arnold and fortified by the engineer Kosciusko. The principal hill was
occupied on three sides by extensive intrenchments and redoubts with an
abatis. A line of breastworks on the east extended from the hill to the
Hudson, to guard a floating bridge across the river and to sweep the plain
in front; and on the west was a lower hill which was only partially fortified.
The whole position was covered by a ravine in front, through which flowed
a branch of Mill Creek.</p>

<p>Gates took personal command of the right wing of the army, occupying
the intrenchments between the Hudson and the heights to the west;
Learned held the centre; while Arnold had charge of the left wing,
comprising Morgan's riflemen, some Continental troops, and a body of
militia.</p>

<p>To coöperate in checking the advance of the enemy, General Lincoln
with 2,000 militia was sent to threaten Burgoyne's communications. Colonel
Brown with 500 of Lincoln's force, on September 18th, surprised the outposts
and key-points of Ticonderoga, destroyed over two hundred bateaux
and gunboats, captured 293 prisoners and 5 cannon, released 100 Americans,
and brought away the Continental standard left flying over the fort
when abandoned by St. Clair.</p>

<p>Burgoyne was greatly perplexed. To retreat was to acknowledge his
weakness, and to advance was possibly to sacrifice his army and lose his
coveted peerage. Under these circumstances he stood still, hoping his
recent defeats would soon be forgotten, and he should be strengthened for
the future.</p>

<p>Having finally received from Lake George his artillery, military stores,
and thirty days' provisions, Burgoyne crossed to the west bank of the
Hudson; September 13th-14th, he moved with his army to Saratoga; on
the 15th-16th he tarried at Dovegot (near Coveville) to reconnoitre, repair
bridges, and open roads over this rugged country; on the 17th he marched
to Sword's Farm; on the 18th he advanced to Wilbur's Basin, within two
miles of the American position, having constantly to skirmish with Arnold;
and on the morning of the 19th he was engaged in reconnoitring and
making preparations to attack Gates, if deemed expedient.</p>

<p>A table-land, intersected with ravines through which flowed Mill Creek
and its branches, separated the two armies. Except a narrow cultivated
strip, adjoining the Hudson, the ground was covered in great part by a
dense forest. The river formed its eastern boundary, and on the north,
west, and south sides were wooded heights, separated from each other by
valleys.</p>

<p>While the Americans occupied the south heights, the Anglo-German
army made ready to take possession of those on the north, and then to
turn the western hills, thus to get in rear of the American left by a flank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
movement of their right, while their centre attacked in front and was supported
by their left.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock on the morning of the 19th, Burgoyne's army advanced
in three columns. He, in person, in command of the centre column,
moved towards Freeman's Farm, opposite to the American left; Riedesel
and Phillips with a large train of artillery, forming the left column, followed
the river road, and, after the attack had begun, turned westward to
support and prolong the line of battle of the deployed centre; while, by a
circuitous march, Fraser, with Breyman's German riflemen, having his
flanks covered by Canadians, loyalists, and Indians, moved with the right
column, taking post westward of the centre, thus greatly overlapping the
American left, which it was designed to turn and rout.</p>

<p>Gates, called by Burgoyne "an old midwife", impassively looked on,
giving no orders and evincing no desire to fight, while the impatient Arnold,
foreseeing the enemy's movement to turn his left, sent Morgan's riflemen
and some of Dearborn's light infantry to check it. They rushed upon the
enemy, and dispersed the Canadians and Indians; but following up their
success too eagerly, they soon encountered the British line of battle, and
were overpowered by superior numbers. This being reported to Gates, the
Continental troops were sent to support Morgan, but the entire force
proved insufficient to cope with and counteract Fraser's movement. Arnold,
undismayed, then changed his direction, and fell suddenly upon the
enemy's centre with a view of separating Burgoyne from Fraser. The
battle was waged with great fury by both antagonists, and as each received
reinforcements the conflict deepened, and, with varying success, became
more and more stubborn. Burgoyne finally escaped defeat by the timely
coming up of Riedesel with Pausch's artillery. After this death-struggle of
four hours' duration, darkness terminated the contest. The Americans
fell back in good order to their intrenchments, while the Anglo-German
army, lying on their arms, retained the barren field of their foiled efforts to
advance. Though both sides claimed the victory, neither had triumphed
at "Freeman's Farm." It was in reality a drawn battle. The forces engaged
in the conflict were nearly equal, the Americans having about 3,000
and the enemy nearly 3,500 of their best troops. The loss of the former
was 65 killed, 218 wounded, and 38 missing; while that of the latter, according
to their own authorities, was about 600 killed and wounded. British
bayonets and abundant artillery were fully matched by American rifles,
without a single piece of ordnance. Had Arnold been properly reinforced
by Gates, he might have broken the enemy's line and have gained a complete
victory.</p>

<p>Gates's army was confident and jubilant as to the issue of the campaign,
Burgoyne's anxious and despondent; while both generals strengthened their
positions, and their camps resounded with "dreadful note of preparation"
for a coming conflict.</p>

<p>The quarrel which had been brewing between Gates and Arnold, growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
out of former jealousy and the supersedure of Schuyler, ripened into
open hostility. The crisis of the feud came when Gates failed in his
official report to make any mention of Arnold's personal participation in
the battle of Freeman's Farm. Thereupon a violent altercation ensued,
resulting in Arnold being relieved of his command and excluded from
headquarters.</p>

<p>Though
unemployed, he continued
with the army, the
officers of his division
begging him not to leave
them, as another battle
was impending.</p>

<p>The two armies confronted
each other within
cannon-shot, and scarcely
a night passed without
some contest between
pickets or foraging parties.
Burgoyne, anxiously
awaiting news of Sir
Henry Clinton's coöperation
from New York, tenaciously
held his ground,
though living upon half
rations. Gates in the
mean time supinely
rested in his camp, awaiting
the day when the
ripened fruit of Schuyler's
skill, in retarding the
enemy's march and cutting
off his detachments,
should fall at his feet, and Burgoyne be compelled to starve or pass
under the Caudine Forks.</p>

<p class="p2">Sir Henry Clinton, having been reinforced from England, left New York,
October 3, with a large fleet and 3,000 troops, to effect the long-expected
junction with Burgoyne. On the 5th he reached Verplanck's Point, on
the Hudson River, from which he made a feint upon Peekskill. Having
by this ruse deceived the aged Putnam, in command of the Hudson Highlands,
Clinton crossed with his main body on the 6th to King's Ferry,
and, by following a circuitous route around the Dunderberg Mountain, the
British general in the afternoon carried by assault the feebly garrisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
but bravely defended Forts Montgomery and Clinton. The enemy's fleet
then destroyed the boom and chain across the river, forced the Americans
to burn two frigates, which could not escape, and ended their excursion up
the Hudson at Esopus (now Kingston) by laying it in ashes and returning
to New York, it being too late to save Burgoyne.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="p2">The American army, after the battle of Freeman's Farm, was daily growing
stronger in men and fortifications, while the Anglo-German force was
constantly becoming weaker and
worn out by watching and incessant
alarms. Burgoyne's situation
was critical, for he could
neither advance nor retreat with
safety, and to stand still was to
starve. Already the loyalists and
Canadians were deserting in numbers,
and his Indians, having little
opportunity for plundering
and scalping, were abandoning
him altogether.</p>

<p>Receiving no tidings from Sir
Henry Clinton, Burgoyne determined
to make an armed reconnoissance
of the American left
on the 7th of October, and attack
the next day, should there
be a reasonable prospect of success;
if not, to fall back on the
11th behind the Batten-Kill.</p>

<p>Accordingly, leaving proper
guards for his camp, Burgoyne in person, at ten <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> of the 7th, with 1,500
choice troops and ten pieces of artillery, moved out for the contemplated
reconnoissance, which was at the same time to cover a foraging party to
gather wheat for the pressing necessities of his army. His troops were
formed in three columns, and when within three quarters of a mile of the
American left were deployed in line of battle upon open ground behind a
screen of dense forest. Fraser, with 500 picked men, formed the right,
ready to fall upon Gates's left; Riedesel, with his Brunswickers, held the
centre; Phillips was in charge of the British left; while the Indians,
rangers, and provincials were to work their way through the woods to
gain the left and rear of the American camp, in which Lincoln then commanded
the right, and Gates had taken Arnold's place on the left.</p>

<p>So soon as the enemy moved and the foragers were at work, Gates ordered
out Morgan. Divining Burgoyne's intention, Morgan was to seize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the high ground on the enemy's right by making a wide sweep; Learned
was to hold the German centre in check; and Poor, with his brigade of Continentals
and some militia, concealed by the woods, was to assail the British
left. Poor, supported by Learned, opened the battle at half past two with
great fury against Major Acland's grenadiers, and extended his blows to
Riedesel's centre; Morgan and Dearborn almost simultaneously fell like a
thunderbolt upon the enemy's right.</p>

<p>Burgoyne, seeing the danger of Fraser's right being turned, ordered him
to fall back to a new position, in doing which Fraser was mortally wounded
by one of Morgan's sharpshooters. In the mean time, Poor was playing
wild havoc with Acland's grenadiers, captured Phillips's artillery after killing
nearly all of its gunners, and then turned their own pieces upon the
British, putting the entire left of their army to flight.</p>

<p>The Germans still firmly held their ground in the centre, when Arnold,
maddened by his wrongs, dashed wildly into the thickest of the fight, without
authority assumed command of his old division, with audacity and judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
led regiment after regiment to the attack at different points, roused
his troops to the highest enthusiasm, and forced back by his impetuous assaults
the already shattered British line, which Burgoyne then courageously
led in person. But all of the British commander's determination was of
little avail, his entire forces being driven back into their intrenched camp.
Here the wreck of the Anglo-German army made a firm stand; but Arnold
still sought new dangers. With desperation he and his fearless followers
mounted embankments and abatis to assail Balcarras, then dashed upon the
strong works of the German camp, and ceased not his furious onsets till
the whole of the enemy's fortified position lay open, when night closed the
scene.</p>

<p>The American army in this decisive battle lost 50 killed and 150 wounded,
including among the latter the dauntless Arnold. The enemy, besides nine
guns, a large supply of ammunition, and much baggage, lost 176 killed, about
250 wounded, and some 200 prisoners. Among those who lost their lives
were the gallant Fraser and the sturdy Breyman, and included in the wounded
were several British officers of high rank.</p>

<p>Burgoyne, signally defeated and exposed to a new attack by double his
fighting force, prudently retreated, on the stormy night of the 8th, to Saratoga,
leaving behind his sick, wounded, and everything he could possibly
spare. General Fraser was buried, as he had requested, in a large redoubt
near the Hudson, the guns fired over his grave being the American artillery
aimed at the group of distinguished mourners before knowing the occasion
of their assembling.</p>

<p>Gates, who had not been personally engaged in either battle of his army,
remained two days with his main body in the abandoned camp of the enemy
at Wilbur's Basin, he judiciously having sent detachments to take advantageous
positions to hem in Burgoyne. On the 11th, Gates ordered his
main body to cross the Fishkill, supposing Burgoyne had further retreated;
but his advanced guard of 1,500 men under Nixon quickly withdrew, having
discovered the enemy intrenched and in battle array on the other side of
the stream.</p>

<p>Burgoyne, now finding himself exposed to the concentric fire of the Americans,
who nearly surrounded him, and having no opening through which to
retreat to Lake George or to Lake Champlain, called a council of war to
deliberate upon his desperate situation. "By their unanimous concurrence
and advice", says he, "I was induced to open a treaty with Major-General
Gates." At ten <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> of the 14th, a flag of truce was sent by Burgoyne, asking
for a parley, during which Gates demanded an unconditional surrender
of the enemy's troops as prisoners of war. This proposition Burgoyne peremptorily
refused to entertain. Hostilities in the mean time were suspended,
and modified proposals were made. After two days' delay, Gates, hearing
of Sir Henry Clinton's advance up the Hudson, and fearing that he might
reach Albany, agreed upon the terms, dictated by Burgoyne, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Anglo-German troops to march out of their camp with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
honors of war, and their artillery to be moved to the bank of the Hudson
River, and there left, together with the soldiers' arms, which were to be
piled at the word of command from their own officers. It was further
agreed that a free passage to Great Britain should be granted to the troops
on condition of their not serving again in the present contest; that all
officers should retain their baggage and side-arms, and not be separated
from their men; and that all, of whatever country they might be, following
the camp, should be included in the terms of capitulation. Before
signing the treaty, Burgoyne demurred to designate it as a <i>capitulation</i>,
whereupon Gates readily consented to its being called a <span class="smcap">Treaty of Convention</span>,
and as such it was signed October 16, 1777.</p>

was simply attired in a plain blue coat. Reining up their horses, Burgoyne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>

<p>On the site of old Fort Hardy the Anglo-German army, October 17,
grounded their arms at the command of their own officers, none of the
American troops being present to witness this humiliation of the enemy.
In the afternoon the captured troops crossed the Hudson, and, escorted by
a company of light dragoons, were marched between the parallel lines of
American soldiers, preceded by two officers, unfurling "the stars and
stripes" just adopted by Congress. While this ceremony took place in
the presence of Burgoyne and Gates, the former drew his sword and presented
it to the latter, which being received was courteously returned,
when both generals retired into Gates's tent.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>While the prisoners, under guard of General Heath, were marching to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Boston, Gates hurried to Albany to oppose any movement of Sir Henry
Clinton; and Major Wilkinson was sent to Congress to communicate the
joyful tidings of Burgoyne's surrender. Rejoicings were heard throughout
the United States, and the successful general was so elated and his vanity
so stimulated that he aspired to supplant Washington, as he had Schuyler.</p>

<p class="p2">A few criticisms upon the plan of the campaign of 1777, and the mode
of conducting it, may be permitted. The British cabinet wisely decided
upon the seizure of the Hudson as the most efficient way of breaking the
power of the revolted colonies; but, in carrying out its design, it violated
a fundamental maxim of war. No principle of strategy is better established
than the superiority of <i>interior</i> as against <i>exterior</i> lines of operation
of armies, as was so admirably illustrated in the "Seven Years'
War." Frederic the Great, without any frontier barriers and open to
attack on all sides, from his central position kept at bay France, Austria,
Russia, Saxony, Sweden, and the Germanic body, whose united population
was over twenty times as great as that of Prussia, including Silesia, a
recently conquered province. In like manner, the Americans, in July,
1777, were within a great circle,&mdash;Schuyler on the upper Hudson, Putnam
at the Highlands, and Washington in New Jersey, within supporting distance
of each other; while the British armies were widely separated upon
its vast circumference,&mdash;St. Leger moving to the upper Mohawk, Burgoyne
from Canada, Clinton at New York, and Howe sailing to the Chesapeake.</p>

<p>In the struggle for the Hudson, the two independent British armies&mdash;one
in Canada and the other in New York&mdash;were expected to coöperate
in order to attain a common object, while Burgoyne with the one was tied
down by fixed orders, and Clinton with the other had no instructions as to
the part he was expected to perform. Besides, their bases were separated
by about four hundred miles of wild, hostile, and thinly populated country,
rendering intercommunication so difficult that, of ten messengers sent out
by different routes to Howe, not one returned to Burgoyne.</p>

<p>No precaution was taken to provide for the losses of Burgoyne's army,
nor to supply the necessary drafts upon it to garrison the posts in his rear,
guarding his communications with Canada. When he gained possession
of Ticonderoga, he called upon Sir Guy Carleton to furnish the necessary
force to hold the place; but Carleton did not feel justified, under his precise
orders, to send troops beyond his jurisdiction. Consequently, Burgoyne
"drained the life-blood of his force" in the field to provide for the defence
of this and other works left behind.</p>

<p>Burgoyne's <i>logistics</i>, or means of supplying and moving his army, were
very defective. Not till June 7, 1777, a month after his arrival in Canada,
did he make provision for the transportation of either stores or artillery,
and then his arrangements were so entirely inadequate that they seemed
based upon the assumption that his adversary was his inferior in all military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
qualities. Hence, he decided "to trust to the resources of the expedition
for the rest", while for his own personal baggage he used no less than
"<i>thirty carts</i>." Most of his provisions had to be brought from England, a
distance of 3,600 miles; some from Canada; and for the rest he relied
upon the meagre resources of the hostile country he was to traverse.
Consequently his army was often on reduced rations, sometimes nearly
starving, and finally, to secure its existence, he undertook his disastrous
raid upon Bennington.</p>

<p>After the pursuit of St. Clair, Burgoyne should have returned with his
army to Ticonderoga, and taken the water route by Lake George, instead
of forcing his way through an obstructed wilderness to Fort Edward, which
he did not reach till July 30th, nor leave till August 14th. Had Schuyler
directed Burgoyne's operations he could not have planned measures more
conducive to his own advantage. On the Lake George route were only
two small armed schooners to oppose any resistance, and from the head of
the lake was a direct road to Albany, which had been followed by Abercrombie
and Amherst. As it was, Burgoyne was compelled to send his
supplies and artillery by the lake, and then carry them over the portage to
Fort Edward, which consumed more time than would have been necessary
to move in light marching order direct to Albany. General De Peyster,
a careful student of this campaign, says: "Burgoyne could have been reassembled
at 'Old Ty' by the 10th July; could have been transported to
Fort George by the 12th; and, having left his heavy guns and all but his
light artillery and indispensable materials there or at Ty, in depot, with a
sufficient guard, could have reached Fort Edward on the evening of the
13th July. From this point to Albany is about fifty miles. With six or
ten days' rations and an extra supply of ammunition sufficient for a battle
of that period, Burgoyne could have swept Schuyler out of his path with
ease, and, allowing one day's delay for a fight, could have occupied Albany
on the 16th July." But the British commander had proclaimed, "This
army must not retreat." Though he subsequently tried to palliate his
mistake, all his correspondence shows that pride in carrying out his declaration,
not military principles, made him persevere in the false movement
which lost him the campaign, and secured in the end American independence.</p>

<p>Burgoyne, after his brilliant success at the opening of the campaign,
suddenly relapsed into the sluggishness of his German allies. Instead of
rapidly pursuing his demoralized foe, he tarried at Skenesborough till his
pathway was thoroughly obstructed and the fugitives had recovered from
their panic. After he had lost his prestige and the Americans had gained
confidence by success at Stanwix and Bennington, he attempted with
diminished forces to cope with the growing strength of his opponent.
Thus, by delay, he lost in September what he might have achieved in July.
From his arrival at Skenesborough till he had reached his southernmost
point at Freeman's Farm, he moved only <i>fifty miles in seventy-four days</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Slow in all his movements, Burgoyne's tardiness was increased by his
large and superfluous train of artillery which accompanied all his toilsome
marches. Even when he required the greatest celerity, he chose for his
raid upon Bennington, not the nimble-footed light infantry under the
dashing Fraser, but cumbrous dismounted German dragoons moving only
a mile and a third an hour.</p>

<p>Burgoyne was not only slow, but he was irresolute. After his disastrous
defeat at Bemis's Heights he lost five precious days in fatal indecision
while retreat was possible. On October 12th his last chance had passed, he
then being completely invested by the Americans, and nothing was left to
him but surrender. According to Madame Riedesel, he had given in this
crisis of his fate more attention to his mistress than to his army. Aspasia
had triumphed over Mars.</p>

<p>While Burgoyne committed many blunders, his opponents had their
shortcomings also. The fortifications of Ticonderoga, after falling into the
hands of the Americans, were too much extended for their defence by a
moderate garrison; but the most fatal error was the failure to occupy
Mount Defiance, which completely commanded all the American works,
and, when seized by the British, left St. Clair no alternative but hasty
retreat and the abandonment of much artillery and considerable supplies.
The fugitives then counted largely on the delay of their pursuers, who
followed them with celerity, severely punishing them at Skenesborough
and Hubbardton.</p>

<p>Congress committed the most criminal error, outweighing all others, in
substituting, at the most critical moment of the campaign, a military charlatan
for an accomplished soldier,&mdash;in supplanting Schuyler, who was
the organizer of the victories, by Gates, who "had no fitness for command
and wanted personal courage." To say nothing of the difference in merit
of the two commanders, the time for making the change was most inopportune.</p>

<p>Putnam, a brave officer but no general, managed things so badly in the
Highlands that Forts Montgomery and Clinton were lost, and the Hudson
was opened to the enemy whenever he chose to advance.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE titles alone of the numerous works which have been consulted in the preparation
of the foregoing narratives would fill many of these pages. Therefore, to avoid
repetition, as most of them are common to all the chapters of this History of the American
Revolution, reference will be made only to those authorities which have a bearing
upon disputed points, or to newly discovered facts respecting the "Struggle for the
Hudson."</p>

<p>Of the many authors who have written of the New York campaign of 1776, nearly all
have followed the narrations given in Sparks's <i>Washington</i> and in the official despatches
of the various officers engaged. For topographical details we have relied upon Des Barres'
<i>Atlantic Neptune</i> (1780-81), with its plans of battles, sieges, etc., and maps of the seat of
war, and upon the recent Coast Survey charts. Local historians have supplied many minor
particulars, which need not be enumerated, except, perhaps, the one relating to the
treason of William Demont, already referred to in the text. Much new light has been
thrown upon the Burgoyne campaign by works published within the last few years.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>One of the most earnestly disputed points of Burgoyne's campaign is whether Arnold
was personally engaged with the enemy at the battle of Freeman's Farm, on Sept. 19, 1777.
Some authorities, notably Bancroft, while admitting that Arnold's troops were in the thickest
of the fray, deny that the general himself was on the battlefield; while Stedman,
Irving, Stone, and many others, equally competent to weigh the facts, maintain that
Arnold was the conquering hero of the fight, and that, but for him, Burgoyne would have
marched straight on to Albany.</p>

<p>Just after Gates had superseded Schuyler in the command of the Northern army, Arnold
had returned from the Mohawk valley flushed with success and impatient to win new laurels.
He was incessantly engaged in skirmishing with the enemy and adding to his reputation
as a brilliant, dashing officer. Gates was envious of Arnold's growing fame, and
resentful of his partiality for Schuyler. Hence arose a coolness towards Arnold, which
rapidly ripened into bitter hostility. That the action of Freeman's Farm, a five hours' battle,
full of skilful movements, was purely a series of chance operations without a guiding
spirit, is utterly preposterous. As Gates was not engaged, whose was the directing mind
but Arnold's, the second in command?</p>

<p>It seems impossible that one devoid of fear, brave even to rashness, who even courted
danger at the risk of death, and one too who was filled with ambition and love of military
glory, could possibly have allowed his command to go into action without leading its
movements and sharing its perils. His subsequent heroism amid the carnage of battle at
Bemis's Heights would seem a sufficient refutation of the charge that he who was always
in the thickest of the fight was only a looker-on while the conflict of September 19th was
raging around Freeman's Farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Gates, in his official report of the battle of Freeman's Farm, makes no mention of Arnold
being engaged; and his adjutant-general, Wilkinson, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, written long after
Arnold's good name had been blasted by his treason, says: "Not a single general officer
was on the field of battle on the 19th of September, until evening, when General Learned
was ordered out."</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, the testimony of the commander-in-chief and his adjutant-general
would be considered conclusive; but it must be borne in mind that both of these
officers were inimical to Arnold, that neither was personally engaged in the battle, and
that the wooded character of the ground precluded either from following any one's movements
through the conflict.</p>

<p>On the other side, we have the contemporary testimony of officers present on the battlefield,
newspaper accounts of the time, and Arnold's own division order of the day after the
battle, in which he speaks of the zeal and spirit of the company officers engaged, in a manner
which none but a close observer could notice. Besides, we have the direct evidence
of two of Arnold's staff officers&mdash;Colonels Livingston and Varick&mdash;that their chief was
the hero of the battle of Freeman's Farm; the former warmly lauding "his conduct during
the late action", and declaring that "to him alone is due the honor of our late victory."
Even the enemy's chief, Burgoyne, said in the British House of Commons: "Mr. Gates
had determined to receive the attack in his lines. Mr. Arnold, who commanded on the
left, foreseeing the danger of being turned, advanced without consultation with his general,
and gave instead of receiving battle."</p>

<p>Another much-disputed point is whether to Schuyler or Gates is chiefly due the triumph
of our arms in the Burgoyne campaign. Bancroft, in his <i>History of the United States</i> (vol.
ix. ch. 21, orig. ed.), states that Schuyler lacked military talents, failed to harry the advance
of Burgoyne, wanted personal courage, and had no influence with the people. All these
charges have been triumphantly refuted by his grandson and by his biographer.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

<p>General Schuyler's zeal, energy, ability, and sterling virtues have been so fully set forth
in the preceding narrative of the Burgoyne campaign that any amplification here is needless;
but it may be proper to add the testimony of some of our most distinguished countrymen
as to the merits of this true gentleman, noble soldier, and patriotic Fabian hero.
Chief Justice Marshall says: "In this gloomy state of things no officer could have exerted
more diligence and skill than Schuyler." Chancellor Kent writes: "In acuteness of intellect,
profound thought, indefatigable activity, exhaustless energy, pure patriotism, and persevering
and intrepid public efforts, Schuyler had no superior." Daniel Webster said:
"I consider Schuyler as second only to Washington in the services he rendered to the
country in the war of the Revolution. His zeal and devotion to the cause under difficulties
which would have paralyzed the efforts of most men, and his fortitude and courage
when assailed by malicious attacks upon his public and private character, <i>every one of
which was proved to be false</i>, have impressed me with a strong desire to express publicly
my sense of his great qualities."</p>

<p>Washington, Hamilton, Jay, Jefferson, and most of the great men of the Revolution
had unbounded confidence in Schuyler; and modern historians, such as Irving, Sparks,
Lossing, and others, bear like testimony to his virtues and services. Even Congress,
which had so unjustly removed Schuyler from his command, when convinced of its error,
would not consent to his resignation from the army till he persistently demanded it.
Though Schuyler's military career did not sparkle with "feats of broil and battle", he
exhibited those great qualities which are as conducive to the success of war as "the magnificently
stern array" of arms in the heady fight. He was ready in expedients to foil the
enemy, skilful and persevering in executing them, and resolute and untiring till his end
was obtained. Never discouraged by disaster, and stimulated to higher effort as fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
frowned, he continued sanguine of success in the darkest hour of adversity. Every assault
upon his reputation fell harmless before his invulnerable patriotism; no injustice could
swerve him from the path of honor; and to him, as to all true men, the meaning of life
was concentrated in the single word <span class="smcap">Duty</span>.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Disposal of the Convention Troops.</span><a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>&mdash;In
accordance with Article IV. of the convention,
the captured army was marched, under
guard of General Glover, to the neighborhood
of Boston, where it arrived about Nov. 6th. The
British troops were barracked on Prospect Hill
and the German troops on Winter Hill, the
officers being quartered in Cambridge and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
neighboring towns. Much complaint was made
of the character and insufficiency of their accommodations,
but considering the limited supply
of houses at the disposal of General Heath,
commanding the Eastern department, he did
the best in his power, without the aid of the
State of Massachusetts, to whose Council he
appealed for the use of "at least one of the
colleges" for their comfort. At the worst, however,
these captives fared far better than our
own troops at Valley Forge during that winter.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<p>Under Article V. supplies were to be furnished
to Burgoyne's army "at the same rates."
This was interpreted by Congress, Dec. 19th, to
mean "that the accounts of all provisions and
other necessaries which already have been or
which hereafter may be supplied by the public
to prisoners in the power of these States shall
be discharged by either receiving from the British
Commissary of Prisoners, or any of his
agents, provisions or other necessaries, equal
in quality and kind to what had been supplied,
or the amount thereof in gold or silver."</p>

<p>Exacting provisions <i>in kind</i>, though inconvenient
to the British commissary, was not unreasonable,
considering their scarcity; but the
condition that expenditures made in depreciated
Continental money should be liquidated, dollar
for dollar, in gold and silver, was a hard one.
As a justification for this latter requirement, it
was stated by Congress "that General Howe
had required that provisions should be sent in
for the subsistence of the American prisoners
in his possession, and that for the purchase of
such necessaries he had forbidden the circulation
of the currency of the States within such
parts as are subject to his power."</p>

<p>By Article II. General Howe was authorized
to send transports to Boston to receive the
troops for their conveyance to England. For
its failure to carry out the obligation imposed
upon it by its own general, the American government,
through Congress, justified itself by
claiming that Burgoyne had already evaded the
provisions of Article I. of the convention. Bancroft,
in his <i>History of the United States</i>, contends
that it had been broken by Burgoyne at
the time of the surrender, by the concealment
of the military chest and other public property,
of which the United States were thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
defrauded.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> He therefore sustains Congress in
its subsequent demand for the descriptive lists
"of all persons comprehended in the surrender",
and the postponing of the embarkation of
Burgoyne's army "until his capitulation should
be expressly confirmed by Great Britain."</p>

<p>On the other side are many high authorities,
among whom is Dr. Charles Deane, who, Oct.
22, 1877, made an exhaustive report upon the
subject of the Convention of Saratoga to the
American Antiquarian Society. He contends
that the acts of Congress "were not marked by
the highest exhibition of good policy or of good
faith."<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p>Fair inferences, from the facts in evidence,
lead to the belief that neither party was scrupulous
in carrying out its obligations. Burgoyne,
after a preliminary agreement to the
terms of the convention, <i>was in favor of breaking
the treaty</i>, because, before affixing his signature
to it, he had heard of the success of Sir
Henry Clinton in the Hudson Highlands. He
was willing, therefore, to barter his plighted
promise to further his own interest, and actually
submitted to a council of his officers "whether
it was consistent with public faith, and if so, expedient,
to suspend the execution of the treaty,
and trust to events." To the honor of the officers
of the Anglo-German army, a decided majority
of the council overruled the wishes of the
general-in-chief, whereupon Burgoyne, Oct. 17,
signed the convention.</p>

<p>Its second article stipulated that "a free passage
be granted to the army, under Lieutenant-General
Burgoyne, to Great Britain, on condition
of not serving again in North America during
the present contest." It seems almost incredible
that even Gates could have been guilty of
such fatuity in sacrificing by this article all the
fruits of the past campaign, and jeoparding
American independence. It would have been
better to have disarmed and disbanded these demoralized
troops on the spot. He could thus
have saved the country much anxiety, inconvenience,
and expense, in guarding, housing, and caring
for them till rested from their fatigues and
embarked for England, where they could be exchanged
for an army of fresh troops, which might
cross the ocean in the spring to plague the inventors
of such a stupid compact, or convention.</p>

<p>Burgoyne was not slow to avail himself of a
<i>literal</i> interpretation of words he had designedly
used in drawing up the convention, for we find
him, only three days after the surrender, writing
to his friend, Colonel Phillopson: "I dictated
terms of convention which save the army to the
State for the next campaign."</p>

<p>Was it in the same spirit that Burgoyne carried
out the first article of the convention, by which
his "arms and artillery" were to be left piled on
the banks of the Hudson? By a <i>literal</i> interpretation
this might mean only muskets and cannon,
but certainly such would not be the accepted
military meaning of that article, especially
as it had to be construed in connection
with the sixth article, permitting all officers "to
retain their carriages, bat-horses, and other cattle,
and no baggage to be molested or searched;
Lieutenant-General Burgoyne giving his honor
that there are no public stores secreted therein."
But, notwithstanding all this, Madame Riedesel,
the wife of General Riedesel, says in her journal:
"Now I was forced to consider how I should
safely carry the colors of our German regiments
still further, as we had made the Americans at
Saratoga believe that they were burnt up&mdash;a circumstance
which they at first took in bad part,
though afterwards they tacitly overlooked it.
But it was only the staves that had been burned,
the colors having been thus far concealed. Now
my husband confided to me his secret, and entrusted
me with their still further concealment.
I therefore shut myself in with a right honorable
tailor, who helped me make a mattress in
which we sewed every one of them. Captain
O'Connell, under pretence of some errand, was
dispatched to New York and passed the mattress
off as his bed. He sent it to Halifax, where
we again found it on our passage from New
York to Canada, and where&mdash;in order to ward
off all suspicion in case our ship should be taken&mdash;I
transferred it into my cabin, and slept during
the whole of the remaining voyage to Canada
upon those honorable badges." She truly
called them "honorable badges", for to an army
they are the insignia of nationality and emblems
of power, under which the soldier ventures his
life and reputation.</p>

<p>How was it with the British flags? Burgoyne
stated that they were all left in Canada. But it
happens that one of them was displayed at Ticonderoga
upon the evacuation of that place by
St. Clair; and five of them were captured at
Fort Stanwix from St. Leger, whose detachment
accompanied Burgoyne till just before leaving
Canada upon his great campaign. Further, it
is written in the <i>Historical Record of the Ninth
Regiment</i> that Lieutenant-Colonel Hill, of that
regiment, "being anxious to preserve the colors,
took them off the staves and concealed them in
his baggage, which he was permitted to retain."
Subsequently these colors, hidden among his
baggage, in which Burgoyne had given his honor
that no public property was secreted, Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Hill presented "to George III., who rewarded
his faithful services with the appointment of
aide-de-camp to his Majesty, and the rank of
Colonel in the army."</p>

<p>As Burgoyne was by Article I. allowed to
march to the ground of surrender "with the
honors of war", General Horatio Rogers, with
the sentiment of a true soldier, says in one of
his admirable annotations of <i>Hadden's Journal</i>:
"Had Burgoyne's officers believed that their colors
were not embraced in the terms of the convention,
they would have flung them to the breeze
and proudly marched out under them, as an indication
of how much of their honor they had preserved,
especially when they supposed they were
about to embark for England; for soldiers lay
down their lives for their flags, the loss, surrender,
or concealment of which, save in rare
instances, is synonymous with defeat and humiliation."<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p>Though it appears that all of the accoutrements
and other public property of the Anglo-German
army were not surrendered and a considerable
part was found unserviceable, it is unnecessary
to make a special point of this minor
matter, after presenting the graver delinquencies
on Burgoyne's part.</p>

<p>General Halleck, one of the best authorities
on the Laws of War, in his work on <i>International
Law</i>, says: "The general phrase, 'with
all the honors of war,' is usually construed to
include the right to march with colors displayed,
drums beating, etc.... A capitulation includes
all property in the place not expressly excepted,
and a commander who destroys military stores
or other property after entering into such agreement
not only forfeits all its benefits, but he subjects
himself to severe punishment for his perfidy.
So, after a capitulation for the surrender
of an army in the field, any officer who destroys
his side arms or his insignia of rank deprives
himself of all the privileges of that rank, and
may be treated as a private soldier. The reason
of the rule is manifest. The victor is entitled
to all the honors and benefits of his agreement
the moment it is entered into, and to destroy
colors, arms, etc. thereafter is to deprive
him of his just rights. Such conduct is both
dishonorable and criminal."</p>

<p>Whether the shortcomings of the British general-in-chief
were known to Washington cannot
be determined, but the latter's correspondence
clearly indicates what he believed would be the
action of George III. upon the arrival of the
convention troops in Great Britain. Hence he
writes, November 13, to General Heath: "Policy
and a regard to our own interest are strongly
opposed to our adopting or pursuing any measures
to facilitate their embarkation and passage
home, which are not required of us by the capitulation."<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
Congress, December 17, concurred
in these views, and consequently refused Burgoyne's
application for his army to embark from
Newport or some port on Long Island Sound,
to avoid the long and dangerous winter passage
around Cape Cod of the British transports which
were to receive the troops.</p>

<p>In this, as in all matters involving the success
of the Revolution, Washington was not only
patriotic, but morally right. We had committed
a blunder at Saratoga, but there was no reason
why we should increase the mischievous effect
of it by expediting the enemy's movements from
Boston, and thus add to the danger of our destruction
by enabling him to replace Burgoyne's
troops in America by others they might relieve
elsewhere, in time for the next year's campaign.</p>

<p>Congress had, November 8th, instructed General
Heath to require descriptive lists of all the
convention troops, to secure us against their reappearing
in arms against us during the war.
This Burgoyne resented as impeaching the
honor of his nation, but he subsequently complied
with a measure so essential to our protection.</p>

<p>In Burgoyne's complaint of November 14th regarding
the quarters for his officers and men, he
inadvertently said, "The public faith is broke",
which unguarded expression was at once seized
upon by Congress; when a committee, of which
Francis Lightfoot Lee was chairman, submitted
its report, upon which Congress, then composed
"of but a few members, and all of them not
the most suitable for the station", adopted, January
8, 1778, the following resolutions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, that as many of the cartouch-boxes and
several other articles of military accoutrements annexed
to the persons of the non-commissioned officers
and soldiers included in the Convention of Saratoga
have not been delivered up, the Convention, on the
part of the British army, has not been strictly complied
with.</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, that the refusal of Lieutenant-General
Burgoyne to give descriptive lists of the non-commissioned
officers and privates belonging to his army,
subsequent to his declaration that the public faith was
broke, is considered by Congress in an alarming point
of view; since a compliance with the resolution of
Congress could only have been prejudicial to that
army in case of an infraction of the convention on
their part.</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, that the charge made by Lieutenant-General
Burgoyne, in his letter to Major-General
Gates of the 14th of November, of a breach of the
public faith on the part of these States, is not warranted
by the just construction of any article of the
Convention of Saratoga; that it is a strong indication
of his intention, and affords just ground of fear that
he will avail himself of such pretended breach of the
convention, in order to disengage himself and the
army under him of the obligation they are under to
these United States; and that the security which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
these States have had in his personal honor is thereby
destroyed.</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved, therefore</i>, that the embarkation of Lieutenant-General
Burgoyne and the troops under his
command be suspended till a distinct and explicit
ratification of the Convention of Saratoga shall be
properly notified by the court of Great Britain to Congress."<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Delays followed these resolutions, and finally,
February 3, 1778, General Heath was instructed
that the embarkation of the troops was to be
indefinitely postponed, the transports upon their
arrival to be ordered away from the port of
Boston, and the guard over the prisoners to be
strengthened. General Burgoyne, of course, was
indignant, and offered that, "should any doubt
still subsist that the idea of being released from
the engagement of the convention has been
adopted by any part of the troops", he would
give a further pledge of the faith of every officer
in his command, "provided the suspension is
immediately broken off." This frank offer was
referred to a committee, which reported that in
their opinion it contained nothing "sufficient to
induce Congress to recede from their resolution
of the 8th of January;" and the report was
agreed to March 2, 1778.</p>

<p>This disingenuous resolution of Congress,
"that the embarkation be suspended" until the
happening of some further contingent event, was
returning the poisoned chalice to Burgoyne's
lips, being exactly in keeping with his proposition
submitted, October 15, 1777, to a council of
his officers, "whether it was consistent with
public faith, and if so, expedient, to suspend the
execution of the treaty and trust to events."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding many members had no confidence
in the political integrity of Great Britain,<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>
such holding of the convention troops as
prisoners of war, contrary to the principles of
international law, certainly placed Congress in
a most unfavorable light. Even so distinguished
a member as Richard Henry Lee, writing to
Washington, says: "It is unfortunately too true
that our enemies pay little regard to good faith,
or any obligations of justice and humanity which
render the Convention of Saratoga a matter of
great moment; and it is also, as you justly observe,
an affair of infinite delicacy. The undoubted
advantage they will take even of the
appearance of infraction on our part, and the
American character, which is concerned in preserving
its faith inviolate, cover this affair with
difficulties, and prove the disadvantage we are
under in conducting war against an old, corrupt,
and powerful people, who, having much
credit and influence in the world, will venture on
things that would totally ruin the reputation of
young and rising communities like ours." We
would further remark that the moral standard
of even the most civilized nations was not then
as high as in this more advanced age, and that
upon the construction of this convention hung
the independence of the United States. Napier
said of the Convention of Cintra in 1808: "A
convention implies some weakness, and must
be weighed in <i>the scales of prudence, not those of
justice</i>."</p>

<p>General Burgoyne and his staff were allowed
by Congress to return to England on parole.
Soon after their departure the British troops were
removed to Rutland, Mass., because of fears of
their being rescued by the British forces then
at Newport, R. I. Congress finally directed that
the Convention troops, in order to be more easily
subsisted, should be removed to Charlottesville,
Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> where they arrived in January, 1779,
and they were detained in the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
till the conclusion of peace with Great Britain.
Most of the officers had in the mean time been
exchanged.</p>

<p>Dr. Deane, in concluding his investigation of
this subject, says: "There can be no doubt that
the supreme authority in the State would always
have the right, as it has the power, to revise a
treaty made by its agents, as in the case we have
been considering. This follows from the nature
of sovereignty itself. An Arnold might be
bribed to to capitulate to the enemy. But where
such treaties are entered into in good faith, and
the obvious powers of the commanders have
not been exceeded, the agreements between the
victor and the vanquished are regarded by the
highest authorities as to be sacredly kept. Humanity
demands it; otherwise there would be no
cessation of hostilities till the annihilation of
both belligerents."<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p>While Great Britain had just cause to complain
of the violation of the Convention of Saratoga
by the American Congress, she might ask
herself, did she always observe strict faith with
her revolted colonies.</p>

<p>According to the Articles of Capitulation of
Charleston, S. C., May 12, 1780, the garrison
were allowed some of the honors of war. They
were to march out and deposit their arms between
the canal and the works of the place, but
the drums were not to beat a British march, nor
the colors to be uncased; the Continental troops
and seamen, keeping their baggage, were to remain
prisoners of war until exchanged; the militia
were to be permitted to return to their respective
homes as prisoners on parole, and while
they kept their parole were not to be molested
in their property by the British troops; the citizens
of all descriptions were to be considered as
prisoners on parole, and to hold their property
in the town on the same terms as the militia.</p>

<p>After the capitulation, Sir Henry Clinton sent
out three expeditions and issued three proclamations,
all having in view the subjugation of
South Carolina. The butchery which Tarleton
inflicted is well known; and even the British historian,
Stedman, who was then an officer under
General Clinton, says of it: "The virtue of humanity
was totally forgot." The enemy's detachments,
sent to various parts of the State,
paid little regard to the rights and property of
its inhabitants. Sir Henry, assuming that the
province was already conquered, issued, before
his departure to New York, a proclamation discharging
all the military prisoners, except those
captured in Fort Moultrie and Charleston, from
their parole after June 20, 1780. Thus, without
their own consent, by Clinton's arbitrary fiat,
these paroled persons were converted from their
neutrality into British subjects, and compelled to
take up arms against their neighbors, or, failing
to comply with this enforced allegiance, were
treated as rebels. The Whig inhabitants were
worried, plundered, and murdered by Tories, in
open violation of all British pledges; leading
men were confined in prison-ships; and patriotic
citizens, who had resumed their swords upon
finding all guaranties violated, had their property
sequestrated, and themselves were severely
punished, sometimes with death. The British
rule was truly a reign of terror.</p>

<p>Lord Mahon stigmatizes in the severest language
American faith as utterly derelict in carrying
out the Convention of Saratoga,<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> while of
the sequel of the capitulation of Charleston he
has no holy horror. His only remark is: "<i>Perhaps</i>
these measures exceeded the bounds of
justice; certainly they did the bounds of policy."
This same English historian, in his account of
Arnold's treason, speaks of the death of André
as the "greatest blot" upon the career of Washington.
He contends that it was unjust to arrest
André, because he had a safeguard from Arnold;
and sneers at the twelve distinguished American
generals upon the Board which condemned the
spy, as incompetent plebeians, drawn from "the
plough-handle and from the shop-board." According
to Mahon's fallacious mode of reasoning,
Washington should not only have let André
go free, because protected by the traitor's pass,
but should have given up West Point, its garrison
and arms, to Sir Henry Clinton, as fully
agreed upon by Arnold, the duly constituted
American commander. According to such reasoning,
Judas Iscariot was justified in betraying
the Saviour, because he had been one of the
trusted twelve who sat down to the Last Supper.
The just fate of the spy and betrayer was
the same, except that Judas was his own executioner.</p>

<p>Of the various military conventions, that of
Kloster-Zeven, of September 8, 1757, between
the Duke of Cumberland and Marshal Richelieu,
most resembles that of Saratoga. In both
the victors had the vanquished at their mercy;
in both the terms of surrender, under the circumstances,
were moderate beyond all necessity;
in both the capitulations were unsatisfactory to
the governments concerned; and in both the
treaties were broken from motives of expediency,
frivolous pretexts being used to cover the odium
of bad faith.</p>

<p>George II., as Elector of Hanover, "to clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
himself", says Sir Edward Cust, "from the dishonor
of the convention, disavowed his son's
authority to sign it", recalled him from his command,
and declared that the hero of Culloden
had ruined his father and disgraced himself.
We cannot enter into the reasons assigned by
the British ministry for abrogating this compact,
but they were at the least as invalid as those
used by our Congress in suspending the execution
of the Convention of Saratoga. When the
Hanoverian army, under Prince Ferdinand of
Brunswick, took the field in contravention of
agreement, Marshal Richelieu declared his own
fidelity in keeping the treaty, and that, should
the enemy "commit any act of hostility", he, as
authorized by the laws of war, "would push
matters to the last extremity." The declaration
of the French marshal "was seconded", says
Smollett, the British historian, "by the Count de
Lynar, the Danish ambassador, who had meditated
the Convention of Kloster-Zeven
under direction of his master to save
Hanover from the horrors of war."</p>

<p>The anomalous condition of New York during
the later part of 1775 is shown from the
Tory point of view in Jones's <i>New York during
the Revolution</i>. Rivington's press was destroyed
in Nov., 1775 (<i>N. Y. City Manual</i>, 1868, p. 813).
There was an irruption from New Jersey into
Long Island in Jan., 1776 (Jones, i.  68). In
Feb. the military control appears in Col. David
Waterbury's orderly-book (<i>Mag. of American
Hist.</i>, Dec., 1884, p. 555). Moore gives current
published reports, including Gov. Tryon's proclamation
in March (<i>Diary of the Rev.</i>, i. 216).
During the same month Lee made a report on
the fortifications of the city (<i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>,
1871, p. 354), and Field, in his <i>Battle of Long
Island</i>, traces the measures of Lee to convert
New York into a camp and to root out the Tories
on Long Island.</p>

<p>Stirling had also been exercising command in
New York (Duer's <i>Stirling</i>, 139), and had seized
Gov. Franklin of New Jersey (<i>N. J. Archives</i>,
x. 702). In April, 1776, Putnam arrived with instructions
from Washington (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>,
iii. 337), finding Heath fresh from a review
of the troops (Moore, i. 228).<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>With the arrival of Washington in the middle
of April, 1776, the campaign may be said to
have begun. His batteries soon sent the few
British ships in the harbor down to Sandy Hook,
and Benjamin Tupper, commanding the little
American flotilla, tried to destroy the lighthouse
at that point, June 21.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> Beside the official letters

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>Late in June and early in July Lord Howe's
fleet arrived in the lower harbor, and the troops
were landed on Staten Island.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>The harbor of New York necessarily had more
or less hydrographical treatment in all the early
plans. Before the outbreak of hostilities, this
may be seen, not only in the Des Barres series of
maps, but in the chart of 1764,<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> reproduced in

July 20th.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> Mercer commanded the

<p>Clinton's expeditionary force returned from
Sullivan's Island Aug. 1st, and the active campaign
began when, three weeks later, Howe
moved a large part of his force across from Staten
Island<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> to Gravesend, on Long Island, Aug. 22d,

by Henry P. Johnston</i>, which accompanies his <i>Campaign of 1776</i>, and is based, as he says, on Ratzer's
map of Brooklyn (1767-68) and the United States coast survey. Before daylight on the morning of the 27th,
the British advance under General Grant disturbed the American pickets at the Red Lion, which is near the
westerly angle of the present Greenwood Cemetery area, marked on the plan with a dotted line. As the day
wore on, the conflict pressed between the British at P and Q and the Americans under Stirling and Parsons at
O and N,&mdash;Smallwood's Marylanders holding the extreme right on the water, and Huntington's Connecticut
regiment on the extreme left. Johnston (p. 165) says Stirling's position was between 18th and 20th streets of
the modern Brooklyn, and not as Sparks's map places him, near the Narrows. Meanwhile, a British column at
9 o'clock the previous evening had begun to move from Flatlands, and at 3 the next morning captured an
American patrol at B, and at 6 the British column (marching in this order,&mdash;Clinton, Cornwallis, Percy, Howe)
neared the American advance under Miles at C, who retired; and at 9 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> the British column was at Bedford
and threw out a force to M, which began to attack the American outposts of D (Miles), E (Wyley), and
F (Chester), forcing them to retire upon Sullivan, who commanded the forces of Johnston (H), Hitchcock (J),
and Little (G), with pickets at K,&mdash;all within or near the present limits of Prospect Park, shown by the
dotted line. Threatened by the British flanking column as well as by the Hessians in front, approaching
from Flatbush under Heister with the commands of Von Stirn (S), Von Mirbach (T), and Donop (U), the
Americans, after the capture of Sullivan himself, retreated as best they could across the creek and got within
the lines. The column of the British advancing from Bedford threw out a force under Vaughan towards L to
menace Fort Putnam and that part of the American works, while Cornwallis advancing towards R had a
conflict there round the Cortelyou house at 11.30 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> with Stirling, who was trying to check this rear
attack of the British, while such of his troops as could be controlled retreated from N and O, and, passing
the marsh, crossed the creek (half a dozen or so being drowned), and reached dry land near some redoubts
within the American line of defence. The point A represents the position of the present City Hall of
Brooklyn. Stirling, meanwhile, with Smallwood's Marylanders in danger of being crushed between Cornwallis
and Grant, and foiled in the attempt to reach Fort Box, retreated towards Flatbush, but encountered
in that direction Gen. Heister's Hessians, and gave himself up to that officer.</p>

<p class="pf400">T. W. Field in his monograph, the <i>Battle of Long Island</i>, gives a large plan showing the relations of the
modern streets to the old landmarks, and marking "the natural defensible line, as nearly as it could be authenticated
by documentary and traditionary evidence." Field adds that "the routes of the British were generally
over country roads long since abandoned, and now covered with buildings; but their localities were
accurately surveyed by the author before their traces were lost." Field also says (p. 145) that the American
works were at once levelled by the British, and new ones were erected on interior lines. (Cf. G. W. Greene's
<i>General Greene</i>, i. 159.) These latter lines are shown, as well as the earlier American works, in a <i>Map of
Brooklyn at the time of the Revolution</i>, drawn by Gen. Jeremiah Johnson (Valentine's <i>Manual</i>, 1858). A
rude map by J. Ewing, made Sept., 1776, is given in fac-simile in Johnston's <i>Campaign of 1776</i> (Documents,
p. 50) and in 2d ser. <i>Penna. Archives</i>, x. 194. Dr. Stiles made a rough plan in his diary, which
he based upon a map of the ground and upon the information given him by one who was at Red Hook at
the time. It is given in fac-simile by Johnston (p. 70).</p>

<p class="pf400">The plan in Carrington's <i>Battles</i> (p. 214) is extended enough to illustrate the movements after the British
occupation of New York; that in H. R. Stiles's <i>Brooklyn</i> (vol. i. 250) is an eclectic one, made with care, and
his text attempts to identify the position of the lines and forts in relation to present landmarks. Gordon
acknowledges receiving from Greene a map improved by that general (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, xiii. 25).</p>

<p class="pf400">There are other plans in Marshall's <i>Washington</i> (large and small atlas); Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, iv. 68,
repeated in Duer's <i>Stirling</i> (p. 162); Guizot's <i>Washington</i>; Samuel Ward's lecture on the battle, 1839;

is reproduced in Stiles's <i>Brooklyn</i> (i. 63), with a view of the same date (p. 217). Cf. map in Valentine's <i>N. Y.
Manual</i> (1856). Cf. the bibliography of Long Island in <i>Amer. Bibliopolist</i>, Oct., 1872, and in Furman's

<p>The circumstances of the battle and retreat

Bancroft has been criticised by the grandsons

<p>Respecting the armies on both sides and their
losses, there is ground for dispute. It is claimed
that the British had about double the numbers
of the Americans, and the losses of killed
and wounded were about equal on both sides,
though the Americans also lost heavily in prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>

victory for the royal arms, and had little
of the disheartening influence which the forcing
of the redoubt at Bunker Hill had brought with
it. The effect was correspondingly inspiriting
to the Tories in America and to the government
party in England.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p class="p2">In transferring the scene across the river to
New York, it is best in the first place to trace
the topography of the town and island by the
maps of the period, and to follow the cartographical
records of the military movements
during the campaign, before classifying the authorities.</p>

<p>John Hill's large plan of New York, extending
as far north as Thirty-fourth Street, surveyed
in 1782, and dedicated to Gov. George Clinton,
was drawn in 1785.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> He marks all the works of
the Revolution,&mdash;coloring yellow those thrown
up by the Americans in 1776; orange, those of
the Americans which the British repaired; and
green, those later erected by the royal forces.
Johnston's map<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> adopts these yellow lines.
Loosing (<i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 593, 799), in describing
the New York lines, differs somewhat from
Hill's map. Johnston controverts Jones and
De Lancey (Jones's <i>New York during the Revolutionary
War</i>), who claim that the American
lines were levelled by the British; he also cites
Smythe, who described them in March, 1777, as
was also done by Thomas Eddis in Aug., 1777,<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>
and by Anburey in 1781, and he depends on
Hill's draft of them in 1782. Johnston (p. 36)
also describes the appearance of the town at the
opening of the war.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> Johnston (p. 194) claims
that his eclectic map is the first to give the entire
island as it was in 1776. He followed the
surveys of Ratzer and Montresor as far north as
Fiftieth Street, and from that point to Kingsbridge
he used the map of 1814, made by Randall
for the commissioners to lay out streets.
The annexed sketch of Johnston's map shows
the fortifications surrounding the town of New
York.</p>

Dawson's <i>New York City during the Amer. Rev.</i> (1861); Jones's <i>N. Y. during the Rev. War</i>, i. 388. There

<p>Howe was much criticised for his dilatoriness
and his failure promptly to use his fleet to get in
the rear of Washington's army.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> There was a division
of counsels among Washington's officers
as to the advisability of attempting to hold the
city; but a decision to evacuate finally prevailed.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>
Washington's army was gradually dwindling, for

stores, Washington gathered his forces within
the Harlem lines. Johnston's draft of the works
on Harlem Heights follows Sauthier's plan.
The site of the fight thereabouts is west of
Eighth Avenue and north of One Hundred and
Twenty-fifth Street of the modern city. Johnston
(p. 258) identifies the localities by the present
landmarks, and says (p.264) that "some of
the works are well preserved to-day" (1878).
He also says that Randall, when he surveyed
the island in 1812, found the remains of the
works agreeing with Sauthier's drafts.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>Sauthier's draft of the conflict at Harlem
Plains is reproduced in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>,
May, 1880. Later plans of the locality, drawn
with reference to the landmarks of the battle, or
interesting for comparison, are the map of 1814
in Valentine's <i>Manual</i> (1856) and the large folding
plan of the upper part of New York, with
the modern streets, upon which, in colors, is superposed
a draft of this action. This last is given,
with an account of the fight, in Shannon's <i>N. Y.
City Manual</i>, 1868, p. 812.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> We may note some
of the principal contemporary and later authorities

<p>The origin of the fire of Sept. 21st, by which
a considerable part of New York was burned,
has been a subject of dispute, the Tories charging
it upon the Americans;<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> but later authorities,
English as well as American, agree in not
believing it the work of incendiaries. It is
known that Washington advocated the burning
of the city if evacuation became necessary, and
Jones (i. p. 84) says committees of Congress had
agreed upon it, but that body certainly in the
end directed Washington to spare it (<i>Journals</i>,
Sept. 3, 1776).<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p class="pf400">When the British, leaving Newtown Creek, on Long Island, landed at Kip's Bay, the shore batteries thereabouts were abandoned by the Americans. Scott, at L, retreated by the
broken line (&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;), and crossed along Bowery Lane, the ground now covered by Union and Madison squares (shown by the dotted oblongs). Wadsworth and Douglas retreated from
M and N respectively, back upon Parsons at P and Fellows at Q, and all pursued the Bloomingdale road, just skirting the southwesterly corner of the area now known as Central Park
(the large dotted oblong E E). Meanwhile, the garrison of the town lines, under Putnam and Silliman, retreated by the road leading from Fort G towards Greenwich; and near
Bloomingdale the several columns joined and pursued their march to the lines on the heights above Harlem. Parton (<i>Life of Burr</i>, 86) describes how Burr at this time led Knox's
brigade successfully away from Bunker Hill. Howe, who had advanced from Kip's Bay, dallied at the Murray house at O, and so failed to intercept the fugitives. Chester (R) and
Sargeant (S) also deserted the works at Horn's Hook, and, striking the Kingsbridge or post read, retreated through McGowan's Pass at T. Thus all, by one road or another, got
within the lines on Harlem Heights. Farther on in the text this map will be again referred to, for later movements. Cf. map in Gay's <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. 491.</p>

Gov. Tryon, and published by William Faden in London, Jan. 1, 1779, as a <i>Chorographical Map of the Province
of New York in North America, Compiled from actual surveys deposited in the Patent Office at New
York</i>. This section is reproduced from a reduction made in 1849 by David Vaughan, and published in the
<i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, vol. i., where Tryon's report on the province in 1774 is printed. There is a copy of the original
in Harvard College library (portfolio 3520). It was the basis of the map <i>Carte des troubles de l'Amérique,
par ordre du Chev. Tryon, par Sauthier et Ratzer, traduite de l'Anglais, à Paris, chez Le Rouge</i>,
1778, which is included in the <i>Atlas Amériquain</i>, no. 15. It was also followed in maps published at Augsburg
in 1777, and at Nuremberg, 1778. There is another <i>Special Karte von den Brittischen Colonien in Nord
America</i>, showing the New England and Middle colonies, published in Christian Leiste's <i>Beschreibung des
Brittischen Amerika zur Ersparung der Englischen Karten</i>, Wolfenbüttel, 1778. An English map with a
Swedish title, <i>Krigs Theatre in America</i>, is found in the <i>Beskrifning öfver de Engelska Colonierne i Nord
America, 1776-1777</i> (Stockholm, 1777). Sauthier's surveys also appear in <i>A map of the province of New

<p class="pf400">Sauthier's drafts may be compared with <i>A map of the province of New York with part of Pensilvania and
New England from an actual survey by Captain Montresor, engineer, 1775</i>, which was published in London,
June 10, 1775, by A. Dury, making four sheets, and was republished "with great improvements", April 1, 1777
(<i>Brit. Mus. Map Catal.</i>, 1885, col. 2,969). It was reëngraved in Paris and published in 1777 by Le Rouge,
separately, and as nos. 13 and 14 of the <i>Atlas Amériquain</i> in 1778. Ithiel Town, in the preface of his <i>Particular
services</i>, etc.,&mdash;now a scarce book, as only seventy copies escaped a fire,&mdash;speaks of his having obtained
from a family near London maps of the American war, mostly about Boston, New York, and Philadelphia,
made by Montresor, which were submitted to Marshall. There is a portrait and account of Montresor in
Scull's <i>Evelyns in America</i>, 251.</p>

<p class="pf400">Another important map is <i>The Provinces of New York and New Jersey with part of Pensilvania and the
province of Quebec, drawn by Major Holland, Surveyor-General of the northern district in America, corrected
and improved from the original materials by Govern<sup>r</sup>, Pownall, Member of Parliament</i>. It was first
published in London, June 15, 1775, and in a second edition, in 1776, there were added to it marginal maps
of Amboy and the city and bay of New York. The <i>Brit. Mus. Map</i>, 1885, col. 2,969, shows the plates with
different titles, dated 1775, 1776; also Frankfort, 1777, and London, 1777. Cf. the map in Mills's <i>Boundaries
of Ontario</i>; the Evans map as reproduced by Jefferys, 1775 (see Vol. V. p. 85); the map in the <i>American
Atlas</i>, and that of the country from the Chesapeake to the Connecticut, in the <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, September, 1776.</p>

<p>It may be well now to note some of the contemporary
maps of the whole campaign, as indicating
the extent and character of the geographical
knowledge then current. The earliest of
these is one which appeared in the supplement
(p. 607) of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 1776, and
is called a <i>Map of the Progress of his Majesty's
Armies</i>. Two of the American household manuals,
<i>Low's Almanac</i> (1776) and <i>Isaac Warren's
Almanac</i> (1777), had the same rude cut, a fac-simile
of which, with the key, is shown below.</p>

<p>A popular map (price one shilling) of <i>The

in London, Jan. 1, 1777, by W. Hawkes, with a

to Oct. 18, 1776.</p>

<p>Des Barres issued in London, Jan. 17, 1777, a

of the same field was made in the <i>Political Mag.</i>,
vol. ii. p. 657. The earliest attempt at historical
rendering, Capt. Hall's <i>History of the Civil
War in America</i> (London, 1780), was accompanied
by a map, a portion of which is here
given in fac-simile; and Gordon (ii. 310), a few

<p>In giving detailed references for the several

Washington have been a source of the first importance;
and beside those given by Sparks in
his printed works, there are others registered in
the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (no. xxix.), the <i>Heath Papers</i>

gatherings,<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> all of which form a general

<p><b>II.</b> <span class="smcap">The Northern Campaign, 1776-1777.</span>&mdash;Gates
had taken command in Canada early in
the summer of 1776, under instructions from
Washington;<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> but as his army fell back within
the department which had been assigned to
Schuyler, questions of authority arose between
them.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<p>The condition of the army during the summer
is noted in Colonel Trumbull's <i>Autobiography</i>
(p. 302), and in General Gates's returns of September
22, 1776, in 5 <i>Force's American Archives</i>
(ii. 479).<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

<p>There is a list of armed vessels on Lake
Champlain in 1776 in <i>Letters and Papers</i>, 1761-1776
(MSS. in Mass. Hist. Soc.). Arnold received
his instructions from Gates.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<p>Arnold's reports on the fight near Valcour's
Island, Oct., 1776, are dated Oct. 12 (to Gates)
and Oct. 15 (to Schuyler).<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a></p>

<p>Waterbury's account to Congress, Oct. 24, is
in Dawson (i. p. 173) and in <i>Hadden's Journal</i>
(App.). Gen. Maxwell gave no very flattering
account of Arnold's manœuvres in a letter from
Ticonderoga, Oct. 20, in Sedgwick's <i>Livingston</i>
(p. 209).<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>On the English side, Carleton's despatch,
Oct. 14, and Capt. Pringle's, are in Dawson (pp.
174, 175). The Hanau artillerist Pausch covers
the fight in his journal.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a></p>

<p class="pf400">The map of the action accompanying <i>Hadden's Journal</i> (p. 23) is very similar to the Sparks map; and a
marginal note says that the gunboats are from 30 to 36 feet long, and 10, 16, or 18 feet wide. Gen. Rogers
thinks Hadden's map is based on Brassier, whose amended plate is in the <i>American Pocket Atlas</i> (1776).
Rogers objects to the view that Arnold's retreat was round the north end of Valcour's Island (instead of the
route marked on the map), as has been maintained by Palmer in his <i>Lake Champlain</i>, and by W. C. Watson
in the <i>Amer. Hist. Record</i> (iii. 438, 501) and <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i> (June, 1881, vol. vi. p. 414).</p>
</div></div>

<p>The earliest plan of this naval action seems to
have been added to the then recently published
plate of Lake Champlain, engraved after surveys
by William Brassier, by order of Amherst,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
in 1762,<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> which, with Jackson's survey of Lake
George, was published by Sayer and Bennett,
in London, Aug. 5, 1776. Some copies of the
map with the same date show the position of
Arnold's fight of Oct. 11. The plate has been
altered at that point, and it is this section of the
map which Lossing copies in his <i>Field-Book</i><a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>
(i. 163) and in his paper in <i>Harper's Monthly</i>
(vol. xxiii. p. 726). The annexed sketch is based
upon a plan in the Sparks maps (Cornell University),
kindly transmitted to the editor by the
librarian.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p class="p2">In the winter of 1776-77, Burgoyne had submitted
to the government some "Thoughts for
conducting the war from the side of Canada",&mdash;a
paper which, barring some important
changes, became the scheme of the summer's
plans.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

<p>The stages of the preparation in Canada can
be followed in <i>Force's American Archives</i>; and
references will be found in the <i>Index to MSS. in
the British Museum</i> (particularly under "Canada"
and "Burgoyne", in those acquired 1854-1875).<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>The records of the Germans are mentioned in
Lowell's <i>Hessians</i> (p. 117), and in the sources indicated
by Mr. Lowell in another chapter of the
present volume<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

<p>In the spring of 1777 St. Clair was designated
for the command at Ticonderoga, the advanced
post against the invasion of Burgoyne (<i>St. Clair
Papers</i>). The light-headed Sullivan thought it
unfair that he was not selected for the post (<i>Correspondence
of the Rev.</i>, i. 352). The British
onset was appalling. James Lovell, in March,
wrote, "It is plain that we must look forward
for another summer's bloody work" (<i>Mass. Hist.
Soc. Proc.</i>, April, 1860, p. 9). Congress was emphasizing
the stories of British brutality (<i>Journals
of Congress</i>, ii. 97).</p>

<p>On May 22d Schuyler had been confirmed in
his command of the Northern department, and
Gates had gone to Philadelphia to lay his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
grievances before Congress (Lossing's <i>Schuyler</i>,
ii.; Irving's <i>Washington</i>, iii.). Burgoyne (Fonblanque,
App. E) was talking to his Indians in
June, and two days later he made his famous
proclamation to frighten or allure the country
people. Fonblanque (p. 23) is not unmindful of
its unworthy bombast, and Lecky (vi. 64) says it
was "greatly and justly blamed."<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>There will be occasion later to enumerate the
maps illustrating the successive stages and conflicts
of the campaign; but it may be well at this
point to append in a note the principal maps of
the entire movement of the British army, which
cover also the field of its actions on both flanks.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<p>The most important source respecting the
siege and evacuation of Ticonderoga is the <i>Proceedings
of a General Court Martial, held at Whiteplains,
N. Y., for the trial of Maj.-Gen. St. Clair,
Aug. 25, 1778</i> (Philad., 1778).<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> It was reprinted
in the <i>Collections</i> of the N. Y. Hist. Soc. in 1880.
It includes various letters of Schuyler and St.
Clair in June (pp. 14, 101, 121, etc.), the doings
of the council of war, July 5th, which decided
upon a retreat (p. 33), and the letters of St. Clair
at Ticonderoga, and one to Hancock, July 14th,
from Fort Edward (p. 69, etc.). Three days
later, July 17th, St. Clair sent an account from
Fort Edward to Washington, which, with the
letter of Schuyler, likewise to Washington, is in
Sparks's <i>Corresp. of the Rev.</i>, i. 393, 400.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> Much
of this material is also included in the published
<i>St. Clair Papers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> Sparks had earlier added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
copies of some of the St. Clair papers to his
Collection of Manuscripts.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<p>On the English side, Burgoyne's letters are in
Fonblanque's <i>Burgoyne</i> (p. 248), <i>Gent. Mag.</i>,
Aug., 1777, and Dawson's <i>Battles</i>. Anburey's
<i>Travels</i> (letter xxx.) throws some light.</p>

<p>For the effect of the evacuation on the country,
see <i>Journals of Congress</i>, iv. 719; Wells's
<i>Sam. Adams</i>, ii. 485, 488; <i>Diplomatic Correspondence
of the Amer. Rev.</i>, i. 315. The apprehension
felt in the adjacent country is shown in letters
of Ira Allen and others in the <i>N. H. State
Papers</i>, viii. 632, 633, 643, 644, 648, 651.</p>

<p>We have some contemporary maps of Ticonderoga
previous to and during the siege. In
August, 1776, Colonel John Trumbull made
a plan which is engraved in his <i>Autobiography</i>
(N. Y., 1841, p. 32),<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> and is reproduced herewith.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
The map used at the trial of St. Clair
is engraved in the <i>Proceedings</i>; and from a MS.
copy made for Sparks, and now at Cornell University,
the annexed sketch (p. 353) is drawn.</p>

<p>On the affair at Hubbardton, July 7th, the
official accounts of St. Clair (July 14th) and
Burgoyne (July 11th) are given in Dawson's
<i>Battles</i> (i. 224, 229, 231), and other contemporary
accounts in the <i>Vermont Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, i.
p. 168, etc.<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></p>

<p>In Burgoyne's <i>State of the Expedition</i> is a
"plan of the action at Huberton under Brig.-Gen.
Fraser, supported by Maj.-Gen. Riedesel,
on the 7th July, 1777, drawn by P. Gerlach, engraved
by Wm. Faden", and published at London,
Feb. 1, 1780.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> Three days later, Burgoyne
(July 10) issued a proclamation to the inhabitants
of Vermont, and Schuyler (July 13) made
a counter proclamation.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The chief sources of documentary evidence
regarding the movements in 1777 around Fort
Stanwix are <i>5 Force's Archives</i> (vols. i., ii., and
iii.) and the Gansevoort Papers (copies in <i>Sparks
MSS.</i>, lx.), including a letter of Arnold, August
22, 1777, dated at German Flats, which Sparks
has indorsed "evidently intended to be intercepted."
On the American side, we have further
Colonel Willet's letter<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> to Trumbull, Aug.
11th, in Dawson (i. 248); the account in the
<i>Penna. Evening Post</i>, given in Moore's <i>Diary</i> (i.
477); Wilkinson's <i>Memoirs</i> (pp. 204, 212); the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
<i>Journals of the New York Provincial Congress</i>
(vol. i.); and Sparks's <i>Corresp. of the Rev.</i> (ii.
578). Gordon gives some details from eye-witnesses,
mainly through reports made to him by
the Rev. Samuel Kirkland. Dwight picked up
anecdotes about the battlefield in 1799, which he
prints in his <i>Travels</i> (vol. iii.). The best eclectic
accounts are those by William L. Stone, father
and son,&mdash;the elder giving us his <i>Life of Brant</i>
(i. ch. 10 and 11), and the younger, his <i>Orderly-book
of Sir John Johnson during the Oriskany
campaign, 1776-1777, annotated by William L.
Stone. With an historical introduction illustrating
the life of Sir John Johnson, by J. Watts

of the tories or loyalists in America contributed
by Theodorus Bailey Myers</i> (Albany,

The younger Stone's labors took a wider
range in that portion of his <i>Campaign of Lieutenant-Gen.
John Burgoyne</i> which is given to the
expedition of St. Leger, though he followed in
the main his father's <i>Life of Brant</i>. In the <i>Orderly-book</i>,
just mentioned, however he modified
some of his views.</p>

<p>There is rather too much of patriotic fervor
for a discriminating analysis in a monograph,
<i>The Battle of Oriskany, its place in History, an
address at the Centennial Celebration, Aug. 6, 1877,
by Ellis H. Roberts</i> (Utica, 1877), but it is in
most respects valuable and a convenient gathering
of information, not otherwise found without
much trouble, and is well fortified with notes.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<p>To illustrate the movements near Fort Schuyler
or Stanwix, we have the plan made by Fleury
in Sept., 1777, which is engraved in Stone's <i>Life

side as being made "of logs thrown up but not completed", from which a "path for cattle" led to Hubbardton.
Mount Defiance is called "Sugar Loaf Hill." The English are represented as landing at the point
marked "Camp", and the Germans on the opposite shore. Gen. Phillips took the position on Mount Hope.
Lossing (<i>Field-Book</i>, i. 131) gives a view from the top of Mount Defiance. A description of the fortifications
about Ticonderoga, from Riedesel's <i>Memoirs</i>, is in Stone's <i>Campaign of Burgoyne</i> (p. 434).</p>

General Lincoln sent the first accounts to
Schuyler, who transmitted them to Washington
(Sparks's <i>Corresp. of the Rev.</i>, i. 425). Stark's

<p>The local aspects of the fight are touched
upon in Hall's and other histories of Vermont,<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>
and the general authorities necessarily
enlarge more or less upon it, as an episode.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>
At the first anniversary of the Bennington fight,
in 1778, a speech was made by Noah Smith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
which was printed at Hartford in 1779, and is
reprinted in the <i>Vermont Hist. Coll.</i> (i. p. 251).
On Oct. 20, 1848, James D. Butler gave an address
before the Legislature of Vermont, which
"contained original testimonies of witnesses
now long dead, and notes from papers since
burned in the Vermont State House." When
printed at Burlington, in 1849, it was accompanied
by an address by George Frederick
Houghton on the life and services of Col. Seth
Warner.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> The centennial observances of 1877
produced several memorials.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>Gen. Carrington (<i>Battles</i>, p. 334) gives one of
the best plans of the Bennington fight. There
is among the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (no. xxviii.) a sketch
map, with this indorsement by Mr. Sparks:
"Drawn by Mr. Hiland Hall, Bennington, Oct.
13, 1826. Very accurate. Ground examined by
myself at the time." It shows the Walloomsack
River (a branch of the Hoosick River) with the
skirting road to Bennington, three times crossing
the river. On this road, going up stream, are
marked (in order) the beginning of the second
action, the hill where the stand was attempted,
the places where Breyman was met by Warner,
where the cannon were posted in the first battle,
and the line of Stark's advance.</p>

<p>In Burgoyne's <i>State of the Expedition</i> is a
plan called "Position of the Detachment under
Lieut.-Col. Baum, at Walmscook, near Bennington,
shewing the attacks of the enemy on
the 16th of August, 1777, drawn by Lieut. Durnford,
engineer; engraved by Wm. Faden", and
published at London, Feb. 1, 1780.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Meanwhile Schuyler was gathering an army
as best he could. In July he wrote to Heath
that its spirits were recovering (<i>Heath Papers</i>,
i. 300). The militia were called out early in
August to assist him (<i>Journals of Congress</i>, ii.
214). W. L. Stone tells the story of Moses
Harris, his faithful spy, in the <i>Mag. of Amer.
Hist.</i> (ii. 414). The discontent with Schuyler
on the part of the politicians was beginning to
be shaped to party measures, and led to his
being superseded in August by Gates, while a
battle was imminent, as Schuyler thought.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></p>

<p>Bancroft (vol. ix.) does not hold Schuyler
free from the responsibility of the ill success
of the campaign up to this time; but he is controverted
by G. W. Schuyler in his <i>Correspondence
and Remarks upon Bancroft's History of
the Northern Campaign</i>; by Lossing in his
<i>Schuyler</i>; and by J. W. De Peyster in the <i>Mag.
of Amer. Hist.</i> (February, 1877, vol. i. 134).<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a></p>

<p>Burgoyne meanwhile (August 26) was writing
to Germain that the campaign was looking
badly, and the loyalists not as helpful as he
hoped. The conflict which Schuyler thought
impending took place September 19, and is variously
known as the battle of Freeman's Farm,
or Stillwater, or the first battle of Bemis's
Heights. Gates had already appealed to the
Green Mountain boys for assistance, as the records
of the Vermont Council of Safety show
(Stevens, <i>Bibl. Geog.</i>, 1870, no. 693). Gen. Glover's
letters to James Warren during Aug. and
Sept. are in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (no. xlvii.) and in
Upham's <i>Glover</i>, and his account of the battle
of the 19th is in <i>Essex Institute Hist. Coll.</i> (v.
no. 3). Col. Varick's letter to Schuyler is in the
<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, lxvi. Wilkinson gives the best account
of any participant (i. ch. 6), and his letter
of Sept. 20 is in Dawson (i. 301). Gates's letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
to Congress, Sept. 22, is also in Dawson (i. 301).
Gordon gives the American loss.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<p>The question of Arnold's participancy in the
battle of the 19th, while the left wing&mdash;his own
command&mdash;was engaged, has been the subject
of controversy.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

<p>The attempt of an American force to cut
Burgoyne's line of communications by the lakes
is described in the "Fight at Diamond Island",
Sept. 24, by De Costa, who gives the official report
of Col. Brown (<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal.
Reg.</i>, 1872, p. 147). These evidences come
mainly from the Gates Papers, and are recapitulated
in Stone's <i>Campaign of Burgoyne</i> (App.
10).</p>

<p>Respecting the action of Oct. 7, the earliest
official accounts are in Glover's letter of Oct. 9,
and in Gates's to Congress, of Oct. 18,&mdash;both
of which are reprinted by Dawson (i. 302, 303).
James Wilkinson's letter of Oct. 9 is in the New
York Archives, with various other letters of the
campaign (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, no. xxix.). A letter of
Oliver Wolcott from Bemis's Heights is in the
<i>Trumbull MSS.</i> (vol. vii.). The lives of Arnold
(by I. N. Arnold, ch. 10, etc.) indicate his important
influence on the field, where he was wounded.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a></p>

<p>On the action of Col. Brooks in the field see
<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> (vii. 478). There is an
account by Samuel Woodruff, an eye-witness, in
the appendix of <i>An account of Burgoyne's Campaign
and the memorable battles of Bemis's Heights,
Sept. 19th, and October 7th, 1777, from the most
authentic resources of information, including
many incidents connected with the same</i>, by
Charles Neilson (Albany, 1844).<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p>The story of Major Acland and Lady Acland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
has long been one of the romantic episodes of the
campaign. The family account is given by W.
L. Stone in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i> 1877 (iv. 50),
and Jan., 1880, and in <i>Lippincott's Mag.</i>, Oct.,
1879.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>The various stages of the negotiations which
resulted in what is known as the "Convention"
can be followed in the documents given in Fonblanque
(p. 306); Wilkinson's <i>Memoirs</i> (pp. 304,
306, 317); Dawson (i. 303); Stedman's <i>Amer.
War</i>; Stone's <i>Campaign of Burgoyne</i> (p. 102);
and O'Callaghan's <i>Orderly-Book of Burgoyne</i>.
The original definitive articles are in the N. Y.
Hist. Soc., and fac-similes of the signatures are
in Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i> (i. 79).<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></p>

<p>Wilkinson carried the news of the surrender
to Congress (Wilkinson's <i>Memoirs</i>; Wells's
<i>Sam. Adams</i>, ii. 494). Gates describes his own
success to his wife (Moore's <i>Diary</i>, 511). Chaplain
Smith gives some details of the meeting
of Gates and Burgoyne (<i>Chaplain Smith and the
Baptists</i>, p. 222). There are reminiscences in
Surgeon Meyrick's letter in Trumbull's <i>Autobiography</i>
(p. 301), and papers in <i>Pennsylvania
Archives</i> (vol. v.). Recollections of Gen. Ebenezer
Mattoon, an actor in the scene as written
out in 1835, are in the Appendix (no. 13) of
Stone's <i>Campaign of Burgoyne</i>. The comment
of Wm. Whipple is in <i>N. H. State Papers</i>, viii.
707. Burgoyne's letter from Albany, Oct. 20, to
Germain is in his <i>State of the Expedition</i>.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a></p>

<p>De Lancey (App. p. 674, to Jones's <i>New York
during the Rev.</i>) collates the authorities on the
strength of the respective armies. Gates's returns
of his army (11,098) are in the Gates MSS.
Burgoyne, in his <i>State of the Expedition</i>, gives
Gates's returns as 18,624,&mdash;the difference may
be the number of sick and furloughed men.
Burgoyne praised Gates's men after he had seen
them (Fonblanque, 316). The numbers of Burgoyne's
army are given in Appendix D in Fonblanque.
The question is also examined in the
App. of Stone's <i>Campaign of Burgoyne</i>. Gordon
(<i>Amer. Rev.</i>, ii. 578) gives the number surrendered
at 5,791; but there is a great difference in
the estimates. Alexander Scammell makes it
10,611 in <i>Letters and Papers, 1777-80</i> (Mass.
Hist. Soc. Cabinet). In the Stark MSS. is a
table of Burgoyne's losses (14,000), covering the
whole campaign, and put into verse (<i>Sparks
MSS.</i>, xxxix.).<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

<p>Respecting the campaign as a whole, the best
contemporary accounts on the American side are
found in the official correspondence as embraced
in Sparks's <i>Washington</i> (iv. 486, etc.) and <i>Correspondence
of the Revolution</i> (vol. ii., App.), and
in the letters of the commanding generals.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>

<p>Various important letters are put in evidence
in the <i>Proceedings of the general court martial for
the trial of Maj.-Gen. Schuyler, Oct. 1, 1778</i>
(Philad., 1778).<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

<p>An account of Alexander Bryan, Gates's chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
scout, is in the App. of Stone's <i>Campaign of
Burgoyne</i>.</p>

<p>There are among the copies of the Lincoln
Papers in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (xii.) various letters,
etc., respecting the campaign against Burgoyne.
The earliest is one from Gen. Schuyler to Lincoln,
dated at Saratoga, July 31, 1777, and the
last is one from Lincoln to Gov. Clinton, Oct. 5,
1777, expressing anxiety lest Putnam should not
be able to resist Gen. Clinton, to whom Burgoyne
in his straits was looking for relief.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> At a later
day Lincoln wrote a long letter from Boston,
Feb. 5, 1781, to John Laurens, recounting his
part in this campaign from the time of Gates's
taking command to the date of Lincoln's being
wounded, Oct. 8th (Sparks's <i>Corresp. of the Rev.</i>,
ii. 533).</p>

<p>Various letters of Henry Brockholst Livingston
during the Northern campaign of 1777 (June-Aug.),
only parts of which are printed in Sedgwick's
<i>Livingston</i>, are among the papers of Gov.
William Livingston, which, when Sparks made
his copies in 1832 (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, lii., vol. iii.)
were in the possession of Theodore Sedgwick, Jr.
Other letters will be found in the <i>Trumbull MSS.</i>
(Mass. Hist. Soc.)<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>The campaign of Burgoyne has necessarily
made part of the labors of the general historians.
Gordon and Ramsay were among the earliest,
on the American, and Stedman (i. ch. 16) on
the English side. Of the later writers, Bancroft
gives it three chapters (21, 22, 24) in his original
edition, and four in his final revision<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> (10, 11, 12,
13). Lowell finds it an important section of his
history of the German auxiliaries (<i>Hessians</i>, p.
221, etc.). The lives of principal participants,
like Arnold, Lincoln, Gates, and Schuyler on
the American side, cover it.</p>

<p>A recent life of Morgan, <i>The Hero of Cowpens</i>,
by Rebecca McConkey (N. Y., 1881), would
claim for the Virginian the praise which is usually
given to Arnold. The general surveys of
Marshall (iii. ch. 5) and Irving (iii. ch. 9-22)
brought it within the scope of their lives of
Washington; and J. C. Hamilton's <i>Republic of
the United States</i> includes it. Local aspects
are treated in Dunlap's <i>New York</i>; Holden's
<i>Queensbury</i> (p. 433); Hollister's <i>Connecticut</i>;
Hinman's <i>Connecticut during the Revolution</i> (p.
112); and Mrs. Bonney's <i>Historical Gleanings</i>
(i. 58). Robin's <i>New Travels</i> (letter 12) gives the
current accounts prevailing a little later.</p>

<p>The earliest considerable monographic narrative
was Charles Neilson's <i>Original, Compiled
and Corrected Account of Burgoyne's Campaign,
and the Memorable Battle of Bemis's Heights, September
19, and October 7, 1777, from the most
Authentic Sources of Information</i>, etc. (Albany,
1844).</p>

<p>The most devoted chronicler of the campaign,
however, is the younger William L. Stone (b.
1835), who published <i>Reminiscences of Saratoga
and Ballston</i> in 1875, an article on "Burgoyne
in a new light" in <i>The Galaxy</i> (v. 78), and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
on the campaign in <i>Harper's Monthly</i> in 1877
(vol. lv. p. 673), and in the same year the most
important work on the subject yet produced,
<i>The Campaign of Lieutenant-General John Burgoyne
and the Expedition of Lieutenant-Colonel
Barry St. Leger</i>, which draws from every important
help to the study of the military movements
which had been so far brought to light. In the
next year (1878), Mr. Stone prepared the <i>Memoir
of the Centennial Celebration of Burgoyne's Surrender,
Schuylerville, Oct. 17, 1875</i>. It included
an historical address by Mr. Stone himself,
others by Horatio Seymour and George William
Curtis.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p>The English later writers have been in the
main fair in their statements. Mahon (vi. 191),
while praising the army of Gates, denies him
the merit of its successful conduct, giving it essentially
to Stark and Arnold. The American
student finds little to question in the unusually
impartial narrative embodied in Edward Barrington
De Fonblanque's <i>Political and Military
episodes in the latter half of the Eighteenth Century,
derived from the life and Correspondence of
John Burgoyne</i> (London, 1776).<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

<p>On the German side the main sources are

(Hannover, 1863,&mdash;2 vols.), who gives chapters
7 and 8 to this campaign; the same writer's
<i>Leben und Wirken des Herzoglich-Braunschweig'schen</i>
<i>General-lieutenants Friedrich Adolph von
Riedesel</i> (Leipzig, 1856,&mdash;3 vols.) and <i>Generalin

on May 21st, and on the 26th and 28th made

the conduct of Howe's as well as Burgoyne's
campaigns in 1777, which will be noticed
in another place.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">THE STRUGGLE FOR THE DELAWARE.&mdash;PHILADELPHIA
UNDER HOWE AND UNDER ARNOLD.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY FREDERICK D. STONE,</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>Librarian of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">"THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and
the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of his
country, but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and
woman."</p>

<p>So wrote Thomas Paine, December 19, 1776. The preceding month had
been fraught with adversity. The loss of Fort Washington on the 16th of
November had rendered Fort Lee useless, as with it alone the passage of
the river could not be obstructed. Its evacuation was immediately ordered,
and the ammunition and some of the guns were removed. Before all could
be taken away, however, the fort became the object of the enemy's attention.
On the night of the 19th, two columns under Cornwallis, composed
of British and Germans, with a detachment from the fleet, in all about six
thousand men, crossed the river and landed at Closter dock, seven miles
above Fort Lee, then commanded by General Greene. The night was
stormy, and the movement escaped the notice of Greene's sentries. By
morning the sailors had dragged the artillery to the top of the Palisades,
and everything was ready for an advance upon the fort. Greene was
informed of the landing of Cornwallis, and immediately took steps to
secure a retreat for his command, then numbering about three thousand
men. Word was sent to Washington, who was at the village of Hackensack
with the troops which he had brought with him from White Plains.
In three quarters of an hour the commanding general was at Greene's side.
Seeing that the fort was not tenable, he ordered a retreat. No time was
to be lost; and leaving the tents standing, the kettles over the fires, and
such stores as could not be removed, the troops were hurried towards the
advancing enemy with such speed that they gained the road leading to the
only bridge over the Hackensack before Cornwallis could intercept them.</p>

<p>The situation of the Americans was now more precarious than it had
been at Fort Lee. They were in danger of being shut in between the
Hackensack and Passaic rivers; they were in a perfectly flat country, without
intrenching tools or camp equipage; their right flank could be turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
and their line of retreat threatened if the British should land a force at the
head of Newark Bay or at Amboy. Washington's forces were greatly
reduced by reverses and by desertions. Nearly all that were left were
militia of the flying camp, called out for an emergency, and impatient to
return home, as their time of service had nearly expired. Small as his
numbers were, Washington was obliged to post some at Amboy and others
at Brunswick, to protect his flanks. As those remaining were insufficient
to hinder the advance of the enemy in his front, he ordered Lee, whom he
had left in command on the east of the Hudson, to cross that river and
join him, and, with hardly three thousand men, Washington began his
retreat through the Jerseys.</p>

<p>On the 21st he was at Aquacknoc Bridge on the Passaic, and by the 23d
at Newark. On the 28th he left Newark, the advance-guard of the British
entering the town as his rear-guard quitted it, and the next day he arrived
at Brunswick. Here an attempt would have been made to prevent the
enemy crossing the Raritan, but the stream was fordable in a number of
places. As the British approached, the Jersey and Maryland brigades,
whose terms of service expired that day, refused to stay an hour longer,
and as the British crossed the river the line of march was again taken up
for Trenton. This point was reached on the 2d of December, two brigades
having been left at Princeton, under Stirling, to watch the enemy.</p>

<p>Having seen his stores and baggage safely over the Delaware, and being
reinforced by about twelve hundred militia from the neighborhood of Philadelphia,
Washington faced about on the 6th, with such men as were fit for
service, and set out to join Stirling at Princeton.</p>

<p>It had not been the intention of Howe, when he ordered Cornwallis over
the Hudson, to do more than take possession of and hold East Jersey, and
Cornwallis's orders did not permit him to go beyond Brunswick. But the
slight opposition which Washington was able to offer to the British advance
excited in Howe the hopes of capturing Philadelphia, and he joined Cornwallis
in person at Brunswick. After a short halt, he pushed on towards
Stirling at Princeton, and before Washington could reach that general
Stirling was in full retreat, to avoid being intercepted. A retrograde movement
was ordered, and by the 8th the American army was on the west
bank of the Delaware. The advance of Cornwallis's column reached the
river before the rear-guard of the Americans had landed on the Pennsylvania
side; but as Washington had secured all the boats for a considerable
distance above and below Trenton, his position was comparatively a safe
one. Here for a time he rested his men, and urged upon Congress the
necessity of raising additional troops, and the importance of preparing for
the defence of Philadelphia, as the military stores were in that city.</p>

<p>In his retreat through the Jerseys, Washington was greatly embarrassed
by the conduct of General Charles Lee. The instructions he had given
Lee on the 17th of November to join him may have been discretionary,
but the language and frequency of his orders left no doubt of the expectations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
of the commander-in-chief. But Lee chose to read the orders in
the light of his wishes. On the east of the Hudson he had an independent
command, which he purposed to retain as long as he could. Schemes and
suggestions that should have had no weight were allowed to delay his passage
over the river until December 2d, and then his advance was slow and
hesitating. The prospect of receiving reinforcements from the Northern
army, which would make his command
equal to that of Washington,
strengthened his wish to act
independently. He proposed, as
soon as the troops from the north
should join him, to attack the
rear of the enemy. While this
plan may not have been devoid of
military judgment, it is doubtful
if it would have had more than a
temporary effect on Howe's movements,
while it would have deprived
Washington of the reinforcements
he so greatly needed.
Notwithstanding Washington's
explicit directions to avoid the
enemy in joining him, Lee hung
so close to the enemy's flank as
to leave a doubt of his real intentions,
and on the morning of the
13th, just after having put on record
that he believed Washington
to be "damnably deficient", he was surprised and taken prisoner by Lieutenant-Colonel
Harcourt, at White's tavern, near Baskingridge, three miles
from his camp.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The estimation in which Lee was held gave an undue importance to his
capture. The British thought that in it they had deprived their opponents
of nearly all the military science they possessed, and they styled him the
American Palladium. With the Americans he had many friends, who were
flattered that a soldier of European distinction should have espoused their
cause, and, dazzled with his success at Charleston, they rated him higher
than Washington, and, unintentionally perhaps, weakened the confidence
that should have been reposed in the commander-in-chief by his subordinates.</p>

<p>Having failed to overtake Washington in New Jersey, Howe turned northward
to Coryell's Ferry, fifteen miles above Trenton, in hopes of finding
boats to enable him to cross the Delaware; but in this he was disappointed.
He then took post at Pennington with a portion of his force, while with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
remainder he returned to Trenton, repaired the bridges below the town
which the Americans had destroyed, and extended his line as far as Burlington.</p>

<p>So great was the terror spread through New Jersey as the British advanced,
that many of her citizens took advantage of the amnesty which was
offered by the Howes to all who would put themselves under their protection
within sixty days from the 30th of November. Chief among these was
Samuel Tucker, president of the Committee of Safety, who had held many
positions of honor and trust. Nor was this defection confined to the east
side of the Delaware. It was now that Joseph Galloway, and citizens of
Philadelphia, like the Allens, who had supported the cause of the colonies
until independence became the avowed object of the war, sought safety
within the British lines. But the influence which their conduct might have
exercised upon the people was neutralized by what was soon endured at the
hands of the British and Hessian troops. Never before had any of the colonies
been exposed to the unbridled impulses of a mercenary and licentious
soldiery. Houses were plundered and their contents destroyed in mere wantonness,
women were forced to submit to indignities, and all the horrors
which usually attended the invasion of a European country by a foreign

<p>In Philadelphia the excitement was intense. On the 28th of November
a meeting was held in the State House yard to consider the condition of
affairs. It was addressed by Mifflin, who had been sent to the city to warn
Congress of the danger which threatened the army. He spoke with animation,
and endeavored to rouse the people to action. His efforts met with
some success, and in a few days the troops that reinforced Washington prior
to his retreat into Pennsylvania were in motion. On the 30th the Council
of Safety advised the citizens to prepare, upon short notice, to remove their
wives and children to places of safety. On December 2d, when it was known
in the city that Howe's army was at Brunswick, crowds gathered at the Coffee
House to learn the news. The stores and schools were closed, and all
business was suspended. No one was allowed to cross the Delaware without
a pass, while recruiting parties with drums beating paraded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
streets. The roads leading from the city were crowded with vehicles of
every description, bearing the families of citizens and their effects to places
of refuge.</p>

<p>When these means of transportation failed, the water craft on the Delaware
was pressed into service. Women with children in their arms were
crowded in smoky cabins so low that they could not sit upright, while the
younger girls were quartered on the decks, from whence they were driven by
the snow and rain. But sadder sights presented themselves in the streets
of the city. The sick of the army arrived daily. Many of the men had
gone to the field clad only for a summer campaign. They had succumbed
to exposure, and had reached Philadelphia in an almost naked condition.
Measures were at once set on foot for their relief. Vacant houses were
taken for their accommodation. The most seriously afflicted were sent to
the hospitals, while committees of citizens went from door to door begging
clothing for their use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>Handbills were issued giving information of
the advance of the enemy, and to awaken the indignation of the people
printed sheets were circulated describing the insults to which the women
of New Jersey had been subjected. Some of the citizens refused to take
the Continental money, as it was rumored that Congress would soon disperse.
On the 11th of December Congress requested Washington to contradict
this rumor in general orders, and to assure the army that the delegates
would remain in Philadelphia until it was certain the enemy would
capture the city. It was well that Washington exercised his discretion in
this matter, for the next day the crushing news was known throughout the
city that he had been obliged to cross the Delaware. Congress at once
adjourned to Baltimore, having first conferred on Washington "full power
to order and direct all things relative to the department and to the operations
of the war."</p>

<p>The state of political affairs in Pennsylvania was the chief cause of the
inefficiency which exposed Philadelphia to the danger of capture and of the
panic with which her citizens were seized. The old colonial charter had
been abrogated, but the new constitution had not been put into effect, and
the condition of society bordered upon anarchy.</p>

<p>For two weeks after Washington had retreated across the Delaware there
seemed little chance of impeding the British advance. "Day by day the
little handful was decreasing, from sickness and other causes." The services
of all the regular troops in it, with the exception of those from Virginia
and Maryland, expired on the first of the year, and the militia could
not be depended upon. "They come", wrote Washington, "you cannot tell
how, go you cannot tell when, and act you cannot tell where, consume your
provisions, exhaust your stores, and leave you at last at a critical moment."
"These", he said again to Congress, on the 20th of December, "are the
men I am to depend upon ten days hence." On Congress he urged the
importance of raising at once an army upon a more substantial basis, and
impressed upon those around him the necessity of the utmost vigilance.
But in the anguish of the moment he wrote to his brother: "If every nerve
is not strained to recruit the new army with all possible expedition, I think
the game is pretty nearly up.... I cannot entertain the idea that [our
cause] will finally sink, though it may remain for some time under a cloud."</p>

<p>Each day brought new difficulties to be overcome. When it was learned
that the fleet that had sailed from New York had appeared off New London,
the march of a portion of Heath's troops, which had been ordered
from Peekskill, was countermanded, and three regiments from Ticonderoga
were directed to halt at Morristown, where about eight hundred
militia had been collected, and General Maxwell was sent to command
them. On the 20th, the troops under Gates and Sullivan joined Washington.
The former had been sent by Schuyler. Sullivan's division was
that which had been commanded by Lee up to the time of his capture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
Washington had been led to believe that a portion of these troops had
reënlisted, and he had been waiting until they should join him to strike a
blow at Howe's forces. Only a small number of the men had done so,
however, and he found that on the first of the year he would have but
fifteen hundred men independent of the militia. It was evident, therefore,
that the blow must be struck at once.</p>

<p>On the 14th of December the British troops went into winter-quarters.
They were stationed at Brunswick, Princeton, Trenton, and Bordentown.
Howe returned to his easy quarters in New York. Cornwallis obtained permission
to visit England, and left Grant at Brunswick in command of New
Jersey. The troops at Trenton were under the Hessian, Lieut.-Col. Rahl;
those at Bordentown were commanded by his superior, Count Donop, who
had some outposts as far south as Burlington and Mount Holly. Howe
knew his line was too far extended, but he wished to cover the county of
Monmouth, where there were indications of an outbreak on the part of
some loyalists. The American army reached from Coryell's Ferry to Bristol.
The crossings above Trenton were guarded by Stirling, Mercer, Stephen,
and Fermoy. Ewing lay opposite Trenton. Dickinson with a few
New Jersey troops was opposite Bordentown, and Cadwalader with the
Pennsylvania militia was at Bristol.</p>

<p>Washington decided to attack the troops at Trenton. His men fit for
duty did not exceed five thousand, and of these nearly two thousand were
militia. The troops under Rahl consisted of three battalions of Hessians,
having with them six field-pieces, fifty chasseurs, and twenty dragoons,&mdash;twelve
hundred in all. Circumstances favored the plan which Washington
now adopted. Colonel Griffin, with two companies of Virginians
and some militia, had driven a party of Hessians, who had penetrated as far
south as Moorestown and Haddonfield, back to Mount Holly, where they
had been reinforced by Donop, who was thus too far removed from
Trenton to support Rahl in case of an emergency. The success of Griffin
made the militia at Bristol anxious for service, and it was decided by
Cadwalader and Reed, who was with him, to gratify them by supporting
Griffin. To this Washington assented, and at the same time confided to
Reed and Cadwalader his contemplated movement against Trenton. On
the morning of the 23d he wrote to them asking if the plan had been
carried out, and informed them that one hour before day on the morning
of the 26th was the time he had fixed upon for attacking Rahl. "For
heaven's sake", he wrote, "keep this to yourselves as the discovery of it
may prove fatal to us. Our numbers, sorry I am to say, being less than I
had any conception of; but necessity, dire necessity, will, nay must justify
an attack. Prepare and concert with Griffin; attack as many of their posts
as you possibly can with a prospect of success; the more we can attack at
the same instant the more confusion we shall spread, and the greater good
will result from it."</p>

<p>Washington was informed that it was impracticable to act with Griffin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
and Reed repaired to Philadelphia to urge Putnam to create a diversion by
crossing the river at Cooper's Ferry. He found, however, that little could
be expected from Putnam, and returned to Bristol on the 25th, where
Cadwalader was preparing to carry out the part which Washington had
assigned to him. It was the intention of Washington to cross the Delaware
above Trenton with about one half of his command, and attack the
enemy, while Ewing and Cadwalader should cross opposite Trenton and
Bristol, and not only cut Rahl's line of retreat but prevent Donop from
reinforcing him.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that no aid could be expected from Putnam,
Washington determined to proceed, and urged Cadwalader to do all in his
power to support him. The boats had been gathered at McKonkey's
Ferry, nine miles above Trenton, and as the men marched to them the footprints
they left in the snow were here and there tinged with blood from
the feet of those who wore broken shoes. The boats were promptly
manned by Glover's regiment from Marblehead, and at dark the crossing
began. It was three o'clock before the artillery was landed, and four
before the troops took up the line of march. The attack was to have been
made about five, and against a more vigilant enemy this delay would have
proved fatal. But Rahl was not vigilant. He despised his opponents, and
refused to protect his position with redoubts as instructed by Donop.  He
had been informed of Washington's intended movement, but paid no attention
to the report. It so happened that on the morning of the attack
his outposts had been fired upon by a body of strolling militia, and this he
supposed was the attack he was to look for. Washington had with him
two thousand four hundred men. These he divided into two columns.
One was commanded by Sullivan, and marched by the river road which
entered the town on the northwest. The other, under Greene, took the
Pennington road which approached the town from the north. The Americans
advanced in a violent storm of snow and hail. Greene's command
arrived at the outskirts of the town three minutes before Sullivan's. The
attacks of both parties were almost simultaneously. Many of the guns
were rendered useless by the storm, and the men were ordered to charge.
Those who had bayonets fixed them and rushed upon the pickets, who
retired. The Hessians were taken entirely by surprise. For a while Rahl
was allowed to remain undisturbed in bed, but when matters grew serious
he was aroused and hurriedly assumed command. Some of his half-formed
regiments were advanced towards the Americans, but were driven back,
throwing those in their rear into inextricable confusion. Two lines of
retreat were open to Rahl. One lay over the bridge which crossed the
Assanpink, south of the town; the other was the road to Brunswick. But
Sullivan's attack was so spirited that the Hessians were driven past the
road which led to the bridge, and as they attempted to escape towards
Brunswick, Washington intercepted them with Hand's riflemen and held
them in check. A battery under Captain Thomas Forrest created great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
havoc in their ranks, and two of their guns were turned against it. These
were immediately charged by the Americans, who were led by Captain
William Washington and Lieutenant James Monroe. Both were wounded,
but the guns were captured. Rahl was mortally wounded in trying to rally
his men, and shortly after he fell his command surrendered. All was over
in three quarters of an hour. With the exception of the horse and a small
number of the infantry which escaped over the Assanpink or to Brunswick,
Rahl's entire force was either killed or captured. The prisoners numbered
nine hundred and eighteen. The killed, Washington thought, did not
exceed twenty or thirty. The Americans had two privates killed, one
frozen to death, and two officers and four men wounded. As the enemy
were supposed to be in force at Princeton and Bordentown, and the Americans
were in no condition to withstand an attack, it was thought best
not to risk the advantage which had been gained, and as soon as the men
were rested the army, with its prisoners, returned to Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Ewing and Cadwalader had been unable to carry out the parts assigned
them, on account of the ice. The latter sent a portion of his infantry over
the river, but recalled it when he found he could not land his artillery.
With no definite news of Washington's success, Cadwalader recrossed on
the morning of the 27th, supposing Washington to be at Trenton. He
soon learned his mistake, but discovered that Donop had retreated towards
Brunswick when he heard of the action at Trenton. Cadwalader then
moved on to Burlington, and on the 29th marched to Crosswicks. The
desperate condition of affairs previous to the battle had stimulated the people
to extraordinary efforts, and the news of the victory raised their spirits
in proportion to the depression they had so lately suffered. Ignorant of
the victory Washington had achieved, Congress on the 27th vested him
with powers that virtually constituted him a military dictator for the period
of six months. To convince the people of the reality of the victory, the
Hessians were marched through the streets of Philadelphia, and one of
their standards was hung up in the chamber of Congress at Baltimore.
Public rejoicings broke forth on every side. "The Lord of Hosts has
heard the cry of the distressed, and sent an angel to their assistance", exclaimed
Muhlenberg, the patriarch of the Lutherans. On the 27th and
28th of December, fifteen hundred militia under Mifflin followed Cadwalader
into New Jersey, while the Jerseymen gathered at Morristown and
other points. In the face of this feeling it was necessary that the offensive
should be resumed, and on the 30th Washington occupied Trenton. The
service of the New England troops expired on the first of the year; but
through the efforts of Robert Morris money was raised to offer bounties,
which, with appeals to their patriotism, induced them to remain six weeks
longer with the army.</p>

<p>As soon as Cornwallis heard of the surprise at Trenton, he gave up his
visit to England and hastily joined Grant at Brunswick. On the 30th, with
8,000 men, he marched towards Trenton, with the determination of driving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Washington over the Delaware or capturing his entire force. Washington
immediately ordered Cadwalader and Mifflin to Trenton, and sent forward
a detachment under General Fermoy to retard the advance of Cornwallis.
On the night of January the 1st this detachment was at Five Mile Run,
between Trenton and Princeton. Early on the morning of the 2d Cornwallis
set out from Princeton, where he had halted the night previous.
The Americans retired before him, disputing every foot of ground. Hand's
riflemen, Scott's Virginians, and Forrest's battery bore the brunt of the
fighting. It was nearly noon by the time Shabbakong Creek was reached,
and two hours passed before the British succeeded in crossing it. The
main portion of the American army was strongly posted on the south side
of the Assanpink, the banks being sufficiently high to enable the men in
the rear to fire over the heads of those in front of them. As the British
approached Trenton, troops were sent forward by Washington to support
the Americans. A battery placed on a hill beyond Trenton held the British
in check for a short time, but the Americans were soon driven into the
town and across the bridge. The cannonading on both sides was heavy,
but the British were unable to force their way across the stream, and as
night approached Cornwallis, against the advice of his officers, withdrew
his troops, determined to renew the conflict in the morning. "If ever
there was a crisis in the affairs of the Revolution", wrote Wilkinson, "this
was the moment. Thirty minutes would have sufficed to have brought the
two armies into contact, and thirty minutes more would have decided the
combat." Washington's position was indeed critical. It was hardly possible
that with his raw levies he could continue to hold in check the well-disciplined
troops of Cornwallis, which in the morning would be reinforced
with troops he had left at Maidenhead and Princeton. The Delaware behind
Washington was full of floating ice, and to cross it in that condition
was impossible. If Cornwallis should force the Americans' position, the
victory of the British would be decisive. Immediately after dark a council of
war was held. It was then decided to turn the left flank of the enemy, strike
a blow at Princeton, where the garrison was small, and march on Brunswick,
the depository of the British stores. The sentries of both armies were
posted along the banks of the Assanpink, and at some points were within
one hundred and fifty yards of each other. Working parties were sent
within hearing distance of the enemy to throw up intrenchments, the
guards were doubled, and everything was done to indicate that Washington
intended to defend his position to the last. But at midnight the fires were
replenished and the troops silently withdrawn. Marching by the Quaker
road, Washington turned the left flank of Cornwallis, and by daybreak
reached a point directly south of Princeton. With the main body he moved
directly on the town, and ordered a detachment under Mercer to march to
the left and demolish the bridge over Stony Brook, thus destroying direct
communication with Cornwallis. The garrison at Princeton consisted of
the 17th, 40th, and 55th regiments and three companies of light horse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
The 17th and 55th, with a few dragoons, started at sunrise on the morning
of the 3d to join Cornwallis. The 17th, under Colonel Mawhood, had
crossed the bridge over Stony Brook, that Mercer was to destroy, and was
some distance beyond it, when Mawhood discovered Mercer on his flank
and rear, moving north on the east side of the stream. He at once recrossed
the bridge, and both parties endeavored to gain the high ground
east of the stream. As the Americans had the shortest distance to march,
they were successful, and with their rifles they poured a deadly fire into the
17th and 55th, as they advanced to drive them from their position. They
had no bayonets, however, and were unable to stand the charge of the British.
They fled through an orchard in their rear, leaving their commander
mortally wounded on the ground. It was not until Mawhood emerged from
the orchard that he was aware that the whole American army was within
supporting distance of the troops he had just engaged. On hearing the
firing on his left, Washington halted his column, and with the Pennsylvania
militia moved to the support of Mercer. Encouraged by the irresolution
of the militia, Mawhood charged them, but other regiments coming up and
the militia gaining confidence, the British halted, and then fled, as the
Americans in turn advanced against them. The 55th retreated to Princeton
and joined the 40th. They made a mere show of defending the town,
took refuge in the college building, deserted it, and were soon seen in full
retreat across the Millstone towards Brunswick. Washington's troops had
been under arms for over eighteen hours, and were too much fatigued to
follow them. Having dispersed the 17th regiment, he destroyed the
bridge over Stony Brook and Millstone as the head of Cornwallis's rear-guard
came in sight. It was commanded by Leslie, who had marched from
Maidenhead as soon as he heard the firing in his rear. Washington turned
north at Kingston, and proceeded to Somerset Court-House, where he
rested his men. Cornwallis was not aware that the Americans had been
withdrawn from his front until he heard the sound of the guns at Princeton.
Realizing at once that he had been outgeneralled, and that his stores
were in danger, he ordered a retreat. Failing to reach Princeton in time
to be of service, he continued his march to Brunswick, and made no attempt
to follow Washington. The losses of the British in these engagements
were severe; those on the 2d of January were never known. At Princeton,
Washington estimated that one hundred men were left dead upon the
field, and that the killed, wounded, and prisoners amounted to five hundred.
Ensign Inman, of the 17th, wrote that of the two hundred and twenty-four
rank and file of his regiment, which set out on the morning of the 3d, one
hundred and one were either killed or wounded, and that he was the only
officer of the right wing not injured. The Americans lost only twenty or
thirty privates, but many officers. Bravely had they urged their men on
in the thickest of the fight. That Washington escaped seemed a miracle to
those who saw him lead the troops which drove Mawhood back. Hazlet,
Morris, Neal, and Shippin fell upon the field. Mercer, mortally wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
died upon the 12th, lamented by the whole country. From Somerset Court-House
Washington marched to Morristown, where he went into winter-quarters.
The British troops were soon all withdrawn to Amboy and Brunswick.
In less than three weeks Washington had turned back the tide of adversity,
and had compelled his opponents to evacuate West Jersey.</p>

<p>Washington remained at Morristown from the 7th of January until the
28th of May, during which time no military movement of importance took
place. His men left for their homes as soon as their terms of service
expired, and as few militia entered the camp to take their places, at times
it seemed as if the army would be so reduced as to be unworthy of the
name. It was not until late in the spring that the new levies reached headquarters.
On the 28th of May the Americans marched to Middlebrook,
and took position behind the Raritan. On the 13th of June Howe marched
from Brunswick and extended his line to Somerset Court-House, and
Arnold was sent to Trenton to take measures to prevent his crossing the
Delaware. The militia turned out in a spirited manner, and Howe did not
care to advance in the face of the opposition they could offer, with Washington
on his flank. He endeavored to bring on a general engagement
with the latter, but Washington refused to leave the strong position he
occupied, and Howe retired to Amboy.</p>

<p>Early in April Howe had settled upon a campaign having for its object
the capture of Philadelphia. He determined to embark his troops and
transport them to the banks of the Delaware or Chesapeake, and march
directly on the city. With the object of reaching the fleet he started to
cross to Staten Island; but learning that Washington was at Quibbletown,
he recalled his men and proceeded to Westfield, hoping to outflank him.
But, as Washington retired, Howe was unsuccessful, and finally passed
over to Staten Island, totally evacuating New Jersey.</p>

<p>For over six weeks Washington was ignorant of Howe's intentions. Supposing
that he would endeavor to coöperate with Burgoyne, and would sail
up the Hudson, Washington moved his army to Ramapo, in New York. On
the 23d of July, after Howe's troops had been three weeks on the vessels,
the fleet sailed, shaping its course southwesterly. Its departure was
promptly reported to Congress. Signal fires were lighted along the Jersey
coast as it was seen from time to time by those who were watching for it,
and messengers carried inland the news of its progress. At last, on the
30th, it was spoken off the capes of Delaware, but Lord Howe deemed it
too hazardous to sail up that river, and after consulting with his brother,
the general, continued on his course southward. On the 15th of August he
entered Chesapeake Bay, and on the 25th the troops were landed at Elk
Ferry.</p>

<p>On the 24th of July Washington heard that the fleet had sailed southward,
and in consequence marched his army from Ramapo to Coryell's Ferry.
He continued his march to Philadelphia, when he learned that the fleet
was off the capes of Delaware; but as it was soon lost sight of, he retraced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
his steps, and halted in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, twenty miles from
Philadelphia. While there, Lafayette, De Kalb, and Pulaski joined the
army.</p>

Flaxman, in St. Paul's, London.</p>
</div></div>

<p>For a while everything was
in suspense. Concluding at last
that Howe had sailed for Charleston,
Washington consulted with
his officers, and decided to return
to the Hudson, so that Burgoyne
could be opposed or New York
attacked, as circumstances should
direct. He was just about to do
this when word was brought that
the fleet had entered Chesapeake
Bay, and was at least two hundred
miles from the capes. This
news created great consternation
in Philadelphia, but the excitement
was not as great as it had
been the previous winter, when
Howe was at Trenton. Repeated
alarms had made the people callous,
and internal political differences
continued to divide them.
Besides this, the pacific influence which the presence of a large Quaker
population exercised seemed to bear down all military efforts. Stirring appeals
were made by the authorities, new bodies of militia were ordered to be
raised, handbills calculated to arouse the people were issued, but all with
unsatisfactory results. To impress the lukewarm with the strength of his
forces, and to inspire hopes in the breasts of the patriotic, on the 24th of
August Washington marched his army through the streets of Philadelphia.
The men were poorly armed and clothed, and to give them some uniformity
they wore sprigs of green in their hats.</p>

<p>The Americans halted south of Wilmington, and a picked corps under
Maxwell was thrown to the front. The country below was patrolled by parties
of Delaware militia under Rodney, and Washington reconnoitred it in
person. The disembarkation of Howe's army on the 25th was watched by
a few militia, who fled when a landing was effected. Howe's men were in
good health, but hundreds of his horses had died on the voyage, and those
that survived were little better than carrion. His advance, therefore, was
slow. He moved in two columns, one on each side of Elk River. Several
days were spent in collecting horses, and on the 3d of September the columns
joined at Aitken's tavern. Here a severe skirmish took place with
Maxwell's corps, which was driven back. Washington's force then lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
behind Red Clay Creek, his left resting on Christiana Creek, and extending
in the direction of Newport. On the 8th the British advanced as if to attack
the American left, but by night Washington learned that the greater part
of Howe's army was at Milltown, on his right. Fearing that Howe would
push past him in that direction, cross the Brandywine, and gain the road
to Philadelphia, Washington, on the evening of the 8th, quietly withdrew
his troops from Red Clay Creek, and threw them in front of Howe, at
Chad's Ford, on the Brandywine. A redoubt, commanded by Proctor, was
thrown up on the east bank to protect the crossing. Wayne's division,
formerly Lincoln's, was within supporting distance, and Greene's, still further
to the rear, was to act as a reserve. The Pennsylvania militia, under
Armstrong, formed the left wing. They were posted at the fords below
Chad's, which were easily protected. The right wing was commanded by
Sullivan. It was composed of his own division and those of Stirling and
Stephen. Both Washington and Sullivan were unacquainted with the country
to their right, and supposed that, when they guarded the fords three
miles above where Sullivan was stationed, the enemy could not approach
from that direction without their receiving timely notice.</p>

<p>The British marched from Milltown to Kennett Square. On the morning
of the 11th, Knyphausen with 7,000 men took the direct road to Chad's
Ford. He skirmished with Maxwell, who had crossed the stream to meet
him, and drove him back over the Brandywine. At daybreak on the same
day, another column, 7,000 strong, set out from Kennett Square. It was
commanded by Cornwallis, and Howe accompanied it in person. It took
a road leading north to a point above the forks of the Brandywine, turned
to the east, crossed the west branch at Trimble's Ford and the east at
Jeffrey's, and then moved south. The plan was that Knyphausen should
engage the attention of the Americans in front until Cornwallis had gained
a position to attack their right. In this Knyphausen was successful, his
attempts to cross the Brandywine at Chad's Ford being only feints.</p>

<p>About noon Washington heard of Cornwallis's march. He promptly determined
to cross the stream and engage Knyphausen, while Cornwallis was
too far distant to reinforce him or threaten the American right. Wayne,
Greene, and Sullivan's divisions were ordered to advance. Greene had gained
the west bank when word was received from Sullivan that a Major Spear
had assured him that there must be some mistake. He had that morning
passed over the road Cornwallis was said to be on, and had seen nothing of
him. Fearing that Cornwallis's march was only a feint, and that he had
returned and rejoined Knyphausen, Washington ordered Greene back and
sent scouts out for additional information. By two o'clock it was obtained.
Cornwallis was discovered on the road to Dilworth, and would soon be in
the rear of the Americans. Stirling and Stephen were deployed on the
hill southwest of Birmingham Meeting-House, and Sullivan's division was
ordered to join them. Before it could reach its position Cornwallis began
the attack. As he attempted to turn the American right, Sullivan endeavored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
to move his three divisions to the east. His own division had been
formed in line half a mile from those of Stirling and Stephen, and in closing
the gap it fell into confusion and was routed. With the divisions of Stirling
and Stephen, Sullivan made every effort to hold the position; but he was
outnumbered, his left flank was uncovered, and his entire command was
finally driven in confusion from the field. Sullivan, Stirling, and Conway
had encouraged their men with exhibitions of personal bravery, and Lafayette,
who acted as a volunteer, was wounded while endeavoring to rally
some fugitives. When Washington heard the firing in the direction of
Birmingham he rode thither with the utmost speed. Meeting the fugitives,
he ordered Greene to support the right wing. The order was executed
with wonderful promptness. Greene, throwing Weedon's brigade
on the flank of the enemy and Muhlenberg's in their front, checked the
pursuit. But the Americans were obliged to fall back until they came to
a narrow defile, flanked on both sides by woods, from which the British
could not drive them, and night ended the conflict. When Knyphausen
learned that Cornwallis was engaged he pushed across the stream at Chad's
Ford, but Wayne, Maxwell, and Proctor held him in check until they found
that the right wing had been defeated, when they retired in good order,
fighting as they fell back towards Chester. There at night the defeated
army gathered, and Washington reported to Congress that, notwithstanding
the misfortunes of the day, his troops were in good spirits.</p>

<p>The American loss was about one thousand, killed, wounded, and prisoners;
that of the British, five hundred and seventy-nine. That the conduct
of the Americans inspired their opponents with respect is shown
by the language of Sir William Howe in summarizing the opposition he
had met with up to this time. "They fought the king's army", he wrote,
"on Long Island; they sustained the attack at Fort Washington; they
stood the battle at Brandywine: and our loss upon those occasions, though
by no means equal to theirs, was not inconsiderable."</p>

<p>The day after the battle Washington marched from Chester to Philadelphia.
He rested his army two days at Germantown, and then recrossed
the Schuylkill; public opinion demanding that another battle should be
risked before the city should be given up. On the 16th the two armies
met on the high ground south of Chester Valley and prepared for action.
The skirmishing had actually begun, when a violent storm stopped the
engagement by ruining the ammunition of both armies. Washington
withdrew to the hills north of the valley, and finding it impossible to repair
the damage done by the storm, retreated again over the Schuylkill, leaving
Wayne behind him to watch the enemy and attack their rear should they
attempt to follow. Wayne was to have been reinforced by detachments
under Smallwood and Gist, which did not reach him. When the British
moved nearer to the Lancaster road, Wayne took position in their rear.
He supposed that they were ignorant of his presence, and wrote to Washington
to that effect. But on the night of the 20th he was attacked by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
strong detachment under Major-General Grey, and although he had taken
measures to guard against a surprise, the onslaught was so sudden that his
men, who were sleeping on their arms, were
unable to make an effective resistance, and
about one hundred and fifty were either killed
or wounded by the bayonet.</p>

<p>Howe on the 21st resumed his march towards
Philadelphia. Finding that the Americans had
thrown up intrenchments at Swedes Ford, he
turned up the river as if to cross above. Washington
feared that it was his intention to strike
at Reading, where his stores were deposited,
and to protect them marched in the same direction
on the opposite side of the river. When
he reached Potts Grove, now Pottstown, he discovered
that Howe, by a retrograde movement
on the night of the 22d, had crossed at Fatland and Gordon's fords, and
was in full march for Philadelphia.</p>

<p>On the day of the battle of
Brandywine the citizens of Philadelphia
heard the sound of cannon
in the west, and gathered in
the streets to discuss and wonder
what the future would bring forth.
At night a messenger arrived with
news of the disaster. Everything
was in confusion, and when, on
the morning of the 19th, about
one o'clock, a letter was received
from Colonel Hamilton stating
that the British were marching on
the city, the members of Congress
were aroused from their beds, and
departed in haste for Lancaster,
where they had agreed to meet
should their removal from Philadelphia
become necessary.</p>

<p>"It was a beautiful still moonlight
night, and the streets as full of
men, women, and children as on
a market day." The alarm was premature, but on the 25th Howe's army
encamped at Germantown. Through Thomas Willing, a leading citizen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
of Philadelphia, the inhabitants were promised by Sir William Howe that
if they should remain peaceably in their dwellings they would not be
molested. The next morning, Cornwallis, with three thousand men, took
possession of the city. The troops marched down Second Street to the
music of "God save the King", and were greeted by some of the inhabitants
with "acclamations of joy", but the people generally "appeared sad
and serious." Howe immediately began to throw up a line of intrenchments
north of the city, extending from the Delaware to the Schuylkill,
and informed his brother, the admiral, who was in Delaware Bay, that the
army was in possession of the city. The defences of the river prevented
the fleet from approaching, and the day after the occupation an attempt
was made by the American flotilla to cannonade the city. The smaller
vessels were driven off before they had done serious damage, but the
frigate "Delaware" ran aground and was captured.</p>

<p>The main portion of Howe's army remained at Germantown, a village of
a single street, two miles in length, and five from the city. In the centre
stood the market-house, and along the road which there crosses the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
street Howe's army was encamped. The left under Knyphausen reached
to the Schuylkill, the right under Grant and Mathews to the York road.
At the upper end of the town stood the large stone mansion of Benjamin
Chew, late chief justice of the province, and in a field opposite the 40th
Regiment under Colonel Musgrave was encamped. The advance was a
mile beyond at Mount Pleasant, where the second battalion of light infantry
was stationed, with their pickets thrown out at Mount Airy still further on.
After Howe crossed the Schuylkill, Washington marched to Pennybacker's
Mills, and thence to Metutchen
Hills, fifteen miles from Philadelphia.
He had been reinforced
by McDougall's brigade
and other troops; and learning
that Howe had detached
a portion of his command to
reduce the forts on the Delaware,
he determined to attack
him at Germantown. His plan
was to engage the troops at
Mount Pleasant with a portion
of his army, while a large force
under Greene should move
down the Lime Kiln road,
which enters the town from
the east at the market-house,
and attack Grant and Mathews.
At the same time the
Pennsylvania and Jersey militia
were to make demonstrations
on the enemy's left and
right flanks respectively.</p>

<p>Washington moved from his quarters on the evening of October 3d.
Sullivan commanded the troops that were to attack the enemy in front, and
was followed by the reserve under Stirling, which Washington accompanied.
Sullivan arrived at Chestnut Hill on the morning of the 4th at sunrise, and
halted two hours to allow Greene to gain his ground, that the attacks might
be made at the same time. Captain Allen McLane's company and a portion
of Conway's brigade were then ordered to advance. They drove the
guard at Mount Airy back on the light infantry, and held them in check<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
while Sullivan formed his line. Wayne's division was on the east of the road,
Sullivan's on the west. The whole under Sullivan then moved forward,
driving the light infantry before them. A thick fog enveloped everything,
and the men could not see forty yards in front of them. But Wayne's
men dashed on, calling to each other to remember Paoli and crying for
vengeance. The light infantry were reinforced by the 40th Regiment
under Musgrave. Just then Howe rode up, calling out: "For shame,
light infantry! I never saw you retreat before." But he found the attack
was general, and rode back to the main line. Down the main street and
past Chew's house Sullivan and Wayne pursued the flying troops. But
here the rout of the British was checked by Agnew, who hastened forward
with a portion of the left wing. As the reserve passed Chew's house they
were fired upon by six companies of the 40th that had taken refuge there
with their commander Musgrave. Stirling endeavored to dislodge them,
but the effort was futile. Lieutenant-Colonel John Laurens and Major
Louis Fleury daringly attempted to fire the house, but were unsuccessful.
While this was going on, Greene made his attack on the right wing. His
march had taken half an hour longer than anticipated, while he still met the
enemy sooner than planned, as their first battalion of light infantry had
been moved forward the night before on the Lime Kiln road. Greene
attempted to advance in line of battle, but his line was thrown into confusion.
He drove a portion of the troops back to the market-house, but
when he encountered Grant he was obliged to retire, and a part of his command
was captured. Woodford's brigade wandered so far from Greene's
right as to reach the rear of Chew's house. It was then directly behind
Wayne's division, and when the brigade fired on the house Wayne's men
retired, as they supposed the enemy were in their rear. This uncovered
Sullivan's flank, and he too was obliged to fall back. The British pursued
until Whitemarsh was reached, where Wayne checked them with a battery
posted on the hill, near the church. The Americans lost nearly eleven
hundred killed, wounded, and prisoners; the British, five hundred and
twenty-one. The American General Nash, of North Carolina, and the
British General Agnew were mortally wounded. While the Americans
were defeated in their object, the moral results of the battle were in their
favor. It inspired them with confidence, and showed the world that though
driven from the field of Brandywine they were still aggressive.</p>

<p>It was now evident to Howe that he must open communication with
New York by water, or his army would be in a state of siege. His attention
was therefore turned to the defences of the Delaware which were held
by the Americans. The most formidable of these was Fort Mifflin, situated
on an island in the river a short distance below the mouth of the
Schuylkill. Opposite this, at Red Bank, on the Jersey shore, was Fort Mercer,
while four or five miles below, at Billingsport, was another fortification.
Opposite these points <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> were sunk in the channel, which
were protected by the batteries and by a fleet of small vessels, known as
the Pennsylvania navy, commanded by Commodore John Hazelwood. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
these, there were several larger vessels which had been built by order
of Congress.</p>

<p>On the 19th of October Howe withdrew his troops from Germantown
and encamped them behind his lines of intrenchments on the north side of
the city. Before this he had erected batteries to attack Fort Mifflin. He
now sent a body of men, under Colonel Stirling, over the river from Chester
to capture the fort at Billingsport. The garrison there was not sufficient
for the defence of the fort, and as the British approached they evacuated
the post. By the 21st Admiral Howe succeeded in passing the lower
<i>chevaux-de-frise</i>, and his vessels sailed up the river to a point nearly opposite
Fort Mifflin. On the same day three battalions of Hessians, with
artillery, crossed into Jersey from Philadelphia to attack Fort Mercer.
They arrived before the fort on the afternoon of the 22d. It was commanded
by Colonel Christopher Greene, of Rhode Island, who had with
him but six hundred men. The fortifications were unfinished, but a strong
redoubt, with an abatis, had been constructed. Donop summoned the garrison
to surrender, and upon receiving a refusal formed his regiments for
the attack. They rushed upon the embankments and passed the abandoned
lines with little opposition. But when they charged the redoubt,
they were met with a fire that nearly filled the ditches with killed and
wounded. Most of the men retired in confusion, and those who attempted
to scale the works were beaten back in a hand-to-hand conflict. It was
intended that the fleet should coöperate with Donop; that the "Vigilant",
with sixteen 24-pounders, should pass to the west of Fort Mifflin, while
other vessels should engage Hazelwood and prevent his offering assistance
to Greene. The plan failed, however, at all points. The "Vigilant"
could not sail up the west channel, and Hazelwood was more than
a match for the vessels sent against him. He drove them back, while
some of his boats sailed close to the shore and poured an effective fire into
the flank of Donop's column. It was in vain that Donop and his officers
re-formed the men and led them back to the attack. They were shot down
in scores as they attempted to remove the abatis, and in three quarters of
an hour from the time the engagement opened the men withdrew for the
last time, leaving Donop behind them, mortally wounded. He died three
days afterwards, "finishing", to use his own words, "a noble career early."
His command had numbered about twenty-five hundred men, one sixth of
whom were either killed or wounded. The Americans had but fourteen
killed and twenty-three wounded. Two of the vessels which had been sent
against Hazelwood, the "Augusta" and the "Merlin", ran aground, and
were discovered in that position by the Americans on the 22d. They were
at once attacked, and the magazine of the "Augusta" exploded with terrific
force. She had been set on fire either by accident or by a shot from the
American batteries, and blew up before all of her crew could be removed.
It was found impossible to save the "Merlin", and she was fired by her
officers and destroyed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>Taught caution by these reverses, Howe made no further effort to capture
the forts until he had succeeded in erecting a number of batteries on
the Pennsylvania shore within range of Fort Mifflin. On the 10th of November
these were opened with serious result to the Americans. The
reply from the fort was spirited, and the damage done to it in daytime was
repaired during the night. On the first day, Colonel Samuel Smith, of
Maryland, who commanded the garrison, was wounded, and was taken to
Red Bank. The second in command, Lieutenant-Colonel Russell, was
relieved, on account of ill-health, by Major Simeon Thayer, of Rhode Island,
and the defence of the fort was continued. On the 15th the "Vigilant",
carrying sixteen 24-pounders, and a hulk with three guns of the same capacity,
succeeded in passing up the west channel and taking the fort in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
rear, while other vessels engaged the fleet. The fort by this time was little
more than a mass of ruins. The ammunition was nearly exhausted. Major
Fleury, the engineer of the fort, and Major Talbot were wounded; nearly
all the guns were dismounted, and whenever the men appeared on the platforms
they were picked off by sharpshooters in the shrouds of the vessels.
During the night of the 15th the garrison was removed to Red Bank, as
preparations were being made to storm the place the next day, and on the
morning of the 16th the British took possession of the place. The gallant
defence of this fort by about three hundred men called forth commendations
from all sides. Swords were voted to Hazelwood and Smith by Congress,
while Fleury and Thayer were promoted. Fort Mercer was now the
only water-defence held by the Americans. With the object of capturing
it, on the 18th Cornwallis marched to Chester and crossed to Billingsport.
Greene was sent to oppose him, and crossed the Delaware at Bristol; but
before he could render any assistance to Varnum, who commanded the
troops on the Jersey side of the river, that officer was obliged to retire
before Cornwallis and abandon Fort Mercer, which the British now destroyed.
Lafayette, who was with Greene, made a spirited attack on a body
of Hessians encamped near Gloucester, for which he gained considerable
credit. The majority of the small vessels of the Pennsylvania navy succeeded
in passing up the river by the batteries that Howe had erected at
Philadelphia, but the larger ones, together with nearly all those built by
Congress, were destroyed.</p>

<p>A few days after the fall of Fort Mifflin the British transports made
their way up to Philadelphia, and to some extent relieved the distress that
the scarcity of provisions occasioned. About the end of October Washington
removed his headquarters to Whitemarsh, and on November 24th reconnoitred
the enemy's lines with a view to attack them. A majority of
his officers, however, opposed the plan. It was soon evident that Sir William
Howe was about to resume the offensive, and Greene was recalled from
Jersey. On the evening of December 4th, Howe, with nearly all his army,
marched out of Philadelphia with the avowed intention of driving Washington
over the mountains. His advance-guard arrived at Chestnut Hill about
daylight the next morning. General James Irvine with the Pennsylvania
militia met them at the foot of the hill, and, after a sharp skirmish, the
militia fled, leaving Irvine wounded in the hands of the British. When
Howe arrived in front of Washington's lines he found them so strong that
he did not dare to attack them, and after spending four days in endeavoring
to gain a position that would compel Washington to attack him, he suddenly
gave up the design and returned to the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>As the season was advancing, and the Americans were in no condition
to keep the field, it was decided to go into winter-quarters at Valley Forge,
on the west side of the Schuylkill, where the Valley Creek empties into the
river. The surrounding hills were covered with woods and presented an
inhospitable appearance. The choice was severely criticised, and De Kalb
described it as a wilderness. But the position was central and easily
defended. The army arrived there about the middle of December, and the
erection of huts began. They were built of logs, and were fourteen by
fifteen feet each. The windows were covered with oiled paper, and the
openings between the logs were closed with clay. The huts were arranged
in streets, giving the place the appearance of a city. It was the first of the
year, however, before they were occupied, and previous to that the suffering
of the army had become great. Although the weather was intensely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
cold the men were obliged to work at the buildings, with nothing to support
life but flour mixed with water, which they baked into cakes at the open
fires. "My brigade's out of provisions, nor can the commissary obtain any
meat", wrote Huntington on the 22d of December. "Three days successively
we have been destitute of bread", said Varnum the same day,
"and two days we have been entirely without meat." Soap, vinegar, and
other articles necessary for the health of the men were never furnished, and
so imperfectly did the clothier-general perform his duties that many of
the men were without shirts, and hundreds were confined to the hospitals
and farm-houses for want of shoes. Blankets and proper coverings were
so scarce that numbers, after toiling during the day, were obliged to sit by
the fires all night to keep from freezing. By the 23d of December two
thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight men were unfit for duty, because
they were barefoot and otherwise naked. The horses died of starvation by
hundreds, and the men were obliged to haul their own provisions and
firewood. As straw could not be found to protect the men from the cold
ground, sickness spread through their quarters with fearful rapidity. "The
unfortunate soldiers", wrote Lafayette, in after-years, "were in want of
everything; they had neither coats, hats, shirts, nor shoes; their feet and
their legs froze till they became black, and it was often necessary to amputate
them.... The army frequently remained whole days without provisions,
and the patient endurance of both soldiers and officers was a miracle
which each moment served to renew." At times, however, it seemed as if
the forbearance of the men was exhausted, and that the war would end in
mutiny. But the officers succeeded in allaying the feelings of discontent,
and under the management of Greene, who assumed the duties of quarter-master-general
on the 23d of March, a change for the better took place.</p>

<p>While the country around Valley Forge was so impoverished by the
military operations of the previous summer as to make it impossible for it
to support the army, the sufferings of the latter were chiefly owing to the
inefficiency of Congress. That body met at Lancaster after leaving Philadelphia,
and at once adjourned to York, where its sessions were continued.
But it in no way equalled the congresses which had preceded it. "The
Continental Congress and the currency", wrote Gouverneur Morris in 1778,
"have greatly depreciated." Many of the members entertained the widespread
fear of a standing army, and refused to follow the advice given by
Washington for the relief of the men who defended them. Some of the
delegates, indeed, did not hesitate to criticise the judgment of Washington,
and question his abilities. The capture of Burgoyne gave them an opportunity
of comparing the results of the Northern and Southern campaigns.
In writing of Washington's army a member of Congress said to Gates:
"We have had a noble army melted down by ill-judged marches, which
disgrace their authors and directors, and which have occasioned the
severest and most just sarcasm and contempt of our enemies. How much
you are to be envied, my dear general! How different your conduct and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
your fortune! In short, this army will be totally lost unless you come
down and collect the virtuous band, who wish to fight under your banner,
and with their aid save the southern hemisphere. Congress must send for
you." "I am weary", exclaimed John Adams, "with so much insipidity."
"I am sick of Fabian systems in all quarters." It was a matter for thanksgiving,
he thought, that the credit of defending the Delaware was "not
immediately due to the commander-in-chief nor to Southern troops. If
it had been, idolatry and adulation would have been unbounded." The
prevalence of these sentiments made it easy for disappointed soldiers like
Mifflin and Conway to spread dissensions which, if they had been allowed
to grow, would have brought about the removal of Washington. Mifflin's
eloquence and abilities as a politician far exceeded his merits in the field;
and he was jealous of the preference shown by Washington for Greene and
Knox. Conway aspired to a major-generalship, and was chagrined that
Washington opposed him. If Washington had been removed and Lee or
Gates appointed in his place, Mifflin and Conway would have been benefited
by the change. The schemes of the last two were warmly supported by
James Lovell and Dr. Benjamin Rush, and the most insidious measures
were entered upon to undermine the reputation of Washington. Anonymous
letters were circulated for this purpose, and the country was made to
ring with the cry that, under a Gates, a Lee, or a Conway, the Southern
army would be victorious. Through the influence of this faction, Gates
was made president of the Board of War, of which Mifflin was a member,
and authority which belonged to the commander-in-chief was vested in it.
To separate Lafayette from Washington, and gain for themselves the influence
of his name, the "Cabal", as it has been called, proposed an impracticable
winter campaign against Canada, which Lafayette was to command,
with Conway to assist him. But here the faction spent its strength. The
friends of Washington had been put on their guard by the disclosure of a
correspondence which showed the malignity of his enemies. Wilkinson,
who was on Gates's staff, repeated, while his tongue was loosened with wine,
an opinion expressed in a letter that Conway had written to Gates. Gates
read it to his military family. "Heaven has been determined to save your
country", it said, "or a weak general and bad counsellors would have
ruined it." The words reached Washington, who enclosed them to Conway,
simply informing him that he understood they formed a portion of a letter
of his to Gates. It was in vain that the members of the Cabal attempted
at first to carry the matter through with a high hand, then to deny that
such a letter had ever been written, and finally to excuse themselves.
Their ends were discovered and their power was gone. Lafayette would
have nothing to do with the Canadian expedition unless De Kalb was made
his second in command. He repaired to Albany only to find that no measures
had been taken to carry out the promises made him, and as the friends
of Washington were soon in the ascendency in Congress, Lafayette was
recalled to Valley Forge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the advice of a committee which Congress had sent to camp to
inquire into the condition of the army, many defects and abuses were corrected,
and its organization was improved. The new troops that had been
called for came in slowly, but their effectiveness was increased through the
exertion of Baron Steuben, who joined the army about the close of February.
A pupil of Frederick the Great, and a distinguished officer in the
Prussian service, he won the esteem of Congress by offering to serve as a
volunteer. His experience and industry soon instilled a discipline into the
army which it had never known, and in May he was made inspector-general,
with the rank and pay of a major-general.</p>

<p class="p2">While the American army was suffering at Valley Forge the British were
comfortably quartered in Philadelphia. When they first entered the city it
presented a sorry appearance: 590 dwellings and 240 stores were unoccupied;
the leaden spouts of many houses had been taken down to mould
into bullets, and the bells of the churches and public buildings had been
removed to places of safety. The male population between the ages of
eighteen and sixty numbered but 5,335, and of these one fifth were Quakers.
The feelings of the Quaker citizens had been greatly outraged by the
arrest and banishment to the western part of Virginia of a number of their
people. Sullivan had discovered on his march through New Jersey what he
believed to be a treasonable correspondence on their part with the enemy,
and he had forwarded the papers to Congress. The matter had been referred
to the authorities of Pennsylvania, who found in the correspondence,
and in an address issued by the Quaker meeting in December, the grounds
for sending the Quaker leaders into exile. It was but natural that the families
of these men should have looked upon the British as their deliverers
from an outrageous tyranny. But they soon found to their sorrow that their
opposition to war afforded them as little protection from one side as from
the other. The property destroyed by the British was enormous, and a revulsion
of feeling was the consequence. At one time seventeen handsome
houses beyond the lines were set on fire to prevent their being occupied
by the American pickets. Persons living in the neighborhood of the city
were robbed by both parties, and their crops carried off or destroyed. The
temptation to sell their produce for hard money induced some of the neighboring
farmers to supply the enemy with luxuries, though they found access
to the city hazardous. The Americans under Smallwood guarded the roads
leading to Wilmington, while Generals Potter and Lacy scoured the country
west and north of the city. Captains Allen McLane, Clark, and Lee
watched the movements of the enemy and reported them to Washington,
but they could not oppose the large forces that Howe frequently sent out
to protect those who were willing to risk furnishing him with provisions.</p>

<p>The desolation which surrounded the town was soon in striking contrast
with the scenes within. The empty stores were occupied by itinerant traders
from New York, who offered for sale articles of luxury that the war had
driven from the American market. The officers of the army were quartered
on the citizens, and after the campaign closed they gave themselves
up to social enjoyments. Clubs met at the public-houses, and weekly balls
were given at the City Tavern. As many of the officers were men of education
and refinement, they were warmly welcomed in the families of leading
citizens; but there was another class who did much to change the moral
aspect of the city, when, by following the loose example of their commander,
Sir William Howe, they shocked the staid citizens with their immorality.
Cock-fighting and gambling were favorite amusements, and a faro-table kept
by a foreigner proved the ruin of many young officers. The theatre on
South Street was fitted up under directions of Captains André and De
Lancey. Some of the scenes were painted by André. The profits of the
performances were divided among the widows and orphans of the soldiers.
As spring approached, horse-racing was added to the list of amusements.
While citizens of wealth could take part in the gaieties which surrounded
them, those in moderate circumstances suffered privations. Firewood was
extremely scarce and provisions high. "Nothing but hard money will pass",
wrote a resident to a relative outside of the lines. "There is plenty of
goods, but little money among the tradespeople. The market is poor. I
received the butter by J&mdash;&mdash;; we are no longer accustomed to eat butter on
our bread. I keep it to make water soup, which we have nearly every day."
The army of occupation, on the other hand, was plentifully supplied with
military stores after the defences on the Delaware were captured.</p>

<p>Martial law ruled supreme. The appointment of Joseph Galloway to be
superintendent of police and the designation of magistrates under him
were the only steps taken towards the revival of civil authority, and Galloway
received his orders from headquarters.</p>

<p>The supineness of Howe robbed the British of all the benefits that might
have resulted from the capture of Philadelphia. Attempts were made to
raise regiments of loyalists, but so little support did the scheme receive
that it was only partially successful. The "Pennsylvania Loyalists", of
which William Allen, Jr., was colonel, and the "Queen's Rangers", commanded
by Lieutenant-Colonel Simcoe, were the most efficient of these
corps. No attempt was made to drive Washington's half-starved forces
from their camp, although their condition was perfectly well known to
Howe through the deserters that flocked to the city. The military movements
of Howe while in Philadelphia were confined to foraging expeditions
and attacks on isolated posts that could be surprised and broken up with
little danger of loss. While these were successful, they gave to the war a
predatory character that reflected little credit on British arms, and intensified
the bitterness entertained for all representatives of royal authority.</p>

<p>The British government, dissatisfied with the results of Howe's campaigns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
decided early in 1778 upon his recall. Sir Henry Clinton, his successor,
arrived in Philadelphia the 8th of May, and on the 18th an entertainment
was given by the officers of the army in honor of the retiring
commander. The fête was styled the "Mischianza", and consisted of a
regatta, a mock tournament, and a ball. But "Knights of the Burning
Mountain" and of the "Blended Rose", with squires and ladies decked
with spangles and ribbons, could not disguise the fact that the royal army
had failed in accomplishing the task assigned to it, and the chagrin of its
veterans was deepened by the frivolous scenes which marked the retirement
of Sir William Howe.</p>

<p>The alliance with France made it necessary for the British to contract
their operations, and Sir Henry Clinton brought with him orders to evacuate
Philadelphia. His intention of doing so became known to Washington,
and that his information might be more certain he ordered Lafayette,
with a body of two thousand four hundred men, the flower of the army, to
cross the Schuylkill and take a position near the city. This movement was
made on the very day of the Mischianza, and on the morning of the 19th
Howe learned that Lafayette was at Barren Hill, twelve miles distant.
Clinton had not yet assumed command, and in the hope of closing his career
in America by a brilliant stroke, Howe determined to make an effort to
capture the young Frenchman and his detachment. So confident was he
of doing this, that, before leaving the city, he invited his friends to meet
Lafayette, whom he promised to bring with him on his return, while his
brother, the admiral, prepared a vessel in which to take the distinguished
captive to England. On the night of the 19th Grant, with five thousand
men, marched by way of Frankford and Oxford, and by morning he had
gained a point on the Swedes Ford road two miles in the rear of Lafayette.
Another detachment, under Grey, was sent by way of Chestnut Hill
to attack Lafayette's flank; while the main portion of the army, under
Howe, took the Ridge road, to attack him in front. Lafayette's position
was on high ground, and was naturally strong. Neither Grey nor Howe
could approach him without his being aware of their advance. In his rear
were two roads. One led along the riverside to Matson's Ford, three miles
distant; the other along a ridge, a short distance from the river, to Swedes
Ford, still higher up. The ground between the roads was heavily wooded.
Had Grant, who held the Swedes Ford road, sent a portion of his force
to Matson's Ford (which he could have done by a cross-road), Lafayette's
only line of retreat would have been destroyed. But in place of doing
this he marched down the Swedes Ford road to attack the American rear.
Through the carelessness of his scouts, Lafayette was ignorant of Grant's
position. He was preparing his force to receive Howe, when he heard
of the column advancing from Chestnut Hill. He had just faced a portion
of his troops in that direction when he learned that Grant was in
his rear. Lafayette's danger was now apparent, but he was equal to the
occasion. Without losing a moment, he sent troops through the woods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
with orders to allow themselves to be seen at times by Grant, and lead
him to suppose that they were the advance-guards of larger numbers.
He also left a small body to engage the attention of Howe and Grey, and
then silently marched his detachment along the river road, below Grant, to
Matson's Ford. Grant was entirely deceived. He halted his men, reconnoitred
the troops seen in the woods, and then pushed on to Barren Hill,
where he met the other columns and discovered that Lafayette had escaped.
The British pursued him to the ford, but by the time they reached it Lafayette
had drawn up his force on the other side, and his rear-guard could
be seen following him, dotting the river like the corks of a seine. Fearing
that Lafayette had been reinforced by the entire American army, Howe
made no attempt to follow him, but returned to the city, and on the 24th
sailed for England.</p>

<p>The evacuation of Philadelphia was now only a question of time, and the
news that it had been decided upon was appalling to the Tory citizens who
had openly committed themselves to the royal side. In their despair they
offered to raise three thousand men, if two thousand of the royal army could
be left in addition, to protect the city. Howe had advised some of them to
make terms with Congress, but those who had been most active in serving
him decided to leave with the army. One hundred and eighty transports
arrived in the Delaware, and such diligence was used in loading them that
for days light carts drawn by soldiers, and every kind of carriage, from
wagons to wheelbarrows, were constantly rolling between the houses and
the river. As fast as the transports received their cargoes they dropped
down the river. The defences were dismantled. On the 30th of May
bodies of troops were thrown across the Delaware to protect the passage
of the army. Everything was now ready for the departure of the British,
but the final movement was delayed for a few days on account of the arrival
of the commissioners appointed under the conciliatory bills of Parliament.
At last, on the morning of June 18th, the men were withdrawn from the
lines and marched below the city, where they were embarked upon boats
and taken over to Gloucester. This was done so quietly that many of the
citizens were not aware of the departure of the army until they noticed
the absence of the redcoats in the streets. "They did not go away", wrote
a resident, "they vanished."</p>

<p>By narrowly watching the movements of the enemy Washington was convinced
that it was Clinton's intention to march the greater part of his army
across Jersey. In this opinion he was opposed by the erratic Charles Lee,
who had been exchanged, and had reached the camp. Lee could not believe
that the British would give up Pennsylvania, and argued that it was
more probable that they would strike at Lancaster, or possibly cross the
lower Susquehanna and take up a position on its west bank. Before this,
however, Washington had sent all of the Jersey troops into that State. He
had put them under the command of Maxwell, with directions to coöperate
with Dickinson, who commanded the militia, in opposing any attempt Clinton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
should make to cross the State. On the 18th of June George Roberts
rode at full speed into camp at Valley Forge. He had been at the ferry
over the Schuylkill at Market Street, and citizens on the Philadelphia side
had shouted over the water that the British had gone. They had destroyed
the bridge, so that he was unable to cross, but the intelligence
could be relied upon. Shortly afterwards a letter was received from Captain
Allen McLane confirming the news. He had ridden into the city from
the north, and had picked up some stragglers.</p>

<p>Washington had everything in readiness to move the army at a moment's
notice. Six brigades were immediately put in motion, and the remainder
of the army followed the next day. Crossing the Schuylkill at Valley
Forge, Washington marched directly for Coryell's Ferry on the Delaware,
which he crossed on the 22d. He now sent a picked corps under
Morgan to assist Maxwell. At Hopewell a council of war was held. Lee
opposed any attack, and argued that, on military grounds, rather than
delay the British, he would build a bridge of gold to facilitate their march.
He so successfully urged his views that it was decided to move on a line
parallel with the enemy, and send only a detachment of fifteen hundred
men under Scott to aid Maxwell in annoying their flanks. Greene, Lafayette,
and Wayne protested against the decision of the Council, and as their
views agreed with Washington's, and were supported by Steuben and Du
Portail, Washington determined to attack Clinton if an opportunity offered.
For this purpose he moved his army to Kingston, whence he could strike
at Clinton's line if he attempted to cross the Raritan. He also sent
Wayne with a thousand men and Poor's detachment to join Scott and
Maxwell. The command of this body belonged to Lee, but as he did not
approve of the change in the plans, he declined it in favor of Lafayette.
Subsequently, however, Lee claimed it, and to relieve Washington from an
embarrassing position, and save Lee's feelings, Lafayette magnanimously
yielded. The Jersey militia had turned out in a spirited manner, and under
Dickinson and Forman were doing all in their power to retard Clinton's
advance. They destroyed the bridges as they retired from Haddonfield to
Mount Holly, and filled up the wells so that the enemy could not obtain
water. The heat was intense and the British suffered severely. Clinton
arrived at Crosswicks on the 23d, just in time to save a bridge over the
creek at that place. There he learned that Washington was in Jersey, and
would soon be on his flank if he continued to march in his present direction.
Encumbered as he was with a baggage train twelve miles long,
Clinton knew it would be impossible to protect it in crossing the Raritan.
He determined, therefore, to march by the way of Freehold to the Neversink
Hills, from which place he could embark his army for New York.
Morgan and Maxwell hung on his rear from the time he left Crosswicks,
and to protect his baggage Clinton sent it to the head of the column. As
he approached Freehold, he knew from the frequency with which troops
were seen on his left that he was in close proximity to the American army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
He arrived at Freehold, where the court-house of Monmouth County is
situated, on the morning of the 26th, and there encamped. The head of his
column extended a mile and a half beyond the court-house on the road to
Middletown. His left was on the road just marched over from Crosswicks
to Freehold. The village was entered on the west by a road leading to
Cranberry. It passed over low ground that was intersected by several
swamps and ravines, which, with woods, completely covered the left of
Clinton's line. The American army reached Cranberry, eight miles from
Freehold, on the morning of the 26th. On account of a violent storm it
was obliged to halt there, but the advance under Lee was within five miles
of the enemy. When Washington heard of Clinton's position he ordered
Lee to prepare a plan to attack him as soon as he resumed his march,
unless it should prove that there were strong reasons for his not doing so.
On the evening of the 27th Lee called his officers together only to tell them
that no plan could be decided upon until the field was reached. At sunrise
on the morning of the 28th, Knyphausen, with the baggage, began his
march towards Middletown. At eight o'clock he was followed by the rest
of the army. Scarcely had the rear-guard moved from its ground when it
was fired upon by the militia under Dickinson. The militia were forced to
retire, and as they did so were met by Lee's detachment as it advanced
from Englishtown. On account of conflicting information the Americans
halted for a short time, and then engaged the enemy and drove them
towards their retreating columns. As matters were growing serious, Clinton
reinforced his rear-guard, and the fighting promised to become general.
But Lee had no faith in the ability of the Americans to cope with the
British, and as the latter occupied strong ground he withdrew his men.
From the time Clinton began his march across Jersey, Lee had contended
that all the Americans could hope to do was to fall upon some isolated
party of the enemy and either rout or capture it. To effect this he endeavored
to draw the rear-guard of the British across the ravines intersecting
the low ground west of Freehold, and while they were thus separated from
the main body to defeat them. But his men could not understand his
strategy. As they were withdrawn from one position after another they
lost heart. It seemed to them that they were flying from a shadow, and so
frequently were they ordered back that the retreat became rapid and confused.
When Washington heard that Dickinson had engaged the enemy
he again sent word to Lee to attack them also, unless there were powerful
reasons for the contrary, and he would support him with the entire army.
The day was excessively hot, and the men threw off their knapsacks that
they might march more quickly. As they came to the church which stands
between Englishtown and Freehold, stragglers were met who told them
that Lee was retreating. Unwilling to believe the story, Washington
spurred to the front to learn the truth. After passing the ravine which
borders the low ground we have spoken of, on the west, he met Lee and
his men in full retreat. A stormy scene ensued. Overwhelmed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
indignation which Washington manifested, Lee vainly endeavored to
excuse his conduct. Little time, however, was lost in wasting words.
Calling upon Colonels Stewart and Ramsey, who were near him with their
regiments, to check the enemy, then but two hundred yards distant, Washington
crossed the ravine in his rear, and formed his men as they came up
on its western bank. Greene was placed on the right and Stirling on the
left, while Wayne remained east of the ravine in front of Greene. In this
position a severe engagement took place. Encouraged by the retreat of
Lee, Clinton sent additional reinforcements to his rear, and vainly strove
to drive Washington from his chosen ground. A battery under the Chevalier
de Mauduit Duplessis, planted on an elevation on Greene's right, kept
up an effective fire on the enemy's left, while Wayne repelled a desperate
charge led by Lieutenant-Colonel Monckton, in which that officer fell
at the head of his men. Night ended the conflict, and both parties slept on
the ground which they had occupied. At midnight Clinton withdrew his
troops, and, leaving his dead unburied, resumed his march to Middletown.
He retired so silently that Poor, who lay close to his right, was not aware
of the movement, and on the morning of the 29th the Americans found
themselves alone on the field. By daybreak Clinton was on too strong
ground to be attacked, and after resting his men a few days Washington
marched to the North River, and Clinton embarked for New York.</p>

<p>The battle of Monmouth, as the conflict at Freehold was called, was the
last general engagement fought on Northern soil. The Americans had 229
killed and wounded, the British over 400. Besides this, the latter lost many
by desertion on their march, and numbers fell from the effects of the heat,
which registered ninety-six degrees on the day of the battle.</p>

<p>Lee's conduct would probably have passed unnoticed had he not, in a
letter to Washington, endeavored to defend himself, while he demanded
the grounds which called forth the remarks addressed to him on the battlefield.
The letter was written in a highly improper spirit, and the result
was a court-martial, that found Lee guilty of disobedience of orders, misbehavior
before the enemy, and disrespect of the commander-in-chief. For
these reasons he was suspended from command for twelve months, and before
he was again ordered to service he was dismissed from the army for
having written an impertinent letter to Congress.</p>

<p>Before leaving Valley Forge, Washington directed General Arnold, who
had not fully recovered from the wounds received at Saratoga, to proceed
to Philadelphia and take military command of the city. The duties assigned
him were of a delicate nature. Congress had ordered that when the Americans
took possession of the city no goods should be sold or removed until
their ownership had been decided upon by a properly constituted commission.
The object of this was to secure for the army such goods as the British
and Tories might have abandoned or parted with at nominal prices to
their friends. In his instructions to Arnold, Washington had referred him
to the resolutions of Congress for his guidance, and had urged him to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
every step in his power to preserve tranquillity and give security to individuals
of every class until the restoration of civil power. Arnold arrived
on the morning of the 19th of June, and with the approbation of several
of the principal citizens issued a proclamation that closed the stores and
suspended business. It also commanded the citizens to make returns to
the town major of goods in their possession, beyond those needed for family
use, that the purchasing agents of the army might contract for those they
required. The temptation to benefit himself by the power he now exercised
was greater than Arnold could withstand, and three days after he
issued his first proclamation he entered into an agreement with the clothier-general
of the army and another individual, that all goods purchased for the
public and found to be superfluous should be charged to them and sold for
their joint account. It soon became noised about that Arnold was personally
interested in the purchases ostensibly made for the government, and
although the secret of the agreement was preserved until after his treason,
the knowledge of his speculations in Montreal gave such a color of truth to
the rumor that the community were greatly dissatisfied: besides, he took
up his abode in a spacious mansion on Market Street, formerly the residence
of Governor Penn, which Howe had just vacated, and entered upon
a style of living far beyond his means.</p>

<p>When the exiled Whigs returned to their homes they found the city in
a filthy condition, and its surroundings a scene of desolation. The houses
in the built-up portions of the city were not much injured, but many of
them had been stripped of their furniture, and the papers were filled with
advertisements of missing articles which the owners hoped to recover. The
Supreme Executive Council resumed its sessions in Philadelphia on the 26th
of June. Its patriotic president, Thomas Wharton, Jr., had died at Lancaster
the month previous, and it was presided over by the vice-president,
George Bryan. The Congress assembled more slowly. On the 2d of July
a few delegates gathered in the State House, and two days afterwards celebrated
the anniversary of Independence at the City Tavern; but it was not
until the 7th that a sufficient number were present to conduct business. On
the 12th, Gérard, the French ambassador, arrived. Until a suitable residence
could be found for him he was the guest of Arnold. Congress received
and entertained him on the 6th of August. No opportunity was
lost of honoring the new ally. On the birthday of Louis XVI. the president
and members of Congress called upon his ambassador and offered
their congratulations, and on the 25th were in turn entertained by Gérard.</p>

<p>In the midst of their rejoicings the Whigs did not forget the Tories,
whom they looked upon as promoters of their sufferings. Many of them had
been attainted of treason while the government was at Lancaster, but the
most obnoxious had gone off with the British. Such as remained were summoned
before the authorities, and so great was the clamor against them
that several were executed for aiding the enemy. The new Constitution
had been put into effect, but it was opposed by a number of conscientious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Whigs, and its administration was largely in the hands of new men, who
did not command universal respect. The depreciation of the currency had
also a demoralizing effect. Speculation ran wild, and the greatest extravagance
prevailed. The prices of all kinds of commodities rose to enormous
figures, and the attempts of Congress to regulate them by law and fix the
value of the currency only served to increase the evil. The community was
soon divided into two classes. The Anti-Constitutionalists and the Tories
formed one party; the supporters of the new government the other. The
latter zealously advocated all the measures of Congress, and, classing their
opponents under the one head of "Tories", accused them of being the authors
of all the difficulties that embarrassed the government; it was through
their efforts that traitors were allowed to go unpunished, and the necessaries
of life locked up so that higher prices could be wrung from the people.
"Party disputes and personal quarrels", wrote Washington from Philadelphia,
in December, "are the great business of the day; whilst the momentous
concerns of an empire, a great and accumulating debt, ruined finances,
depreciated money, and want of credit ... are but secondary considerations."
"Our money", he continued, "is now sinking fifty per cent. a day
in this city; and yet an assembly, a concert, a dinner, or a supper, that will
cost three or four hundred pounds, will not only take men off from acting
in this business, but even from thinking of it."</p>

<p>It was in a community thus rent by faction and passion that Arnold commanded.
The early restoration of civil power limited his authority, but his
arrogance soon brought him in conflict with the new government. Unable
to brook the restraint it put upon him, he joined its opponents, and was
soon the centre of a gay and fashionable circle that gladly added so distinguished
a soldier to their number. Arnold at that time was a widower, in
his thirty-eighth year. He was of a susceptible nature, and before long fell
in love with Miss Peggy Shippen, the daughter of Edward Shippen, a leading
lawyer of character and position, whose political opinions caused him to
be numbered among the disaffected. In this company the temptations to
spend money were not easily resisted, and Arnold soon yielded to them.
He gave elegant entertainments, and lived ostentatiously, if not extravagantly.
He was soon involved in debt, and in the hopes of extracting himself
entered into questionable speculations. His quarrel with the state
authorities became more bitter, and in February, 1779, the Council published
a series of charges which were referred to Congress. The committee
who considered them failed to find Arnold guilty of any intentional wrong,
and on the 19th of March he resigned the command of Philadelphia, and on
the 8th of April was married to Miss Shippen. The Pennsylvania authorities
were dissatisfied with the action of the committee of Congress, and succeeded
in having the case reconsidered. After considerable delay, it was
determined that the whole matter should be referred to a court-martial, to
be appointed by the commander-in-chief. The court met in December, and
the following month found Arnold guilty of two of the charges that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
been preferred against him. The most serious one, that of speculating in
goods bought for the public while the stores were closed, was not sustained
for want of evidence, which was not discovered until after his treason. The
acts he was found guilty of were indiscretions rather than crimes; and for
these he was sentenced to be reprimanded by the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>In Nov., 1776, Washington, crossing into New
Jersey,<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> left Lee in command on the New York
side, but Washington, at first requesting, afterwards
instructed Lee to follow him (Sparks's
<i>Washington</i>, iv. 168, 186-7, 193; 5 Force, iii. 779;
<i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, 1872, p. 267). Lee's secret
purpose was to find some excuse for delaying,
and so to prolong his independent command,
with a chance of making a brilliant stroke. He
endeavored at first to quiet Washington's importunities
by detaching a part of Heath's force
at Peekskill, but Heath would take orders only
from Washington (<i>Memoirs</i>).<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> Finally Lee was
moved to follow (Dec. 2d and 3d), and while
crossing Jersey "to reconquer it" he was surprised
at his transient quarters, Dec. 13, 1776,
and captured. Captain Bradford, Lee's aid, gave
Stiles the account which is entered in his diary
(Johnston's <i>Campaign of 1776, Docs.</i>, p. 146, and
<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1860, p. 33).<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a></p>

very unstable. The colonial charter, under the
instigation of Congress (May 10, 1776), had been
overthrown by a convention called in the interests
of the patriot party, which in July had met
to frame a new constitution.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> This, however,
upon its adoption, failed of being effective, by
its opponents' obstructive movements to prevent
the organization of an executive council, so that
in the interim the supreme power, such as it was,
resided in a Council of Safety, which was hampered
in its control of the militia. Such was
the conjunction when fear of an invasion came,
and the Quaker element was passive under the
alarm, and, indeed, antagonistic to measures of
resistance.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a></p>

<p class="pf400">Dr. Moore considers the only picture of Lee which "bears any evidence of authenticity, or answers to the
descriptions given by his contemporary friends and biographers", to be one drawn by Barham Rushbrooke at
the time of Lee's return from Poland, and showing him dressed in the uniform of an aid of King Stanislaus.
It was first engraved in 1813 in Dr. Thomas Gridlestone's treatise to prove that Lee was Junius, and that
writer said of it that, "though designed as a caricature, it was allowed, by all who knew General Lee, to be
the only successful delineation of his countenance or person." It is familiar in prints, representing his extremely
attenuated figure in profile, with a small dog in front of him. It is given in Moore's <i>Treason of Lee</i>;
Gay's <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. 460; in Scull's <i>Evelyns in America</i> (p. 295,&mdash;also see p. 196); and in K. M.

in Dawson (i. 202) Tryon to Germain in <i>N. Y.
Col. Doc.</i> (viii. 694). The effect of the battle in
England to discourage the expatriated loyalists
is told in Hutchinson's <i>Diary</i>, ii. 139. Stedman
accuses Howe of bad judgment in placing so
unfit a man in command as Rahl. Adolphus

have been Arnold's, says that Arnold suggested
to Washington the movement, and Mahon (vi.

Jersey, from the 26th of December, 1776, to the 3d January, 1777, by William Faden</i>. London, 15th April,
1777. This map also makes part of the <i>American Atlas</i>, and the original MS. draft is among the Faden
maps in the library of Congress. The map (the roads being represented by broken lines) bears legends to the
following purport: Washington from his headquarters at Newtown moved his men on the evening of December
25th to 1, and by 4 o'clock on the morning of the 26th he had crossed to 2, where he divided his army
into two divisions. The left, composed of 1,200 men with ten field-pieces under Greene, but accompanied by
Washington himself, proceeded through 3 towards Trenton; the right, under Sullivan, consisting of 1,500 men
with ten field-pieces, went through 4. Meanwhile "Erwin's" and Cadwallader's forces came to 5, hoping to
cross the ferry, but the ice in the river prevented. At 8 o'clock on the morning of the 26th, Rahl at
Trenton was surprised, and the entire force of Hessians with him were captured except 200 men, who, with
some chasseurs and dragoons, escaped to "Burdenton", where they net Count Donop, who now, joined by
these fugitives, proceeded with his command to Crosswicks, thence to Allenstown and Princeton. Washington,
after his victory, encamped at 6, where he was reinforced by troops from Virginia, Maryland, and
Pennsylvania. On January 2d the position was this: Washington had been confronted at 7 by the advance
of Cornwallis at 8. The second brigade of the British under Leslie was at Maidenhead, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Mawhood, with the 17th, 40th, and 55th British regiments, was on the road at 10,&mdash;all these troops
having moved forward from Princeton after Washington's attack at Trenton. During the night of January
2d, Washington having withdrawn his detachments over the bridge, left fires along the southern bank of the
Assumpink Creek to deceive the British, and marched from his camp at 6 to Allenstown, then turned towards
Princeton, but his force in part left the road, and by the dotted line proceeded to 9, and on the morning of
Jan. 3d attacked Mawhood at 10. Of the three British regiments here, the 17th was driven upon Leslie at
Maidenhead, while the 40th and 55th retreated through Princeton and Kingstown towards Brunswick, beyond
12. Washington followed them to Kingstown and encamped there on Jan. 3, after having broken down the
bridge over the Millstone to interfere with Cornwallis's overtaking him. On Jan. 4 Washington took the road
through 11 to the passes in the hills, while Cornwallis, reaching Kingstown the same day, proceeded through
12 towards Brunswick.</p>

officer and 30 men, who joined Donop over the Bordentown road. The two columns of Washington and Sullivan
emerged from the woods at <i>G G</i>. The broken lines (&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;) indicate their line of march and successive
positions, till they surrounded the Hessians. The beginning of the dotted lines (. . . . .) in the village
shows where the Hessians attempted to form; but Rahl and Lossberg were driven back to <i>H</i>, and Knyphausen
to <i>J</i>, and surrounded they surrendered. Knyphausen endeavored to reach the bridge, having with him the
Lossberg cannon, which got stuck in the marsh at <i>K</i>, and the delay in extricating them was sufficient for Sullivan
to occupy the bridge and cut off Knyphausen's retreat. His own cannon were at <i>M</i>, and were not
used. Rahl's cannon were at <i>N</i>, and early dismounted. The Americans used cannon at <i>s s s</i>, etc. There is

Head of Elk.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> It is certain that Galloway threw
himself upon Howe's protection not far from the
time when Howe committed himself to a plan
of capturing Philadelphia. About the same time
it has been charged that General Lee, by a treasonable
project, aided Howe's purposes in the
same direction.</p>

<p class="pf400">The principal contemporary engraved maps of this part of the country were the 1770 edition of Scull's <i>Map
of Pennsylvania</i> (see Vol. V. p. 240), which was at this time included in the <i>American Atlas</i> (London, 1776),
and the <i>Atlas Amériquain</i> (Paris, 1777), and Pownall's edition, 1776, of Evans's <i>Map of the Middle Colonies</i>
(see Vol. V. p. 85), as well as Jefferys' edition, 1775, of the same, not so accurate. To these might be
added Montresor's <i>Province of New York and Pennsylvania, 1777</i>; Mellish and Tanner's <i>Seat of War in
America</i>; Faden's map of July 1, 1778, given in fac-simile in the <i>Penna. Mag. of Hist.</i>, i. 285; the maps in
the <i>Gentleman's Mag.</i>, 1776 and 1777; Almon's <i>Seat of War in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
1777</i>. A modern map, covering the same field to illustrate the campaign, is given in Theodore W. Bean's <i>Washington
at Valley Forge one hundred years ago</i>, and is repeated, with a few changes, in <i>Proceedings at the
Dedication of the Paoli Monument</i> (Westchester, 1877). The contemporary French maps are Du Chesnoy's
<i>Théâtre de la Guerre</i>, 1775-1778, Beaurain's <i>Carte pour servir à l'intelligence de la guerre</i> (Paris, 1777),
Brion de la Tour's <i>Théâtre de la Guerre</i> (Paris, 1777), with another by Phelippeaux "pour servir de suite",

<p>George H. Moore laid before the N. Y. Hist.
Soc., in June, 1859, the document in Lee's handwriting,
dated March 29, 1777, while he was a
prisoner in New York, in which he sketches a
plan for Howe's guidance in the coming campaign.
The "plan" in fac-simile, together with
an elucidation of it, was printed in Moore's
<i>Treason of Charles Lee</i>, New York, 1860. The
"plan" is also in <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, 1872, p.
361. Lee was at that time trying to induce Congress
to send commissioners to New York to
confer with him (Bancroft, ix. ch. 19), but Congress
was not ensnared. Moore contends (p. 84)
that the "plan" is responsible for Howe turning
towards Philadelphia, instead of going north
to help Burgoyne. Bancroft (ix. 333; also see
p. 211) asserts that it could have had no influence
on Howe's movements.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a></p>

<p>Lecky quotes Galloway's testimony, that of
the 66,000 men voted by Congress for this campaign,
hardly 16,000 were in the field. Bancroft
admits that no one better than Marshall (iii.
ch. 3) has described the part of Washington in
this campaign.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>At the opening of the campaign Washington
was kept long in suspense as to the purpose of
Howe. The eastern people feared his object
was Boston.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> Alexander Hamilton early in the
season had become Washington's aide, and his
letters at once begin to contain speculations on
Howe's purpose (<i>Works</i>, Lodge's ed., vii. 481,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
496, 500). On May 28th, Washington moved his
headquarters from Morristown<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> to Middlebrook,
and it was thought Howe would attempt to
march direct for Philadelphia. On June 12th,
Sullivan writes to Weare that Howe was to be
confronted the next day (<i>N. H. State Papers</i>,
viii. 584); and when it was known that Howe
was retiring towards New York, Washington,
June 23d, little credited a report, then prevalent,
that the British army was panic-struck (<i>Mass.
Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, vii. 138).<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> Cf., for all these
movements, Montresor's <i>Journal</i>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In July, when news came of the fall of Ticonderoga,
there were no signs that Howe was preparing
to coöperate with Burgoyne, and Hamilton
wondered (<i>Works</i>, vii. 507, 515). When
Howe sailed from New York, Washington was
in suspense.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> On July 31st, it was learned that
Howe's fleet was at the capes of Delaware, and
the next day the vessels had disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> It
was now supposed that Howe had gone to
Charleston, S. C., and that Washington might
safely reinforce the Northern army (<i>Hamilton's
Works</i>, vii. 517). Lafayette first took his seat
at a council of war called to consider the propriety
of this (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, v. 445).</p>

<p>In August, 1777, Gen. Sullivan conducted a
raid into Staten Island to seize Tories. He captured
some papers which implicated the Philadelphia
Quakers in inimical movements. (Cf.
<i>Journals of Congress</i>, ii. 246, 253.) In other respects
the incursion was unfortunate, and his
movements were examined by a court of inquiry,
which acquitted him.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>Howe had been six weeks at sea, with three
weeks' provisions, when he landed at the Head
of Elk.<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

<p>Upon Washington's march to confront Howe,
see, for the preliminary movements, William J.
Buck's paper on "Washington's Head Quarters
on the Neshaminy", in the <i>Penna. Mag. Hist.</i>, i.
275.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a></p>

<p>Upon the battle on the Brandywine the main
American source is the letters of Washington.
With Washington's aid, R. H. Harrison wrote
to Congress from Chad's Ford, Sept. 11th, at 5
<span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, a letter which was at once circulated in
broadside (Sabin, iii. p. 463; Hildeburn, no.
3,533). Pickering drafted for the commander-in-chief
the report (<i>Life of T. Pickering</i>, i. 157)
written at Chester, at midnight, September 11th
(Sparks, i. 251; v. 58; Dawson, i. 278). Hamilton
was on Washington's staff (J. C. Hamilton's
<i>Life of Hamilton</i>). C. C. Pinckney, also on the
staff, wrote a letter in 1820 (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, July,
1866, x. 202). Marshall, as a participant, drew
somewhat upon personal experience in his account
in the <i>Life of Washington</i>. Lafayette's
narrative, as given to Sparks, is in the <i>Sparks
MSS.</i> (no. xxxii. Cf. also Lafayette's <i>Mémoires</i>).
There is a journal of Capt. William Beatty, of
the Maryland line, in the <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, 2d. ser.,
i. 79. Sparks examines some of the disputed
points of the battle.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>There are contemporary records and opinions
in the <i>Penna. Archives</i>, 2d ser., x. 316; the letter
of the N. H. delegates in Congress in <i>N. H.
State Papers</i>, viii. 678; current reports in Moore's

<p>On the British side, we find Howe's report,
Oct. 10th, to Germain in Almon, v. 409; Dawson,
i. 281. Cf. the evidence before Parliament
in the <i>Conduct of the War</i> and the narrative
in Stedman.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

<p>The Hessian participancy is examined in Lowell's
<i>Hessians</i>, 197. Bancroft quotes Ewald's <i>Beyspiele
grosser Helden</i> as the testimony of an eye-witness
of Washington's well-conducted retreat.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a></p>

<p>The movements of the opposing armies toward
Philadelphia can be followed in the main
in the authorities cited for the battle. Some
local details are in Pennypacker's <i>Phœnixville</i>,
and an account of the damage done by the British
on the march is in Smith's <i>Delaware County</i>
(p. 544).</p>

<p>For the Paoli attack, we have Wayne's defence
at the court-martial in Dawson, i. 315,
and in the <i>One hundredth anniversary of the
Paoli massacre</i>, p. 52, which last contains also,
beside sundry contemporary records, the addresses
of J. S. Futhey (also in <i>Penna. Mag.
Hist.</i>, i. 285) and Wayne McVeagh. The report
of Howe to Germain is in Dawson, i. 317.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

<p>On Sept. 26th, Washington described the state
of the army, then at Potsgrove (<i>Mag. Amer.
Hist.</i>, Nov., 1884, p. 461). He was foiled by a
rain in an effort to hold the British once more
at bay, and Howe entered Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<p class="pf400">The following are the main portions
of Howe's despatch to Lord
George Germain, dated at Germantown,
Oct. 10, 1777: "The enemy
marched at six o'clock in the evening
of the third from their camp
near Skippach Creek, about sixteen
miles from Germantown. This village
forms one continued street for
two miles, which the line of the encampment,
in the position the army
then occupied, crossed at right angles,
near a mile from the head of
it, where the second battalion of
light infantry and the fortieth regiment
were posted. At three o'clock
in the morning of the fourth, the
patrols discovered the enemy's approach,
and the army was immediately
ordered under arms. Soon
after the break of day the enemy
began their attack upon the second
light infantry, which they sustained
for a considerable time, supported
by the fortieth regiment;
but at length being overpowered by
increasing numbers, the light infantry
and a part of the fortieth
retired into the village, when Lieutenant-Colonel
Mulgrave with six
companies of the latter corps threw
themselves into a large stone house
[Chew's], which, though surrounded
by a brigade, and attacked by four
pieces of cannon, he most gallantly
defended, until Major-General Grey,
at the head of three battalions of
the third brigade, turning his front
to the village, and Brigadier-General
Agnew, who covered Major-General
Grey's left with the fourth brigade,
by a vigorous attack repulsed the
enemy with great slaughter. The
fifth and fifty-fifth regiments from
the right, engaging them at the
same on the other side of the
village, completed the defeat of the
enemy in this quarter. The regiments
of Du Corps and Donop
being formed to support the left of
the fourth brigade and one battalion
of the Hessian grenadiers in the
rear of the Chasseurs, were not engaged.
The precipitate flight of the
enemy preventing the two first corps
from entering into action, and the
success of the Chasseurs in repelling
all efforts against them on that side,
did not call for the support of the
latter. The first light infantry and
the pickets of the line in front of
the right wing were engaged soon
after the attack began upon the
head of the village. The pickets
were obliged to fall back, but the
light infantry, being well supported
by the fourth regiment, sustained
the enemy's attack with such determined
bravery that they could
not make the least impression on
them.</p>

<p class="pf400">"Two columns of the enemy were
opposite to the guards, twenty-seventh
and twenty-eighth regiments,
who formed the right of the line.
Major-General Grant, who was upon
the right, moved up the forty-ninth
regiment about the time that Major-General
Grey had forced the enemy
in the village, and then advancing
with the right wing, the enemy's
left gave way, and was pursued
through a strong country between
four and five miles.</p>

<p class="pf400">"Lord Cornwallis, being early
apprised, at Philadelphia, of the enemy's
approach, put in motion the
two battalions of the British and
one of the Hessian grenadiers, with
a squadron of dragoons, and his
lordship getting to Germantown just
as the enemy had been forced out
of the village, he joined Major-General
Grey, when, placing himself
at the head of the troops, he followed
the enemy eight miles on the
Skippach road; but such was the
expedition with which they fled, he
was not able to overtake them. The
grenadiers from Philadelphia, who,
full of ardor, had run most of the
way to Germantown, could not arrive
in time to join in the action."</p>

ploughed the ground where he sat.</p>

<p class="pf400">The other plan is larger, and has been folded like a letter, and is addressed on the outside, "His Excellency General Washington, Headquarters." It shows only the west edge
of Mud Island, but marks particularly the distance, range, and armament of the attacking batteries, and is called, "Figuré aproximatif des ouvrages des assiégeans 14 9<sup>bre,</sup> 1777."
It marks the distance from the redoubt on the highland to Fort Mifflin as "1 mile 1-4 5 p." The wharf on the island is described as "où l'enemie déscendra, quoi que nous
l'ayons detruite."</p>

<p class="pf400">Other published maps of Mud Island (Fort Mifflin) are in Scharf and Westcott's <i>Philadelphia</i>, i. 363; Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 296; Wallace's <i>William Bradford</i>, p. 229.</p>

River at this time was one surveyed by Joshua Fisher, and published in London by Sayer and Bennett, 1775
and 1776. It was reproduced in <i>Penna. Archives</i>, 2d ser., vol. iii.; and maps based on them are in the <i>Gent.
Mag.</i>, July, 1779. There was a French edition issued in Paris by Le Rouge in 1777, which also made part of
the <i>Atlas Amériquain</i>. Other charts are in the <i>No. Amer. Pilot</i>, 1776, and in the <i>Neptune Américo-Septentrional</i>,
1778.</p>

<p class="pf400">There are plans for obstructing the river, in <i>Penna. Archives</i>, 2d ser., i. 749. Other maps of the river defences

<p>There were efforts to reorganize the army
during the winter. Congress had created a
board of war in November, 1777 (Pickering, i.
187; Lossing, ii. 867). On Jan. 10, 1778, a committee
of Congress was appointed to visit the
camp and concert plans for the reorganization
(<i>Journals</i>, ii. 401). A plan was drawn up by
conference, and later adopted by Congress
(Sparks, v. 525). Francis Dana wrote from the
camp, Feb. 12th, to Congress, and the draft,
found among the papers of Laurens, was printed
in the <i>Polit. Mag.</i> (vol. i.,&mdash;1780), by which it
was thought to appear that Howe could have
destroyed the American army if he had had enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a></p>

<p>A few days after the taking of Philadelphia,
the Rev. Jacob Duché, of that city, who had
been an approved supporter of the Americans,
transmitted a letter to Washington, tempting him
to desert the cause. Washington sent the letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
to Congress; but Sparks could not find it in the
Archives at Washington, and prints it from <i>Rivington's
Gazette</i> (<i>Corresp. of the Rev.</i>, i. 448). The
letters which grew out of this act, including one
of expostulation from Francis Hopkinson, the
brother-in-law of Duché, and that of repentance
sent to Washington by Duché in 1783, can be
found in Sparks, v. 94, 476.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

        <p class="pf400">A sketch made by combining two in the Sparks collection at Cornell University. One is a French plan,
from the Lafayette maps, which gives the main features of the topography to the present sketch. The other
is one transmitted by General Armstrong to Mr. Sparks in 1833, embodying the recollections of a Mr. William
Davis, "a remarkably active and intelligent man, who resided within the limits of the camp during its continuance
there." General Armstrong cites the testimony of a son of General Wayne, that the recollections of
Davis "of the most minute occurrences of the period were entirety unaffected by age." Upon this dependence
has been put for the positions of the troops and the quarters of the general officers. The plan given by
Sparks (<i>Washington</i>, v. 196) seems to have been made by a similar combination, though he omits the locations
of the general's quarters. The plan of Sparks is essentially followed in Guizot's <i>Washington</i>, in Lossing's
<i>Field-Book</i> (vol. ii. 334,&mdash;also see <i>Harper's Monthly</i>, xii. 307), and in Carrington's <i>Battles</i>, p. 402 (and

<p>During this time, Oct.-Dec., Washington was
kept informed of the British movements through
the letters of Maj. Clark (<i>Penna. Hist. Soc. Bull.</i>,
vol. i.). There was in November a project discussed
of taking Philadelphia by storm (Drake's
<i>Knox</i>, 136). Congress was urging the States to
renewed efforts (<i>N. H. State Papers</i>, viii. 728).
Early in December Howe had tried to allure
Washington to a battle near Chestnut Hill or
Whitemarsh (Sparks, v. 180; Dawson, i. ch. 31).
By the middle of December the American army
had gone into winter-quarters at Valley Forge
(Reed's <i>Reed</i>, i. 345), but not without having
thought at the same time of an attack on New
York (<i>Ibid.</i>, 344).</p>

from the main portion of a drawing preserved in the Penna. Hist. Society, which bears the following
indorsement: "The redoubts in the English lines are ten, beside two advanced ones. No. 1,
which I took a plan of in the month of July, was then compleat, but the excessive heat of the weather
and many avocations prevented our prosecuting the survey till October, by which time the wooden
work of the other redoubts, as well as the abaties, were carried away, which rendered it uncertain
how many platforms there were in each, but from what traces remained [I] believe I am right in nos.
2 &amp; ten: the other seven [eight] varied so little from no. 2, that the plan of that may serve for the
rest: I am equally uncertain whether the abatis ran in direct lines from redoubt to redoubt or formed
angles, but know that each part terminated at about 20 feet from the counter-scarps of contiguous
redoubts, these intervals being occasionally stopped up by chevaux-de-frize. All the 10 redoubts
were well faced both within and without with strong planks, but the advanced redoubts and other
small pieces were only faced with fascines. On the right of the line where small streams run through
swampy ground an inundation was formed by sloping the arches of the bridges, and making dams
were necessary, each furnished with a tumbling dam, well planked on the top and slopes of the main
dam, to carry off superfluous water.</p>

<p class="pf400">Enlarged plans and cross-sections of redoubts nos. 1, 2, and 10 are given in the margin, as well as of the western advanced redoubt, and other small
works, including the "Barriers across Kensington and Germantown roads with a cremaillered work between them cut out of the bank between the roads."

<p>Clinton, on relieving Howe from the command

city (Sparks, v. 548). This materially changed
the plans for the campaign, which had been determined
upon prior to the announcement of the
French alliance (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, xlv. and lviii.).

       <p class="pf400">From a plan in Hilliard d'Auberteuil's <i>Essais</i>, i. p. 270. <span class="smcap">Key</span>: The English had passed the night at <i>a</i>. Lee's advance showed itself at 3, when the British debouched from their
position at 1, while their guns at 2 fired on the Americans. The Americans at 3 retired into the wood, and joined Lee's main body, which debouched from the wood at 4, their
guns taking position at 6 and 7, while the British guns were at 5. The Americans (4, 8, and 10) retired and took position at 11; and while still further retreating, the British attacked
at 12, and the Americans made a stand at 13, and before all could retire still farther the British again attacked at 14. The Americans again formed at 15, when Washington, coming up
by way of the new Baptist meeting-house with the main body, formed at 16, Stirling and Greene in front, and Lafayette in the rear, while Lee's men at 15 passed to Washington's
rear, a British reconnoitring force appearing meanwhile at 17, and Plessis-Mauduit's battery, supported by 500 men, taking position at 18. The British at 14 and 17, being repulsed,
united at 19, whence they were further repulsed and took position at 20. They formed again at 21 after Washington's attack. They passed the night at 22.</p>

<p class="pf400">This map was apparently engraved from an original, followed in two plans, differently drawn, but in effect the same, which are among the maps in the Sparks collection at Cornell
University, and which were copied from Lafayette's own plan at Lagrange. It is called <i>Carte de l'affaire de Montmouth, où le général Washington commandait l'armée
Américaine et le général Clinton commandait l'armée Anglaise, le 28 Juin, 1778</i>. The "legende" shows references from 1 to 22, with extra ones <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, the latter (<i>b</i>) being at
the junction of the two dotted lines in the rear of 16, and is explained as the "movement of the second line, commanded by General Lafayette, which, as soon as the column at 17

<p class="pf400">There is also among the Sparks maps (Lafayette copies) a pen-and-ink sketch-plan,&mdash;differing somewhat, giving more detail,&mdash;made on the American side, and this more nearly
resembles the plan given by Sparks in his <i>Washington</i> (v. p. 430,&mdash;repeated in Duer's <i>Stirling</i>, ii. 196; and in Guizot's <i>Washington</i>. Cf. Irving's <i>Washington</i>, quarto ed.). The
plan in Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i> (ii. 356) is based on the one here engraved, and he also gives a view of the Freehold meeting-house (p. 359) and of the field (p. 362). Carrington (ch. 56)
gives an eclectic plan with more detail than any other.</p>

<p>The trial of Lee, and the papers produced by
it, furnish abundant contemporary evidence.
The trial was published at Philadelphia, 1778,

<p>Respecting the Conway Cabal, the best gathering
of the documentary evidence is in an appendix
to Sparks's <i>Washington</i>.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> Sparks's conclusion
is that the plot never developed into
"a clear and fixed purpose", and that no one
section of the country more than another specially
promoted it. Mahon (vi. 243) thinks that
Sparks glides over too gently the participation
of the New Englanders, who have been defended
from the charge of participation by
Austin in his <i>Life of Elbridge Gerry</i> (ch. 16).
Gordon implicates Samuel Adams, and J. C.
Hamilton is severe on the Adamses (<i>Repub.
U. S.</i>, i. ch. 13, 14). Mrs. Warren found no cause
to connect Sam. Adams with the plot, and Wells
(<i>Sam. Adams</i>, ii. ch. 46) naturally dismisses the
charge. It is not to be denied that among the
New England members of Congress there were
strong partisans of Gates, and the action of
Congress for good in military matters was impaired
by an unsettled estimate of the wisdom
of keeping Washington at the head of the army,
though it did not always manifest itself in assertion
(Greene's <i>Greene</i>, i. 287, 403, 411). Nothing
could be worse than John Adams's proposition
to have Congress annually elect the
generals (<i>Works</i>, i. 263); and he was not chary
of his disgust with what was called Washington's
Fabian policy. Sullivan, in one of his
oily, fussy letters to Washington (<i>Corresp. of
the Rev.</i>, ii. 366) finds expression of a purpose
to revive the plot in William Tudor's massacre
oration in Boston in March, 1779. The expressions
of Charles Lee, that "a certain great man
is most damnably deficient" (Moore's <i>Treason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
of Lee</i>, p. 68), like utterances of others, are
rather indicative of ordinary revulsions of feeling
under misfortunes than of a purpose of combination
among the disaffected. Gates's refusal
to reinforce Washington, and Hamilton's vain
efforts to persuade him, naturally fall among
the indicative signs;<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> and this apathy of Gates
very likely conduced immediately to the loss of
Fort Mifflin at the time it was abandoned (Wallace's
<i>Bradford</i>, App. 12). The attempt to gain
over Lafayette by the attractions of a command
in invading Canada, can be followed in Sparks's
<i>Washington</i>.<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a></p>

<p>Clinton, in Oct., 1780,<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> says it was

It has also been believed that the mutual recognition
was effected in some way through a
Lieutenant Hele, a British spy, who was in Philadelphia
after Arnold took command. There
might arise a suspicion that the understanding
was induced through the Tory family of Miss
Peggy Shippen, whom Arnold had married in
April, 1779. There are stories of her maintaining
correspondence with her British friends in
New York, but we do not know of any letters
remaining as proof of it, except one from André
to that lady after her marriage to Arnold, and
after the British correspondence with him under
feigned names had begun, in which letter the
gambolling Major André commiserated his fair
friend of the previous winter on the difficulty she
might experience in buying gewgaws in Philadelphia,
and offering to find them for her in New
York. Whether this language, like the commercial
phrases in which Arnold was at this
time conducting his correspondence under the
name of "Gustavus" with one "John Anderson",
a British merchant in that city, was likewise
a blind is not probably to be discovered,
and it might or might not involve a doubt as to
the privity of Peggy Arnold in the rather lagging
negotiations;<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> but the probability is that
André wrote the letter in his own name in order
that Arnold might, by the similarity of the handwriting,
identify his <i>pseudo</i> Anderson; for by
this time the nature of information which inured
to the advantage of the British, and which Gustavus
communicated to Anderson from time to
time, had pretty well convinced Clinton that the
person with whom he was dealing was high in
rank, and probably near headquarters in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Arnold had warm admirers; and
those who trusted him for certain brilliant merits
in the field included, among others, Washington
himself; but Congress did not confide in him
with so unquestioning a spirit. That body had
raised over him in rank several of his juniors,
much to Arnold's chagrin<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> and Washington's
annoyance; and it was only after a renewed exhibition
of his intrepidity at Danbury that it
had tardily raised him to a major-generalship.
Though his commission of May, 1777, gave him
equal rank, it made him still, by its later date,
the junior of those who had been his inferiors.<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a>
The Burgoyne campaign had been fought by
him under a consequent vexation of mind, and
his spirits chafed, not unreasonably, at the slight.
The wound he then received incapacitating him
for the field, had induced Washington, as has
been shown, to put him in command of Philadelphia
after the British evacuated it. It was
now observed that he more willingly consorted
with the Tory friends of his wife than with the
tried adherents of the cause. His arrogance
and impetuosity of manner always made him
enemies. The Council of Pennsylvania by a
resolution (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, Dec., 1870), as we have
seen, brought Congress to the point of ordering
a court-martial to decide upon the charges preferred
against the general, and to Arnold's revulsion
of feelings at this time has been traced,
by some, the beginning of his defection.<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> Certain
it is that he was kept in suspense too long
to render him better proof against insidious
thought, for it was not till December, 1779, that
the trial came on. Meanwhile his debts pressed,
his scrutinizers were vigilant, and there seems
some reason to believe that he sought to get relief
by selling himself to the French minister,&mdash;a
project which, if we may believe the account,
was repelled by that ambassador. To add to his
irritation, Congress did not find the accounts
which he had rendered of his expenditures in
the Canada expedition well vouched, and Arnold
resented their inquiries as an imputation upon
his honesty.<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a></p>

<p>The burden of a public reproof, no matter
how delicately imposed, was not calculated to
arrest the defection of man already too far
committed to retreat. If we may believe Marbois,
not the best of guides, there was found
among Arnold's papers, after his flight, a letter,
undated and unsigned, in which he was urged
to emulate the example of Gen. Monk, and save
his country by an opportune desertion of what
was no longer a prospering cause.<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> It soon
became evident to Arnold that of himself, destitute
of representative value, he was not a commodity
that Clinton was eager to buy. Accordingly
the recusant soldier sought to offer a better
bargain to the purchaser by the makeweight of
something that Clinton particularly longed for,
and this was the possession of the Hudson Valley
through its chief military posts.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> To get a
hold upon this, the time was opportune, for
there was a change to be made in its commander.
Arnold, however, did not get the
coveted prize without some intrigue, for
Washington, when he found that the
wounded soldier professed eagerness for
hotter work, proposed his taking the command
of one of the wings of the main army.
Arnold met the compliment by referring to
his wounds as precluding work in the saddle,
and induced Schuyler and R. R. Livingston
to importune Washington to assign
him to West Point.<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> The device succeeded,
and Arnold reached West Point, as its
commander, in the first week of August,
and established his headquarters in the
confiscated house which had belonged to
Beverley Robinson, and which was situated
on the east bank of the river, a little below
West Point.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> Clinton could have no longer
any doubt of the identity of his correspondent,
now that "Gustavus" wrote
from the Robinson house.</p>

<p>The conspirators' first effort was to establish
communications through Robinson,
on business ostensibly having relations to
this confiscated property; but Washington,
to whom, for appearances, Arnold showed
Robinson's application for an interview,
told him that the civil, and not the military,
powers should meet such proposals.
Arnold could find at this time little difficulty
in transmitting his clandestine letters, for
there was constant occasion for the passage of
flags from his own headquarters. To cover his
proceedings from the officers of the American
outposts, he only had to pretend that the expected
messages or messengers were from his
own spies in New York.<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a></p>

<p>Clinton was apparently
not willing to commit himself to any bargain,
unless Arnold would give a personal interview
as an evidence of his sincerity; while
Arnold, in according, on his part insisted that
his interviewer should be the convenient Anderson.
André, since he had become the adjutant-general
of the British army, was now fully understood
to represent that fictitious New York
merchant. Arnold named Robinson's house for
the meeting, and would make arrangements by
which any flag should pass the outposts. This
was objected to, and the neutral ground near
Dobbs Ferry was settled upon. Here Arnold
went in his barge; but the officers of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
guard-boats were not in the secret, and the
meeting failed by reason of their chasing Arnold's
barge up the river. Another attempt
was planned, but this failed in the beginning,
apparently by André's going up to the "Vulture",
sloop-of-war, which was lying in the river,
instead of landing lower down, as was expected.
André was provided with full instructions, which
if obeyed would have saved him the ignominy
of a felon's death. He was not to put off his
uniform, was not to go within the American
lines, and was not to receive any papers. His
bargain with Arnold was to have no written expression,
and it involved on Sir Henry's part
the dispatch of an ample force in a flotilla from
Sir George Rodney's fleet, then in New York,
where the men were already embarked, ostensibly
for the Chesapeake, and the attack was
to be made on the 25th of September, when it
was supposed that Washington would have left
the Hudson to go to Connecticut for an interview
with Rochambeau. There was further to
be made by André a promise that Arnold should
have a commission in the British army and a
sum of money. The American general, on his
part, was so to dispose the forces in the works
about West Point that the attack would, beyond
doubt, end in a surprise and a mastery
that would give color to the necessity of a surrender,
which he was promptly to make.</p>

by Hopwood for J. H. Smith's <i>Authentic Narrative</i>, London, 1808, and from this second engraving the present
cut is taken. It has of late years been engraved by H. B. Hall in Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, quarto ed., vol.

at Tunbridge Wells. A pen-and-ink sketch by himself, made during his confinement, is now preserved
in the Trumbull gallery at New Haven. Sparks first engraved it, and it has since been reproduced by Lossing,
in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, xxi. 4, in Smith's <i>Andreana</i>, and elsewhere.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It now became necessary that some device
should be practised to let Arnold know that
André had reached the "Vulture." There had
just happened some firing upon a boat of the
"Vulture", in going to meet what the British
captain supposed or pretended to suppose a
white flag displayed on the shore. This gave
the opportunity of dispatching a flag to the commander
in the Highlands, to remonstrate against
such perfidy. The British captain accordingly
sent such a message, and André wrote the letter
in a hand which he knew Arnold would recognize,
and moreover countersigned it with "John
Anderson, Secretary."</p>

<p>Arnold at once bent to the occasion. He
engaged one Joshua Hett Smith, who lived in
the neighborhood, to go by night to the "Vulture"
in a boat, and bring to the adjacent
shore a gentleman whom he would find on
board, from whom Arnold expected to get information.
How far Smith was a dupe or a knave
has never been satisfactorily determined. The
business would seem to have had a plain significance
to a quick-witted man; but a court was
not able later to convict Smith of knowing precisely
what it all meant. Smith had also with
him two oarsmen, and it was not apparently believed
that they were in a position to know
enough to render their patriotism doubtful. It
was then by night, in a boat steered by Smith,
that André, dressed in his uniform, but with an
overcoat wrapped about him, was rowed ashore.
According to Smith, the darkness and the outer
garment so concealed Andre's dress that his
steersman never suspected him to be an officer.
Arnold was found waiting in the bushes, a little remote
from the landing. Here Smith left the two
conspirators alone and returned to his boat; but
when the signs of dawn began to appear he returned
to warn them. Arnold, who had brought
along with him an extra horse, mounted André
on it, and the two started to go to Smith's house,<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>
which was two or three miles away on the hill,
and within the American lines.</p>

<p>If André is to
be believed, he was not told that he was to go
within the American outposts, and indeed there
is no conclusive evidence to show why they went
to Smith's house at all. Perhaps Smith or the
boatmen refused, in the growing light, to take the
risk of the return to the vessel. The general
opinion has been that the conspirators had not
concluded their negotiations, and needed more
time. That Arnold had had a predetermined
purpose to go to the house, if necessary, seems
to be made clear from the fact that he had induced
Smith to move his family away from their
home temporarily, and on some pretext which
Smith did not object to. André says that he
first discovered Arnold's plan to get him within
the American lines when, as they rode on their
way, Arnold gave the countersign at the outposts.
This was the first departure from Clinton's
instructions. After they had reached the
house the day broadened, and, the sound of cannon
being heard, André went to a window,
whence he could see the "Vulture" in the distance,<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a>
and saw that the Americans had dragged
some cannon to a neighboring point, whence
their fire became so annoying that the vessel
raised her anchor and fell down the river. André
became anxious lest this incident should preclude
his return by water. The day had not far
advanced when the bargain was completed, and
Arnold prepared to leave for West Point to perfect
the dispositions expected of him. He left
behind sundry papers, mostly in his own handwriting,
which André was to take to Clinton.
Why another injunction of his superior was
evaded by André in accepting the papers is not
clear. They conveyed no information about the
condition of the post which Clinton did not already
possess or André could repeat to him.
Possibly it was thought that, being in Arnold's
autograph, the documents might serve as a
pledge for what André was verbally to report to
him.</p>

<p>Arnold seems to have made no certain provision
for his fellow-conspirator's return to the
"Vulture", but he left passes, which could be
used either on the water or land passage, as circumstance
might determine. André spent an
anxious day after Arnold left. He was finally
cheered by observing that the "Vulture", as if
mindful of him, had returned to her previous
moorings; but his hopes were futile. As night
came on Smith showed no signs of arranging for
a water passage to the ship, and made excuses.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The fact probably was, that, after the cannonading
of the morning, Smith had no desire
to risk himself on the river in a boat.
It was accordingly agreed that André should
undertake to return to New York by land,
and that Smith should accompany him beyond
the American outposts, under the protection
of Arnold's pass and of his own
acquaintance with the officers of the lower
posts. It now became necessary for André
to disregard another of Clinton's directions,
and exchange his uniform for common
clothes.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> This done, he put the papers
which Arnold had given him under his soles
and within his stockings. Thus arrayed,
about dusk the two started, accompanied
by Smith's negro servant. They crossed
King's Ferry, and proceeding on their way
were stopped once, but suffered to advance
on showing Arnold's pass. After spending
the night at a house, they had gone on some
distance the next morning when Smith
parted with André, and, going to Robinson's
house, reported to Arnold that André
had been conducted beyond the lines. André
went on in better spirits than before, feeling
sure now that he could encounter nothing
more serious than some wandering cowboys,
as the British marauders who infested the
Neutral Ground between the two armies
were called, and with whom he could easily
parley to their satisfaction. The natural
foes of the "Cowboys" were the "Skinners",
who harried the unfortunate adherents
of the British along the same roads, and
wrestled with the Cowboys as opportunity
offered.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> As it happened, a party of the
American prowlers were out to intercept
some British marauders, and three of the
number were ensconced close by a stream
not far from Tarrytown, on the upper side.
They were by name John Paulding, David
Williams, and Isaac Van Wart. Paulding
was by force of character the leader, and
was dressed in a refugee's suit, which not
many days before had been put upon him
in exchange for his own better garments,
when he had come out from confinement within
the British lines. This suit, as well as Paulding's
profession that he was "of the lower party",
given to André's inquiry when, as he came
along, he was stopped by the men, led to
André's revealing himself as a British officer.
When the traveller found he had made a mistake,
he showed Arnold's pass, and tried to enforce
it by threats of the American commander's
displeasure if the captors dared to disregard it.
This failing, he tried bribes, and it was André's
opinion that if he could have made the payment
sure he might have got off, as money seemed to
be their object. The men, on the other hand,
said that they could have resisted any offer of
money when, on searching their prisoner, they
found the papers in his boots.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> Paulding, who
alone could read, saw the purport of the documents,
and pronounced André a spy.</p>

</div></div>

<p>André was remounted and led under their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
combined guidance to the quarters<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> of Colonel
Jameson, who commanded some dragoons at
Northcastle. That officer recognized Arnold's
handwriting in the papers found on the prisoner,
but he seems to have been bewildered by the
discovery, though it was afterwards urged that
he thought the transaction was a plot of "John
Anderson", whoever he might be, to implicate
Arnold in some mischief. How far the prisoner
himself may have prompted Jameson is not
known, for it was clear enough to André that
Arnold only could now extricate him from the
gathering toils. Accordingly, events took a
promising turn for him when Jameson dispatched
the prisoner, under escort, to Arnold's
headquarters, with a letter which informed his
superior of what was apparent enough, that
some dangerous papers had been found on Anderson,
and that he had sent them to Washington.
Major Benjamin Tallmadge, one of his
officers, who was absent on a scout, returned before
André had long been gone, and learning the
particulars from Jameson saw at once the blunder,
and persuaded Jameson to send a messenger
to recall André and his escort. Jameson did so,
but insisted that the letter to Arnold should go
on, as it did.</p>

<p>The messenger with the papers sought to intercept
Washington on the lower road from
Hartford, which the commander-in-chief was
supposed at that time to be traversing on his
return from the interview with Rochambeau.</p>

<p>The next morning André was sent, for better
security, in the charge of Tallmadge to Colonel
Sheldon's quarters at New Salem. Here, getting
permission to walk in the door-yard in the
custody of an officer named King, André revealed
his name and station, and being allowed pen and
paper, he made the same avowal in a letter to
Washington, which, when written, he handed to
Tallmadge. Its contents confirmed that officer's
suspicion that the prisoner was a military
man, for he had shown a soldier's habit of turning
on his heel as he paced his room.</p>

<p>Washington, returning by the upper road, had
missed Jameson's messenger, who, retracing his
steps, passed through New Salem, where he
was entrusted also with the letter which André
had just written, and then went on towards the
Robinson house, where Washington was then
supposed to be.</p>

<p>It was now the 25th, the very day when Rodney
was to come up the river with his flotilla,
and Arnold sat at breakfast at this same Robinson
house,<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> not knowing what the day would
develop. There were with him Mrs. Arnold,
who had not long before (Sept. 15) come from
Philadelphia, and two of Washington's aides, who
had arrived a little in advance of their chief.</p>

<p>It was two days earlier than Washington had
been expected back, and this was a serious perplexity
in the mind of the conspirator. The suspense
was soon ended, for Jameson's messenger
to him shortly arrived, and the letter was put in
Arnold's hands before the company. He read it,
showed, as was remembered afterwards, a little
agitation, but only a little, and in a few minutes
left the table, saying that it was necessary for
him to go to West Point. It seemed natural
enough to his guests; but Mrs. Arnold observed
his agitation more keenly, and followed him to
their chamber, where all was revealed to her.
She swooned; he kissed the infant lying there;
descended the stairs;<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> stopped an instant to say
to the breakfast party that Mrs. Arnold was not
feeling well and would not come down again;
mounted a horse which he had already ordered;
hurried down the steep road to the river; entered
his barge and seated himself in its prow;
directed his men to row to mid-stream; and then
priming his pistols, which he had taken from his
holster, he ordered them to hurry down the
river, as he had to go with a flag to the "Vulture",
and must hasten back to meet Washington,
who was shortly to reach his quarters. He
tied a white handkerchief to a cane, and waved
it as he passed Livingston's batteries at Verplanck's
Point, and that officer recognizing the
barge allowed it to pass on. In a few minutes
more he was under the "Vulture's" guns, and
then under her flag. His boatmen resisted his
offers of recompense for desertion, and were not
allowed to return to shore to spread the intelligence,
which they now comprehended.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a></p>

<p>Not long after Arnold left the Robinson house,
Washington arrived, and, learning that Arnold
had gone to West Point, he passed over unsuspicious
to that post, where he was surprised not
to find Arnold.<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> While Washington was gone,
Jameson's messenger with the captured papers
and André's letter arrived, and Hamilton, left
behind by Washington, opened them as his confidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
aide.<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> As soon as Washington's boat
approached on his return from West Point,
Hamilton went towards the dock to meet his
chief, whispered a word, and both later entered
the house and were closeted. The plot was revealed.
Hamilton was dispatched to Livingston
to head off Arnold in his escape if possible, but
on reaching that officer's post it was found that
Arnold's boat had already passed. Before Hamilton
was ready to set out on his return, a flag
from the "Vulture" brought ashore a letter
from Arnold, addressed to Washington, framed
in lofty expressions of his own rectitude, and
avowing the innocence of Smith, of his own
wife, and his aides.<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> Before Hamilton's return,
Washington had dined with his officers without
revealing the secret, but he shortly took Knox
and Lafayette into his confidence. There was
naturally great uncertainty as respects the extent
of the conspiracy, and of what preparations the
enemy had made for an immediate onset. The
anxiety of the moment was soon evinced by the
great activity of aides and orderlies. Word was
sent in every direction for arrangements to be
made for any emergency.<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a></p>

<p>André was brought to West Point, and Smith
was arrested and held for examination. Special
precautions were taken to keep them apart and
to prevent escape. André was then conveyed
down the river, still under Tallmadge's care, to
headquarters at Tappan, where he was closely
guarded in an old stone house, still standing.<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a></p>

<p>A board of general officers was at once summoned
to consider the case and recommend
what action should be taken. The papers taken
from André were laid before them.<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> André himself
was brought into their presence, when he
made a written statement, and answered questions.
He acknowledged everything, but said
nothing to implicate others. He affirmed that
he did not consider himself under the protection
of a flag when he landed from the "Vulture."
The report of the board was that André was a
spy, and merited the death of a spy. Washington
ordered the execution, and sent a record of
the proceedings to Congress and recommended
its publication. Congress printed the record.<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a></p>

<p>Clinton was meanwhile informed of what had
happened by the return of the "Vulture" to
New York, and wrote to Washington that Arnold's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
flag and pass should save André from
the character of a spy. Beverley Robinson wrote
to a similar purport, and so did Arnold; but
the latter added a threat of retaliation in case
André was executed, which was not calculated
to further the purpose of André's friends, and
it is rather surprising they allowed the letter to
proceed. Washington replied in effect that a
flag must be used in good faith to preserve its
character, and that the concealment of dress
and papers was the action of a spy.</p>

<p>Gen. Robertson was sent by Clinton to make
further representations, and Washington put off
the execution till Greene could confer with that
general at an outpost. A repetition of the arguments
on the British side made no change in
the aspects of the case; and when Robertson
quoted Arnold as saying André was under a
flag, Greene told him they believed André rather
than Arnold. Robertson wrote again to Washington,
who had now definitely fixed mid-day of
Oct. 2d for the execution. Washington thought
it also best to leave unanswered a note of André
requesting to be shot rather than hanged. Further
letters, amplifying the British arguments,
were prepared,<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> but before they could be sent
to Washington word came that the execution
had taken place.</p>

<p>During his confinement in Tappan, and after
he became aware of his fate, André conducted
himself with a cheerful dignity that much endeared
him to the gentlemen who came in contact
with him. His servant had brought from
New York fresh linen and his uniform, which
André put on with evident satisfaction. He
practised his ready skill in pen-and-ink drawing,
and made several sketches, which he gave
to his attendants as souvenirs.<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> As his hour
approached, he said graciously to his escort,
"I am ready", and went to the place appointed,
surrounded by guards and through a large concourse
of people. Of the general officers of the
army at the post only the commander-in-chief
and staff were absent; and as the sad procession
passed headquarters the blinds were drawn, and
no one was seen. When the gibbet came in
sight, André shrank a moment, but instantly recovered,
for he had nourished hopes that his
request as to the manner of his death would not
be denied. He bandaged his eyes himself;
lifted the cloth a moment to say that he wished
all to bear witness to the firmness with which
he met his death; and when the cart was withdrawn
died instantly.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> When his uniform was
removed and placed in his servant's hands, the
coffin which contained the body was buried near
the spot.</p>

<p>His remains were disinterred in 1821 and
taken to England,<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> where they were deposited
in Westminster Abbey, beside the monument

<p>The report of the court respecting André,
with its appendix (already referred to), and the
trial of Smith were the first public sifting of the

turned over to the civil authorities for a further

Marbois, the secretary of the French legation at
Philadelphia at the time, wrote a <i>Complot d'Arnold
et Clinton</i>, which was not published till
1816 at Paris. Sparks says, that what came under
Marbois' personal observation is valuable;
but otherwise the book, as most students think,
should be used with caution.<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest comprehensive treatment of the
subject&mdash;and it has hardly been surpassed
since&mdash;was in Sparks's <i>Life and Treason of
Arnold</i> (Boston), and he gives the principal documentary
evidence in his <i>Washington</i>, vol. vii.
App.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a></p>

<p>The next special examination of the conspiracy
was made in Winthrop Sargent's<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> <i>Life and Career

<p>In 1864 the story necessarily made a part of
Edward C. Boynton's <i>History of West Point</i>,
who pointed out the military advantage of the
Highlands of the Hudson.<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> Not long after this,
Henry B. Dawson, then editing the <i>Yonkers
Gazette</i>, printed in its columns sixty-eight contemporary
documents or narratives, and these,
subsequently printed from the same type in
book-form, constitute no. 1 of Dawson's <i>Gazette
Series</i>, under the title of <i>Papers concerning the
capture and detention of Major John André</i>
(1866). It is the most complete gathering of
authentic material which has been made.</p>

<p>The volume (x.) of Bancroft which contains
his account of the conspiracy appeared in 1875,
and was constructed "by following only contemporary
documents, which are abundant and
of the surest character, and which, taken collectively,
solve every question.... The reminiscences
of men who wrote in later days are so
mixed up with errors of memory and fable that
they offer no sure foothold."<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of the culmination and collapse of
the conspiracy is easily told with the abundant
testimony of those who were observers and actors,&mdash;much
of the record being made at the
time, though some of it, put upon paper at varying
intervals later, may need to be scrutinized
closely, particularly as regards André's demeanor
from the moment of his arrest to his execution.<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>For the English side we must mainly depend
on the letters and statements of Clinton, which
are elaborate, and may well be supplemented by
contemporary and later English historians.<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a></p>

<p>As respects the justice of André's execution,
the military authorities were disagreed on the
two sides at the time, and for a while the alleged
offence of Washington was considered in England
a conspicuous blot upon his character; but
Lord Mahon has been the only prominent instance
of continued belief in this view among
English writers, who have generally conceded
the right of the Americans to count André a
spy, however they might wish that Washington
had been more clement. The attractive manners
and brilliant mental habit of André have
blinded even American writers to the atrocious
nature of his mission, and to the sinister purpose
which a man of sensibility and elevated
character should never have grasped, even amid
the license which a state of war gives. The
power to face death with a calm and graceful
courage may indeed be mated with the moral
lightness that belongs to an intellectual popinjay
and a debased intriguer.<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></p>

<p class="pc1 mid">THE WAR IN THE SOUTHERN DEPARTMENT.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY EDWARD CHANNING,</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>Instructor in History in Harvard College</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN the autumn of 1778 the British commander-in-chief, Sir Henry Clinton,
determined to attempt for the second time the subjugation of the
Southern colonies, and Savannah was selected as the first point of attack.
On November 27, 1778, Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell, with thirty-five
hundred men of all arms, sailed from Sandy Hook, and anchored off
Tybee Entrance December 23d. Meantime a deserter from an advance
transport had given the Americans warning. Their commander was General
Robert Howe, a good but unsuccessful officer, who had not been fortunate
in securing the confidence of the authorities of Georgia. Ascertaining
these facts, Campbell pressed on without awaiting the arrival of
Brigadier-General Augustine Prevost with a reinforcement from Florida.
On the 28th, late in the afternoon, the British fleet assembled in the Savannah
River, off Giradeau's house on Brewton Hill, which is about two miles
from Savannah in a straight line, though double that distance by road. A
causeway, nearly half a mile in length, ran from the river to the bluff through
a rice-field which in ordinary times could have been flooded, but over which
the bluff was now accessible from all points.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 29th the Highlanders carried the position with
trifling loss, when Campbell, advancing toward Savannah, found the Americans
most advantageously posted across the highroad. Through no fault
of Howe, his rear was attained, while he awaited an attack in front. The
Americans suffered a severe loss, and only a small part of them succeeded
in joining Lincoln beyond the Savannah River. Campbell pushed up the
Savannah, and in ten days the frontier of Georgia was secured, and this was
the condition when Prevost arrived and took command.</p>

<p>Although Lincoln had arrived at Charleston on December 6th, he was
not able to reach Purisburgh before the 5th of January, 1779. His army,
composed almost entirely of militia, refused under him, as it had under
Howe, to be governed by the Continental rules of war.<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>At first it seemed to the enemy that the occupation of Georgia could be
easily maintained, but the neighboring militia rallied under Pickens, and
drove the British back. The American success, however, was brief, for
Colonel Prevost, a brother of the general, turned upon General Ashe, who
with a detachment from Lincoln's army was following the British retreat.
The Americans were surprised and suffered a defeat, which cost Lincoln
one third of his army and restored to Prevost his superiority in Georgia.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a></p>

<p>The scale again turned. Lincoln, reinforced, once more severed the
British communications with the up-country Tories, when Prevost, to disconcert
his adversary, at first sought to get between him and Charleston,
and then suddenly advanced on the city itself. Here Moultrie, who had
been watching the British advance, threw up some defences. Negotiations
for a surrender followed, and Governor Rutledge, who was in the town,
even proposed a scheme of neutrality for the State during the war, to which
Prevost would not listen. The British now intercepted a messenger from
Lincoln, and finding that general closing in upon him, Prevost suddenly
decamped and marched toward Savannah.</p>

<p>The summer was uneventful; but in the early autumn D'Estaing, who
after leaving Newport had been cruising with some success in the West
Indies, now turned northerly, and on September 3 (1779) his advance ships
arrived off the mouth of the Savannah River. A landing, however, was
not effected until the 12th, when the troops landed at Beaulieu, on Ossabaw
Sound, fourteen to sixteen miles from Savannah. They did not reach that
town until the 16th, so that Prevost had time to call in his scattered detachments,
and all but those from Beaufort had arrived when, on the evening
of that day, D'Estaing, in the name of the king of France, summoned him
to surrender. A correspondence followed, which was prolonged till the
defences were strengthened and Maitland got up from Beaufort with eight
hundred men, when Prevost refused to surrender.</p>

<p>D'Estaing had been all the more willing to grant the truce as Lincoln,
who was looked for from Charleston, had not arrived on the 16th. By the
23d a considerable part of the Americans had joined the French, and siege
operations were begun. Guns were brought up from the French ships and
trenches pushed to within three hundred yards of the besieged lines. On
September 24th a sortie was made by the garrison for the purpose of
developing the strength of the besiegers. The sortie was repulsed with
ease, but the French, following the assailants back to their lines, were exposed
to a murderous fire, and incurred a heavy loss in killed and wounded.
The bombardment was then begun with vigor, but with little effect. At
last, on October 8th, D'Estaing declared that he could not keep his vessels
longer exposed to the Atlantic gales. An assault was determined on. In
the night the sergeant-major of one of the Charleston militia regiments
deserted to the enemy and gave full information of the intended movement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
and further declared that the attack on the British left would be only a feint,
the real attack being directed against the Spring Hill redoubt, on the
right.<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a></p>

<p>The assault took place, and failed as much by a lack of coöperation
between the columns as by the treachery. This disaster so dispirited the
allies that Lincoln crossed the river on the 19th, and when he was safe
on the other side the French withdrew to their ships and sailed away,&mdash;their
last frigate leaving the river on the 2d of November.</p>

<p>The sailing of the French left the coast again exposed, and Clinton,
coming from New York, now prepared to attack Charleston. On the 11th
of February, 1780, a landing was made on Simmons' Island, just to the
north of the North Edisto River. Thence by John's Island, Stono Ferry,
Wappoo Cut and River, the Ashley was reached, and a lodgment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
effected on the neck of land at the seaward end of which Charleston
stands. Clinton advanced with caution. On the 1st of April the first
parallel was opened about eight hundred yards from the American works.</p>

<p>On the 21st of March the British fleet, commanded by Admiral Mariot
Arbuthnot in person, had crossed the bar unopposed. Some time was
spent in taking on board their provisions and guns. Then on the afternoon
of the 7th, 8th, or 9th of April&mdash;for there is a hopeless confusion
as to the exact date&mdash;in the midst of a furious thunder-shower the fleet
ran by Fort Moultrie without material damage, except to the store-ship
"Eolus", which was abandoned. The greater portion of the garrison of
Moultrie, commanded by Colonel C. C. Pinckney, was then withdrawn,&mdash;the
feeble remnant surrendering on the 6th of May, with scarcely a show
of resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 8th of April guns were mounted in battery in the first British
parallel. On the 11th, Lincoln having refused to surrender, fire was
opened. The second parallel was completed on the 19th, bringing the
British to within four hundred and fifty yards of the opposing line.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th Tarleton and Ferguson, by a sudden push,
dispersed the force at Monk's Corner, which had guarded Lincoln's
supplies. On the 18th a reinforcement of three thousand men arrived
from New York, and enabled Clinton to complete the investment of the
town, the command on the eastern side of the Cooper being given to
Cornwallis. There was during the next few days a sortie, some desultory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
fighting, and an unsuccessful correspondence for a surrender. On May
8th the third parallel was completed, bringing the besiegers to within forty
yards of the works, while the canal in front of the lines was partly drained
and the batteries were ready to open fire. Clinton again summoned the
garrison, but again Lincoln declined to surrender,&mdash;this time because
Clinton refused to regard the citizens as anything but prisoners on parole.
On the 11th the British reached the ditch and advanced to within twenty-five
yards of the works.
Resistance was no longer
to be thought of,
especially as the citizens
themselves now
petitioned to have the
terms offered by Clinton
accepted. The articles
were accordingly drawn
up and signed on the
12th, and the English
took possession.</p>

<p>On that day the Continentals
to the number
of perhaps fifteen hundred&mdash;there
were about
five hundred in the hospital
at the time&mdash;marched
out, with colors
cased and drums
beating the "Turk's
March", and laid down
their arms. By regarding
every adult capable
of bearing arms as a
militiaman, Clinton reckoned his prisoners at five thousand. Lincoln has
been severely censured for this defence, but if the Carolinians had rallied
as expected, he might have held out until the heats of the summer and the
arrival of De Ternay would have compelled Clinton's retirement.</p>

<p>Clinton now sent out three expeditions to the up-country, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
important of which was destined to secure the region north of the Santee
and Wateree.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> Cornwallis, commanding this expedition, detached Tarleton
against Buford, who had with him the remnants of the American cavalry
and some Continentals from Virginia. Tarleton overtook him at
Waxhaw Creek on the 29th of May. Of the five hundred Americans who
entered the fight, one hundred and thirteen were killed, while one hundred
and fifty were wounded. The slaughter was vindictive, and "Tarleton's
Quarters" will never be forgotten in the upper regions of South Carolina.</p>

<p>Clinton and Arbuthnot, judging their conquest of the province permanent,
now proclaimed as rebels all who refused the oath of allegiance, and

<p>The new commander's
proclamations, following upon
those of Clinton and Arbuthnot,
were enough at variance
with them to create discontent
among those inclined toward
the British side. The
spirits of the patriots began
to revive, especially in the
back regions, where Colonels
Locke and Williams and Generals
Rutherford and Sumter
gathered strong bands around
their standards. The fights at
Ramsour Mills, Rocky Mount,
Hanging Rock, and Musgrove
Mills, which these partisans
conducted, were in the main
successful, but all were lost
to sight in the great disaster
which soon overtook the
American arms near Camden.</p>

<p>Early in the spring of 1780, it had been decided to send a reinforcement
under De Kalb to Lincoln, at Charleston. With about fourteen hundred
men of the Maryland and Delaware lines, that general left Morristown
on the 16th of April, 1780, and on the 1st of June, in Petersburg, he learned
of the fall of Charleston. He decided to push on with the utmost speed,
in the hope that his coming might still save the interior of the State. But
delay after delay occurred, and De Kalb did not reach the Deep River<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
before the 6th of July, when he found nothing prepared for his reception;
and what was still more inexcusable, the North Carolina militia, under
Caswell, were holding aloof. On the 25th a new commander of the
Southern armies arrived in Horatio Gates, the popular hero of Saratoga.
His appointment had been made by Congress against the wishes of Washington,
but in obedience to a general popular consent. De Kalb received
Gates with genuine pleasure, and took his place at the head of the regulars,
then forming the whole army.</p>

<p>Against the advice of his ablest officer, Otho H. Williams, Gates determined
to join the North Carolinians in their camp near Lynch's Creek,
since they would not join him, and with them he hoped to seize Camden.
Two days after his arrival, on July 27th, the march began, and after the
most acute suffering from hunger the regulars joined the militia. So lax
was the discipline among Caswell's men, that Williams and a party of officers
rode through their lines and camp without being once challenged. Approaching
the general's tent, they were informed that it was an unseasonable
hour for gentlemen to call. Yet Caswell was within striking distance
of a disciplined army, commanded by an enterprising general, Lord Rawdon.
Marching a little farther, the British were found in a strong position
on the southern bank of Little Lynch's Creek.</p>

</div></div>

<p>By a march up the creek, Gates might have placed his superior force
on Rawdon's flank and rear. This
was what Rawdon feared, and what
De Kalb is said to have advised.
Instead he passed two days in idleness,
and then, inclining to the
right, marched to Clermont or
Rugeley's Mill, on the road from
Charlotte to Camden, and not more
than thirteen miles from the latter.
There, seven hundred militia from
Virginia joined him. From that
place, too, he sent four hundred
men, including some regulars, to
assist Sumter in a contemplated
attack on the enemy's communications.
It was now determined to
seek a more defensible position on
the banks of a creek seven miles
nearer Camden. This position
could be turned only by marching
a considerable distance either up or down the creek. Exactly what Gates
had in view by this movement can not now be ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a></p>

<p>Cornwallis arrived at the front on the morning of August 14th, and decided
to surprise Gates; but the two armies started on respective marches
at precisely the same hour, ten o'clock of the evening of August 15, 1780.
Their advanced guards met at about half past two the next morning.
Armand, a French adventurer, with his "legion" forming the American
van, retired panic-stricken, and the two armies deployed across the road.
The position in which the opposing generals now found themselves was
singularly favorable to the smaller numbers of the British, as the front was
necessarily very short, owing to a marsh which protected while limiting
either flank. This advantage Cornwallis was not slow to perceive. A hurried
council was held on the American side, and it was decided that there
was no alternative but to fight. At dawn the enemy was observed getting
into position on the extreme left. Stevens, with the Virginia militia,
already in line, was ordered to charge before the enemy's formation was
complete. It so happened that Cornwallis, thinking the Virginians were
making some change in their dispositions, ordered his right forward. Led
by the gallant Webster, the British came on with such a rush that the men
of Virginia threw down their loaded guns with bayonets set, broke and dispersed
to the rear. Nor did the North Carolinians do better. Seeing the
Virginians break, they did not await the onset, but threw away their arms
and fled. One regiment indeed, inspired by the example of the regulars,
fired several rounds before it broke. Deserted by those whom they had
marched so many weary miles to succor, the men of Maryland and Delaware
fought till to fight longer was criminal. Then the under-officers, on
their own responsibility, brought off all they could, for their commander,
De Kalb, overwhelmed by eleven wounds, had fallen into the hands of the
enemy,&mdash;"a fate", says Williams, "which probably was avoided by other
generals only by an opportune retreat." That night Gates found himself
at Charlotte, sixty miles from the scene of conflict. Caswell was with him,
and they were soon joined by Smallwood and Gist. In fact, excepting
the one order issued to the Virginians at the outset, the leaders seem to
have left the conduct of the fight to De Kalb and the subordinate officers.
From Charlotte Gates retired to Hillsborough, where the legislature was
then sitting.</p>

<p>Cornwallis seems to have been satisfied with the havoc wrought on the
field of battle, for he pursued without vigor, and soon returned to Camden
and gave his attention to Sumter. That enterprising but negligent chieftain
had captured the redoubt at the ferry over the Wateree, and had
ensnared a convoy destined for Cornwallis. On the night of the 17th,
hearing of Gates's overthrow, Sumter left his camp, and moved with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
celerity that a corps which Cornwallis sent against him failed to strike
him. Shortly after, Tarleton found him less vigilant, and came upon him
so unexpectedly that resistance was hardly attempted, and Sumter escaped
with scarcely half his force.</p>

<p>Gates has been severely blamed for this defeat; too severely, it seems to
me. The march of the regulars from Buffalo Ford to Lynch's Creek was
undoubtedly full of hardship, but it was well planned and executed. Nor
do the troops who made it seem to have been demoralized by it. On the
contrary, seldom have men fought more gallantly than De Kalb's division
fought on the morning of August 16, 1780. The Virginians, whose flight
made defeat probable, followed the Continentals in the march across the
"desert", and did not suffer nearly as much as the leading division. The
North Carolina militia, whose panic turned a probable defeat into a rout,
had no part whatever in that painful march. The disaster was due to the
over-confidence which Gates felt in his men. Had the militia stood firm,
the event of the campaign might have been different. There was no defect
in Gates as a strategist or tactician. He had a larger number of men in
line than his opponent. His dispositions were as perfect as the time and
place permitted. The defeat Was "brought on", to use the emphatic
words of Stevens, the gallant leader of the Virginians, "by the damned
cowardly behavior of the militia."</p>

<p>From Camden Cornwallis advanced to Charlotte, overcoming all obstacles
which the militia under Davie interposed. Other militia, meanwhile,
under Clarke, advanced on Augusta, but British reinforcements from
Ninety-Six, under Cruger, forced Clarke to abandon the attack, and, burdened
with the families of some leading Whigs, he retired towards the
mountains. Cornwallis, hearing of this, ordered Ferguson, who had been
beating up recruits in the upper country, to endeavor to cut Clarke off.
Now it happened that at this very time the sturdy frontiersmen, under the
leadership of Colonel William Campbell, Colonel Isaac Shelby, Lieutenant-Colonel
John Sevier, and Colonel Charles McDowell, had assembled at
Watauga, bent on the destruction of Ferguson and his little army.<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> To the
number of one thousand and forty they left their place of meeting on September
26th and marched for Gilberton, where Ferguson was supposed to
be. On the 30th they were joined by Colonel Cleveland, with three hundred
and fifty men from North Carolina. The senior officer was McDowell,
but from his slowness he was not deemed the best man to conduct such an
arduous enterprise, and while he was sent to Gates to name a leader they
chose Campbell for their chief. Pressing on, they reached the Cowpens,
where they were joined by Williams and Lacy, with about four hundred men
from the Carolinas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime Ferguson, not ignorant of the approach of this formidable
force, which appeared to have sprung from the earth, had begun his retreat
towards Charlotte. Anxious to intercept Clarke, he had delayed his march
longer than was prudent, and had taken post on the top of a spur of King's
Mountain, where he probably hoped to be reinforced before the enemy
should come up with him. While at the Cowpens, on October 6th, the
Americans received certain information of Ferguson's position. They
resolved to select the best mounted of their little army, and, leaving the
poorly mounted and the footmen to follow, to go in pursuit of Ferguson
and fight him wherever found. In the evening, therefore, they broke up
from the Cowpens, and, marching all night, reached, without being discovered,
the foot of King's Mountain on the afternoon of the next day. The
spot on which the British were found was singularly well suited to the mode
of fighting in which the backwoodsmen were adepts. King's Mountain
proper is sixteen miles long, and in some places is high and steep. The
southern end, however, where Ferguson was encamped, rises only about
sixty feet. It was wooded, except on the summit, which partook of the
nature of a plateau. The Americans, under their respective leaders, so
timed their movements that Ferguson was surrounded almost before he
knew it. The band led by Campbell seems to have made the first attack
from the south. It was speedily driven back at the point of the bayonet,
but re-formed at the foot of the hill and returned to the charge. Meantime
Shelby was pressing on from the north. He, too, was driven back, when,
re-forming his men, he also returned to the fight. These charges and countercharges
were three times repeated. Cleveland, Sevier, and the rest
did their work splendidly in their respective positions. The British, inspired
by the example of their heroic leader, fought bravely and well; but their
position was so perilous that their loss was double that of the assailants.
Ferguson, while leading a charge, or perhaps while endeavoring to cut his
way out, was killed. De Peyster, the second in command, showed the
white flag, as was his duty, resistance being useless, but the firing did not
cease for some time, even though the beaten Tories were suing for quarter.
At that moment an attack was made from the rear by another band of British,
who were probably returning from a foraging expedition. This new and
sudden attack led to a renewal of the slaughter of the unresisting foe on
the hill.</p>

<p>The neighborhood was bare of provisions, and the next morning the now
half famished victors, with their no less hungry prisoners, made a hurried
retreat towards the mountains. On the 13th the Americans arrived at a
place then called Bickerstaff's Old Fields, about nine miles from the present
hamlet of Rutherfordton. There they improvised a court, and sentenced
thirty to forty of their prisoners to death. But after nine had been hanged,
the remainder were reprieved or pardoned.</p>

<p>Such was the famous battle of King's Mountain in South Carolina. It
changed to a great extent the whole course of the war in the Southern department,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
as it deprived Cornwallis of the only corps that he could afford
to hazard for a long time out of supporting distance. As for Cornwallis,
as soon as he heard of the disaster, instead of sending Tarleton in pursuit,
he broke up from Charlotte, and retired as fast as he could to Wynnesborough,
in South Carolina, midway between Camden and Ninety-Six, where
he would be within supporting distance of either in case they were attacked.
He was followed by Gates, who encamped at Charlotte, his light parties
advancing even to Rugeley's.</p>

<p>Not long after his arrival at Wynnesborough, Cornwallis detached Tarleton,
with a portion of the Legion, to disperse the band with which Marion
awed the country between the Santee and Pedee rivers. Tarleton had
now to deal with a soldier both bold and discreet. All his artifices were
unavailing to entrap Marion, and he was recalled to go in pursuit of Sumter,
who had encamped at Fishdam Ford, not far from the British headquarters.
Meanwhile, Major Wemyss had attacked Sumter just before
daybreak on the morning of November 11th. He approached the camp
unchallenged at first, but he soon encountered a picket, which fired five
shots before retiring. Two shots disabled Wemyss. His second in command,
continuing the attack without a proper knowledge of the ground,
was repulsed. Sumter, hearing of the approach of Tarleton, prudently
withdrew from such a dangerous neighborhood, and had reached the ford of
the Tyger, near Blackstocks, when Tarleton appeared. Unable to cross,
he drew up his men on the side of a hill. Tarleton, rashly attacking with
his advance, was beaten off with great loss. The British leader withdrew
to his main body, and prepared to storm the hill the following morning; but
in the night Sumter crossed the river, and once over his men dispersed in
every direction. The American loss at these two actions was small, though
a wound received at the Blackstocks kept Sumter from the field for several
months.</p>

<p>From this time on the war in the Southern department assumed a new
and brighter aspect, for on December 2, 1780, less than a month after the
affair at the Blackstocks, Nathanael Greene arrived at Charlotte, and took
command of the remnants of the gallant Continentals who had fought so
splendidly at Camden. He was respectfully received by Gates, who retired
to his Virginia farm.<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a></p>

<p>The task that Greene had before him might well have appalled the boldest.
Without food, without money or credit, almost without an army, he
was expected to face the most enterprising commanders&mdash;Cornwallis, Rawdon,
and Tarleton&mdash;that the British had on this continent, while they were
at the head of a large and well-appointed army. But Greene was not the
man to be easily disheartened. With the possible exception of Washington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
the best soldier of high rank in the American army, he resembled his
chief in being a careful observer of men. His judgment, too, with regard
to all matters connected with war was excellent, and has seldom been surpassed.
As a strategist he had no equal in the opposing army, while he
possessed the rare power of being able to adapt his tactics to the army and
to the country, although it has been claimed that credit has been given him
for what really was the product of another mind.</p>

<p>Gates handed over to his successor an army which numbered on paper
twenty-three hundred and seven men, including nine hundred and forty-nine
Continentals. But so many were insufficiently clad and equipped that,
to use the new commander's own words, "not more than eight hundred
were present and fit for duty." Food was scarce, and the <i>morale</i> of the
army was low. Greene sought a new camp on the eastern bank of the
Pedee, opposite Cheraw Hill, where food was more abundant. There he
subjected his men to a discipline to which they had long been strangers,
while Morgan, with a strong detachment, threatened Cornwallis's other
flank.</p>

<p>Morgan took with him four hundred of the Maryland line, under Lieutenant-Colonel
J. E. Howard, two companies of Virginia militia, and about
one hundred dragoons led by William Washington. To these were afterwards
added more than five hundred militia from the Carolinas. Morgan
advanced to Grindall's Ford on the Pacolet, near its confluence with Broad
River. In this position he seriously menaced Ninety-Six and even Augusta
itself. Cornwallis needed to dislodge him before he could advance
far in his projected invasion of North Carolina. He therefore detached
Tarleton, with his Legion and a strong infantry support, against Morgan,
while he himself advanced with the main body along the upper road to
North Carolina, thus placing himself on Morgan's line of retreat whenever
that commander should be driven back. Learning of these movements,
Morgan retired from Grindall's Ford, and moving with commendable speed
on the night of January 16, 1781, encamped at the Cowpens. Tarleton was
now close upon him, and, marching the greater part of the night, he discovered
the Americans drawn up in line of battle on the morning of the 17th.
The position which Morgan had chosen was in many respects a weak one.
The country was well fitted for the use of cavalry, in which the British
excelled, while the Broad River, flowing parallel to his rear, made retreat
difficult if not impossible. Nor were the flanks protected in any manner.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
Hardly waiting for his line to be formed, and with his reserve too far in the
rear, Tarleton dashed forward.<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> A militia skirmish line was easily brushed
aside, and the main body of militia, after firing a few rounds with terrible
precision, also retreated. The Continentals, however, under their gallant
leader, stood firm. But Howard's flank soon became enveloped. He
ordered his flank company to change its front. Mistaking the order, the
company fell back, and the whole line was ordered to retire upon the cavalry.
The British, who had been joined by the reserve, thinking that the
Americans were retreating, came on like a mob. Seeing this, Howard
ordered the 1st Maryland to face about. They obeyed, and poured such an
unexpected and murderous fire into the advancing foe that the British line
paused, became panic-stricken, turned, and fled. In vain did Tarleton call
upon his dragoons for a charge. His order was either not delivered or
was misunderstood. Colonel Washington, on the other hand, advanced with
a rush, and the day was won. Almost to a man the British infantry was
either killed or captured. But they had fought well, and their loss, especially
in officers, bears testimony to their splendid conduct on the field.<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<p>King's Mountain lost to Cornwallis his best corps of scouts. This disaster
deprived him of his light infantry, whose presence during the forced
marches now to come would have been of incalculable service. For this
reason the affair at the Cowpens, while in reality only a fight between two
small bodies of troops, in importance of results deserves to be ranked among
the most important conflicts of the war. It was indeed, as has so often been
said, "the Bennington of the South."</p>

<p>Cornwallis, when he had detached Tarleton to the defence of Ninety-Six,
and later, when he had ordered him to push Morgan to the utmost, had
expected to be able to get on Morgan's line of retreat, and thus drive him
into the mountains, or at least prevent his rejoining Greene. But with
Greene on his flank at the Cheraws, he had been afraid to move far from
Camden before Leslie with the reinforcements could get out of Greene's
reach. He was, therefore, no further advanced than Turkey Creek, twenty-five
miles away, when the news of the disaster at the Cowpens reached him.
On the 18th, Leslie, with two battalions of the Guards under O'Hara and
the Hessian regiment of Bose, arrived. On the 19th the pursuit was begun,
and on the 24th Cornwallis reached the crossing of the Little Catawba at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
Ramsour's Mill, only to learn that Morgan had crossed at the same place
two days before. In fact, that enterprising leader, instead of being dazzled
by the victory at the Cowpens, passed the Broad River on the evening of
the day of action, and, pursuing his route toward the mountains, passed
Ramsour's Mill on the 21st. With the bulk of his detachment he then
sought a junction with the main body under Greene. Turning to the east,
he crossed the Catawba at Sherrald's Ford on the 23d, and took post on
the eastern bank. At this place he finally rid himself of his prisoners, sending
them to Virginia under an escort of militia.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt of the chagrin Cornwallis experienced at the
escape of Morgan. It prompted him to destroy what he thought was useless
baggage, and to make another attempt to overtake the Americans.
This burning of his train occupied two days, and, necessary as it may have
seemed, the consequent lack of supplies led to the fearful suffering of his
army after Guilford, and made his retreat to Wilmington a necessity. It
was his first grave error in his struggle with Greene. On the 27th he put
his troops in motion for the Catawba, but before he reached the fords a
sudden rise of the river made the crossing an impossibility, and gave Morgan
two days' respite. The delay was still more important in giving Greene
time to reach the post of danger and take command of the detachment.
The news of the victory at Cowpens had not reached the camp at the Cheraws
until the 25th. Instantly divining the course that Cornwallis would
pursue, Greene sent an express to Lee, who, as soon as he had joined, had
been dispatched to coöperate with Marion in an attack on Georgetown,
next to Charleston then the most important seaport in South Carolina. The
attack failed for some reason that is not quite apparent; but Lee brought off
his troops in safety, and rejoined Greene in time to render most important
service. On the 29th, the main army, under command of General Huger, left
the camp for Salisbury, where Greene hoped to be able to concentrate his
entire force. On the 31st the Catawba began to subside. Putting their
troops in motion, Greene and Morgan directed their steps toward Salisbury,
where they arrived on February 2d. The Yadkin was crossed in safety the
next day, though rising rapidly all the time; then sending orders to Huger
to join him at Guilford Court-House, and not at Salisbury as formerly
ordered, Greene once more breathed freely.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 1st, Cornwallis had also put his troops in motion.
His design was to make a feint of crossing at Beattie's Ford while with the
Guards he should pass the river at the less known Cowan's Ford. By some
means, Davidson, who commanded the militia in that region, became cognizant
of the design, and stationed himself at Cowan's with about four hundred
men, where he expected to hold Cornwallis in check long enough to
be of real service to the retiring Americans.</p>

<p>Shortly before daybreak Cornwallis reached the river, and saw the watch-fires
on the opposite bank. Without a moment's hesitation the Guards
rushed into the rapid stream. When about halfway across they were discovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
and a fire was opened upon them by the militia. But now occurred
one of those accidents that so often in war defeat the best-laid plans. The
ford, turning in mid-stream at an angle with the direct line, ran under a
bank where the militia were waiting for the British; but when they arrived
at the turning-point, instead of inclining to the right, the Guards&mdash;their
guide having deserted through fear&mdash;kept straight on, and gained the bank
with a loss of only sixty in killed, wounded, and missing. The militia retired,
and although Tarleton was sent after them, they made good their
retreat with a loss which would have been trifling but for a mortal wound
under which the gallant Davidson fell. There were many hair-breadth escapes
during this splendid charge. Cornwallis's horse was shot under him,
but reached the bank before he fell. Leslie was carried down stream, and
O'Hara's horse rolled over with his rider while in the water.</p>

<p>Pushing on with all speed possible in the wretched condition of the roads,
Cornwallis's van, under O'Hara, reached the Yadkin at the Trading Ford a
few hours after the Americans had crossed; but O'Hara, though he missed
the soldiers, captured a train of wagons belonging to the country people who
were flying with the army. Here again the forces of nature came to the
assistance of the Americans, for the Yadkin rose so rapidly that it could
not be forded, and Greene had carefully secured all the boats on the eastern
bank.</p>

<p>Cornwallis now gave up all idea of preventing the union of the two wings
of the opposing army, which, indeed, was effected soon after at Martinsville,
near Guilford. The British commander decided to place himself between
his opponents and the fords of the Dan, hoping thereby to prevent
the Americans taking refuge in Virginia. Accordingly, on the 7th he crossed
the Yadkin at the Shallow Ford. It was now a serious question with Greene
to escape the new danger. The militia failing to come to his aid, he was
obliged to protect his Continentals by a flight into Virginia. He determined
to cross the Dan at Irwin's Ferry, and sent orders to have boats ready at
that point. On the 10th the march was renewed. The light troops, united
in one division, were placed under the command of O. H. Williams, with
orders to delay the enemy as much as possible. By rapid marching the
main army reached Irwin's Ferry and crossed on the 13th and 14th, before
Williams and the rear-guard came in sight. The experience of this light
division has been well told by Lee, whose Legion first measured sabres
with Tarleton's men on the 12th. From that time the rear of the Americans
and the advance of O'Hara were almost constantly in sight of each
other. At every crossing or other suitable place Williams would draw his
men out and thus compel the British to deploy; then, his object being
accomplished, and the British delayed for a few minutes, the march would
be resumed, and the two armies would soon be marching as one again.
Cornwallis, conscious finally that his prey had escaped, turned back to
Hillsborough, and, erecting the Royal Standard, called upon all loyal North
Carolinians to rally to the aid of their royal master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 18th, only four days after his escape, recruits had come in so
rapidly that Greene detached Lee across the Dan to seek information, and
to show the Tories that the Americans were by no means beaten. Lee had,
in addition to his legion, two companies of the Maryland line. He was
joined on the southern side of the river by Pickens with a considerable
body of Carolina militia.</p>

<p>On the 23d Greene himself crossed the Dan with the main army, and
sought the difficult country on the head-waters of the Haw, as the Cape
Fear River is called in its upper course. Here again, as during the retreat,
the light troops were put into the hands of Williams. The two divisions
manœuvred with such precision that Cornwallis was held at arm's length,
while militia and Continentals came into the American camp from all directions.
The American commander saw that the time had now come to give
way no more. He stationed himself on a hillside near Guilford, and awaited
the approach of the British. The position which had attracted his attention
during the retreat possessed a combination of rising ground, cleared
spaces, and woods which could hardly be surpassed for the irregular formation
that Greene, following the example set by Morgan at the Cowpens,
deemed best suited to his troops.</p>

<p>To Cornwallis, the presence of Greene had been most disastrous.
Strategy had failed to annihilate his opponent, and the offered battle, even
on ground of the American general's own selection, was welcome to the
British commander; and on the morning of the 15th of March, 1781, the
trial came.</p>

<p>In his front line Greene put the North Carolina militia, their flanks
resting in the woods, the centre being protected in some measure by a
rail fence. Three hundred yards behind were posted the Virginia militia
under Stevens and Lawson. Though militia in name, some of those under
Stevens were veterans in reality. But, taught by his bitter experience at
Camden, Stevens posted riflemen behind his line, with orders to shoot any
who should run. The Virginians were entirely in the woods. Three to
four hundred yards behind them, on the brow of a declivity, with open
fields in their front, were the regulars. On the right was the Virginia
brigade under Huger. Then, after an interval for the artillery under Singleton,
came the Maryland brigade, commanded by Williams. The first
regiment was led by Gunby, with Howard as lieutenant-colonel. This
was the regiment which had aroused universal admiration by its splendid
conduct at Camden and its wonderful subordination at the Cowpens, when
a gallant charge converted a bloody check into a crushing disaster. The
second Maryland regiment, commanded by Ford, was new to the service.
It held the extreme left of the line. The regulars presented a convex
front. Lee with the "Legion" and Campbell's riflemen from the backwoods
acted as a corps of observation on the left, while Washington, with
the regular cavalry and the remnant of the Delaware regiment under the
heroic Kirkwood and Lynch's riflemen, protected the right flank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as Cornwallis found himself in the presence of his enemy, he
deployed without reserves, except the British dragoons under Tarleton.
The "Hessian" regiment of Bose and the 71st under Leslie, with the 1st
battalion of the Guards in support, held the right; next came the 23d and
33d regiments under Webster, with the Grenadiers and the 2d battalion
of the Guards under O'Hara in support; while the extreme left was occupied
by the light infantry of the Guards and the Jägers. The artillery
was on the road with Tarleton. As the line moved forward it first
encountered the North Carolinians, who fired a volley, and perhaps more,
before they broke. On the extreme right, however, Lee with his light
troops held the regiment of Bose and the 1st battalion of the Guards in
check. But the defection of the North Carolinians separated him from
the rest of the army. The first line being broken, Webster rushed upon
the Virginians. But the woods were so thick, and the defence of the Virginians
so stout, that his loss at this point was very considerable. At
length, Stevens having been wounded in the thigh, the Virginians retired
and Webster advanced upon the Continentals. On his right was Leslie
with the 71st. When the advancing line reached the front of the 1st
Maryland, it was received with such a murderous fire that it stopped. The
Marylanders then advanced with the bayonet, and the British gave way and
retreated. It has been said by writers on both sides, that had Greene
thrown forward another regiment at this moment the day would have
been won. But this is by no means certain, as the events of the next few
minutes were to show. For Leslie with the 71st and O'Hara with the
Guards now came up and assailed the 2d Maryland with such fierceness
that it broke and fled. But the 1st Maryland was not far off. Wheeling
into line, it opposed the Guards until Washington charged and broke the
British line. J. E. Howard&mdash;now in command, Gunby having been dismounted&mdash;then
followed with the bayonet, and pressed the enemy so hard
that re-formation was for the moment impossible. Cornwallis, seeing that
the flight must be stopped at all hazards, ordered his artillery&mdash;posted
on an eminence in the centre of the field&mdash;to open on the Marylanders
through the ranks of his own men. In this way the pursuit was checked,
though at terrible loss to the British.</p>

<p>Greene's hopes were soon dashed. The shattered lines of the enemy
re-formed and returned to the conflict. Pressing heavily on the Virginia
regulars, and reinforced by the 1st battalion of the Guards, which had
disengaged itself from Lee, the whole American line was endangered.
Greene, who wished to run no chances, and who probably did not know
that Lee had once more connected himself with the main line, ordered
a retreat. The artillery, the horses having been killed, was left on the
ground, but otherwise the withdrawal was easily and skilfully effected.</p>

<p>Such was the battle of Guilford. Numerically, Greene was superior;
but of good troops he had only a handful. When the two leaders summed
up their losses, it became evident that a decisive blow had been struck at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
Cornwallis. The Americans lost seventy-nine killed and one hundred and
eighty-four wounded, together with one thousand and forty-six missing.
Of these last some may have been wounded, but by far the greater part
were militiamen, who had returned to their homes. Cornwallis reported
his own loss at ninety-three killed, and four hundred and thirteen wounded,
and twenty-six missing&mdash;a most serious diminution of his force.</p>

<p>Cornwallis in his proclamation and letters maintained, however, that he
had achieved a great triumph. It was his despatch to Germain which
occasioned the well-known assertion of Charles James Fox that "another
such victory would destroy the British army." Even before the fight it
had been almost a necessity to open communications with the sea, as the
army was suffering for want of the stores that had been destroyed at
Ramsour's Mill. Believing the Cape Fear River navigable as far as Cross
Creek, Cornwallis had sent Major Craig to seize Wilmington and to open
navigation as far as possible, which he succeeded in doing to a point at a
short distance above Wilmington. Leaving his wounded at the New Garden
Quaker Meeting-house, near the battlefield, Cornwallis set out on the
morning of the 18th for Wilmington, arriving there on April 7, 1781.
Greene had pursued as soon as possible. But his ammunition, never very
abundant, was now almost exhausted. Besides, food was very scarce in the
district to be traversed, and Greene arrived at Ramsey's Mill only to find
that Cornwallis had built a bridge over Deep River at that point and
escaped, although Lee had pressed so hard on his rear that the bridge
could not be destroyed. Here the pursuit ended; for the Virginia
militia, now that their time was up, refused to serve longer. Though
Cornwallis escaped, and though Greene had lost one of the best contested
battles of the war, he had won the campaign. He was free once more to
turn his attention toward relieving South Carolina of her military rulers.
On April 6th, one day before Cornwallis arrived at Wilmington, the southward
march began, Lee being detached to operate on the line of Rawdon's
communications with Charleston.</p>

<p>Lee soon joined Marion, who was skulking in swamps between the Pedee
and Santee, and, uniting forces, the two captured a fortified depot of Watson,
the British officer scouring this region, and then endeavored to prevent
his rejoining Rawdon.</p>

<p>On the 7th of April Greene had broken up from Ramsey's, and, taking
the direct road, had encamped on Hobkirk's Hill, to the north of Camden,
and about a mile and a half from the British works at that place. As Rawdon
did not come out from his intrenchments, Greene on the 23d moved
nearer. Anxious for Marion and Lee, and desirous of supporting some
artillery which he detached to them, Greene moved to a position south of
Camden. It appears, however, that on the 23d or 24th he decided to fall
back. Accordingly, on the afternoon of the 24th he reëncamped on Hobkirk's
Hill. During that night a renegade drummer-boy informed Rawdon
of the position and number of the American force. He also said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
Greene had neither artillery nor trains near at hand, although both were
on the march to join him. It was a most propitious time to strike, and
Rawdon determined to attempt a surprise the next morning.</p>

<p>Making a considerable detour to the right, he struck the American left
almost unperceived. Greene had thrown out a strong picket in that direction,
but the superiority of the British was so great that they drove in the
guards and were upon the Americans before the formation was complete.
That the attack was not a disaster was due to the prudence of Greene, who
had encamped in order of battle. Perceiving that Rawdon's line was very
short, Greene ordered Ford with the 2d Maryland to flank it on the right,
and Campbell was told to do the same on the left. Gunby with the 1st
Maryland, and Hawes with the Virginia regulars, were ordered to attack
with the bayonet in front, while Washington with the cavalry was to get
into the rear and take advantage of any opening that might offer. Unfortunately,
neither Ford nor Campbell were able to put in their men before
Rawdon, seeing his danger, brought up his reserves and extended his flank.
This was owing partly to Ford being struck down in the beginning of the
movement.</p>

<p>The defeat of Greene, however, was due to one of those accidents against
which no foresight can provide. It seems that as the 1st Maryland was
getting into position to charge, or perhaps as it was moving forward, Beattie,
the captain of one of the leading companies, was shot. His men began
firing, and fell into confusion. Then Gunby, instead of pushing his rear
companies forward, as Greene always declared he should have done,
ordered the regiment to form on the rear companies. The men retiring
were seized with a panic, and the heroes of three battles broke. They
were rallied soon after, but it was then too late. The whole line was compromised,
and Greene ordered a retreat.</p>

<p>Though Greene was not surprised, the attack was most unexpected.
This was owing in a great measure to the woods in his front, which permitted
Rawdon to reach the picket line without discovery. Even then Greene
fully expected victory, and had his men done their duty, as he had a perfect
right to expect, this adventurous attempt of the young British commander
would have resulted in his complete overthrow. Such was Greene's
opinion, and such is the opinion of most American writers.<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> Retiring
first to Sanders Creek or Gum Swamp, the very spot Gates was trying
to reach when he met Cornwallis, and later to Rugeley's Mill, Greene
brought up his provisions and recruited the strength of his men. Though
not beaten at Hobkirk's Hill, Greene was greatly discouraged. Especially
distressing was the non-arrival of expected reinforcements. The terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
service of his best men were expiring, and he could see no source from
which to draw recruits. His losses in the recent engagement had not been
so great as those of his opponent; but Marion and Lee had been unable to
prevent Watson from rejoining his chief. Still Greene did not lose heart.
As soon as his men had recovered from fatigue he crossed the Wateree and
posted himself at Twenty-five-Mile Creek, on the road from Camden to
Fishing Creek and the Catawba settlements.</p>

<p>Watson reached Camden on May 7th. On the evening of the same day
Rawdon moved out from his fortifications, and, crossing the Wateree,
turned on Greene, intending to pass his flank and attack him from the rear.
But Greene was too vigilant, for, learning of Rawdon's departure from
Camden, he retired still higher up the river, first to Sandy's Creek and
later to Colonel's Creek, the latter being nine miles from his former position.
The position on the further bank of Colonel's Creek was very favorable
to the party attacked. The light troops had been left in the front, as
at Hobkirk's Hill. Coming upon them at Sandy's Creek, Rawdon mistook
them for the main body, and their position seemed so strong that he did
not feel willing to risk an attack. It was impossible for him to remain
longer in Camden with Greene in such threatening attitude, especially as
his line of communication with Charleston was in the hands of Lee and
Marion. On the 10th, leaving his wounded who were unable to be moved
at Camden, Rawdon evacuated that place, and marching to the east of the
Santee, he crossed at Nelson's Ferry and took post
at Monk's Corner, not more than thirty miles from
Charleston.</p>

</div></div>

<p>One of the motives which had induced Rawdon
to make this precipitate retreat was the hope of
saving the garrison of Fort Motte, an important
post on the Congaree, near its confluence with the
Wateree. Lee and Marion had appeared before
the place on the 8th. They had pushed the siege
with vigor, but were so destitute of artillery and
siege tools that it seemed the siege might be prolonged
until the coming of Rawdon should enforce
its abandonment. Happily it occurred to some
one that the roof of Mrs. Motte's house, which stood in the middle of
the inclosure, could be set on fire. It is related that Mrs. Motte herself
furnished the bow and arrows with which this was accomplished. At any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
rate, soon after Rawdon's watch-fires were seen in the distance the house
was on fire, the stockade untenable, and the garrison prisoners of war.
Marion then separated from Lee, and, turning toward Charleston, compelled
the enemy to look well to his communications.</p>

<p>When Rawdon evacuated Camden he sent orders to the commander at
Fort Granby to retire to Charleston, and directed Cruger, at Ninety-Six, to
join Brown at Augusta. Neither of these orders reached its destination.
As soon as the post at Motte's had surrendered, Lee was ordered to Fort
Granby. Proceeding with his usual celerity, he arrived before the place in
the night of the 14th. His single piece of artillery opened on the fort as
soon as the morning fog had dispersed. The garrison was completely taken
by surprise. Time being of the utmost importance to Lee, the besieged
were promised their baggage&mdash;in reality the property of plundered patriots&mdash;if
they would immediately surrender. The terms were accepted, and
Lee joined Pickens at Augusta.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a></p>

<p>Lee reached this place on the evening of the 21st of May. On his way
he had captured a small stockade, containing, under a strong guard, valuable
stores for the Indians. Augusta is, or rather was, situated on the
southern bank of the Savannah River. Its defences consisted of a strong
work, Fort Cornwallis, in the centre of the town. It was garrisoned by a
force of regulars under Lieutenant-Colonel Brown, who had already once
successfully defended the place. Not far from Fort Cornwallis was a smaller
work, named after its defender Fort Grierson. While Lee watched the garrison
of the larger fort, Pickens and Clarke advanced to the attack of Fort
Grierson. Its defenders soon were compelled to leave their stronghold for
the main fort. Their attempt to reach it was a vain one, as most of the garrison
were captured or killed.<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>The attack on Fort Cornwallis was now pressed with vigor. As at Fort
Watson, use was here made of an expedient, already tried in the campaign, of
advancing a log pen or Mahem tower, on the top of which was mounted the
besiegers' only piece of artillery, whence it was used with great effect. The
defence was most gallant, the garrison often sallying, and even attempting
to blow up a house in which a covering party of riflemen were to have been
placed; but the explosion was premature. Everything being ready for an
assault, the garrison capitulated after one of the most splendid defences of
the war. Lee then went to the assistance of Greene, who was now conducting
the siege of Ninety-Six.</p>

<p>The village of Ninety-Six was then situated near the Saluda River, about
twenty-five miles from Augusta. For many years a post had been established
there as a protection against the Indians. When the British overran
the State, it was selected as a proper position for one of the exterior line
of posts of which Camden was the most important, though the possession of
Augusta gave to the British the command of upper Georgia. When Camden
was evacuated, Ninety-Six became useless and should have been abandoned;
but the messengers bearing Rawdon's orders to that effect were stopped by
the Americans. When, therefore, Greene arrived before the place, on the
22d of May, he found it defended by Lieutenant-Colonel Cruger, with about
500 men, mainly New York loyalists. A stockade protected the rivulet
which supplied the garrison with water, and their main fort, the "Star",
had sixteen salient and reëntering angles. Greene was not strong enough
completely to invest this fort, and he contented himself with an attempt to
carry it by regular approaches.</p>

<p>This was Greene's first siege, and, unfortunately, he had no engineer of
the requisite ability. Acting on the advice of Kosciusko, ground was broken
at a distance of seventy paces from the "Star." The besieged soon sallied,
destroyed the uncompleted works, and retired with trifling loss, taking with
them the intrenching tools. The British were surprised at the temerity of
the Americans in opening their trenches so near. The sally taught Greene
a lesson, for he next opened a trench at a distance of four hundred paces,
under the protection of a ravine. The work was now pushed with vigor,
and, notwithstanding numerous sallies on the part of the garrison, by the
morning of June 18th the third parallel was completed. The assailants were
now within six feet of the ditch, while riflemen in a Mahem tower kept the
besieged from their guns during the day.</p>

</div>

<p>Lee with the "Legion" had arrived from Augusta on the 3d, and had
conducted operations against the stockade covering the watering-place with
such vigor that it had been evacuated on the 17th. Four days more would
have placed the garrison in the power of the besiegers. But it was not so to
be. Rawdon, in Charleston, had received considerable reinforcements direct
from Ireland, and early in June he pushed forward through the heat, and
eluded Sumter.<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> With Rawdon within a day's march, Greene must either
take the fort by storm or abandon the siege. He decided on an assault,&mdash;probably
more to satisfy the desires of his men than because he thought it
was the best thing to be done. On the 18th, at noon, the attack was made
in two columns, Greene not being willing to hazard his whole force in a
general storm. On the extreme right, Lee, with "Legion" infantry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
the remains of the gallant Delaware regiment, directed his efforts against
the stockaded fort, which had already been abandoned, according to the
British account of the siege. At all events, Lee had no trouble in carrying
out his part of the work. But on the other flank the assault was not so
successful. Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, with his Virginia regiment and
with the 1st Maryland, formed the storming column. They advanced with
great gallantry, but, though they gained the ditch, they could not effect a
lodgment on the parapet. They were driven back with considerable loss
by two parties of the besieged, which attacked them in the ditch on both
flanks in such a way that the artillery and riflemen in the tower could not
fire without injuring friend and foe alike. Greene called off his men, and
Rawdon being within a few miles, he retired on the next morning to a safe
place of retreat. In the end he retreated as far as Timm's Ordinary, between
the Broad and Catawba rivers. Rawdon, his men worn down with
their long march, could not overtake him, and finally halting on the banks
of the Enroree, he turned back to Ninety-Six. That place being untenable
with the means at his disposal, he divided his men into two parties. With
one he regained the low country, resigning the command to Stuart on
account of ill-health.<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> Gathering the Tories of the neighborhood, Cruger
escorted them to Charleston, while Greene led his army to the High Hills
of the Santee, where he passed the heats of the summer.</p>

<p>At length, toward the end of August, Greene learned that Stuart was
proposing to establish a fortified post at a strong and healthful position
called Eutaw Springs. Greene determined to prevent this, and descending
from his camp he made a wide detour to get across the river which separated
the two armies; for although he was distant from Stuart only sixteen
miles as a bird flies, the most practicable route was nearly seventy miles
long. He crossed the Wateree at Camden, and, marching parallel to the
river, crossed its affluent, the Congaree, at Howell's Ferry on the 28th and
29th. Proceeding by slow and easy marches, he reached Burden's plantation
on the 7th of September. At that place Marion joined him, and preparations
were made for an advance on the enemy the next day. Stuart at
Eutaw seems to have been singularly negligent. He sent out but one patrol,
which was captured by Lee. He would have been surprised had not two
men deserted from the North Carolina regiment and given him warning. As
it was, he had barely time to call in his foraging parties before Greene
was upon him.</p>

<p>Stuart had with him about 2,300 men of all arms, Greene rather less.
The British commander ranged his men in one line, the right being protected
by Eutaw Creek, while the left was in the air, as the military term
is. Greene advanced in two lines, the militia, under Marion, Pickens, and
Malmady, being in the front. The right of the second line was held by
Sumner with the North Carolina regulars. In the centre were the Virginia
Continentals under Campbell, while on the left J. E. Howard and Hardman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
led the two Maryland regiments. To Lee, who had the advance during the
march, was assigned the protection of the right flank, Henderson with a
South Carolina brigade covering the left. The cavalry under Washington
and the brave remnant of the Delaware regiment brought up the rear, and
acted as a reserve.</p>

<p>Here at last there was no wavering among the militia, excepting those
from North Carolina, who nevertheless fired several rounds before breaking.
Under Marion and Pickens the rest fought splendidly. It is said that
some of them fired no less than seventeen rounds before giving way; then
Sumner advanced with the North Carolina regulars. At length they, too,
were forced back; but the British following them with too great impetuosity,
their own line became deranged. This was the opportunity for the
men of Maryland and Virginia to retrieve the reputation lost at Guilford
and Hobkirk's Hill, and splendidly they responded to the call. Rushing
forward,&mdash;the Virginians alone disobeying orders so far as to fire,&mdash;the
whole burst upon the enemy in front and swept him from the field. Unfortunately,
their course led through the British camp, and they dispersed to
plunder the abandoned tents. Now it happened that when the British fell
back a party threw themselves into a strong brick house and an adjoining
picketed garden; thence they delivered a withering fire upon the victors
of a moment before. And more unfortunate still, when the "Legion" was
ordered to charge the retiring foe, Lee could not be found, and the charge,
being made without vigor, was a failure. On the right, too, the British had
not retreated: they still occupied a flanking position, from which they could
not be dislodged, even though Washington and all but two of his officers
were killed or wounded in the attempt. All these things, coupled with the
heat, compelled Greene to sound the retreat. Leaving such of the wounded
as were within range of the brick house on the field, he retired to his camp
at Burdell's, seven miles distant, that being the nearest point where a supply
of good water could be obtained. Both commanders claimed the victory.
It would be not unfair, perhaps, to call it a drawn battle. Neither
party can be said to have retained possession of the field, as Stuart retreated
with great precipitation from the vicinity on the night of the next
day. Greene acknowledged a loss in Continentals alone of 408 in killed and
wounded. The loss in militia has never been stated. It must have been
considerable, as a portion of the militia fought with great obstinacy. According
to the American accounts, the enemy lost in prisoners 500 men, including
70 wounded. But Stuart reported only 257 missing; his killed and
wounded he gives at 433.</p>

<p>As soon as Greene ascertained the retreat of the enemy he followed
with all speed; but Marion and Lee were too weak to prevent Stuart's
receiving a reinforcement. Stuart finally halted at Monk's Corner, while
Greene passed the Santee at Nelson's Ferry and retired to the High Hills.</p>

<p class="p2">Cornwallis at Wilmington had a difficult problem to solve. Should he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
go south to the relief of Rawdon, or north to the conquest of Virginia?
Another campaign in North Carolina was plainly out of the question. The
distances were so great and the country was so sparsely settled that it was
a matter of great difficulty to move any considerable force there, even when
unopposed. The recent campaign had fully demonstrated that a bold and
enterprising leader with a handful of trained troops could seriously impair
the usefulness of a royal army, even though he could not destroy it. The
best base of operations for another campaign in South Carolina was Charleston,
and the best way to get there was by water; but any such movement
looked too much like a retreat to be seriously considered. Besides, Cornwallis
did not believe that he could get to Camden in time to relieve Rawdon,
as the place was not provisioned for a siege. On the other hand, a
movement into Virginia offered many advantages. There the army would
always be within easy march of the sea, and reinforcements could be brought
from New York or sent thither with great ease. Then, too, it seemed to
Cornwallis&mdash;and his supposition was probably correct&mdash;that with Virginia,
the great storehouse of the Southern armies, once in his hands, the complete
conquest of the Carolinas would be easy and certain. So impressed was he
with this idea that he endeavored to induce Clinton to shift the headquarters
of the army from the Hudson to the Chesapeake; but Clinton had other
views, and New York remained the base of operations. Clinton even went
further, and avowed his dislike of the whole plan of operations; but Cornwallis
had the approval of Germain, and the northern movement was undertaken.</p>

<p>Clinton, however, had always looked with favor on desultory expeditions
to Virginia, as they drew the attention of that State to her own defence,
and therefore away from the defence of the Carolinas. As early as the
spring of 1779, he had sent Matthews and Collier to the Chesapeake, with
instructions to do as much damage to the Americans as possible; but
beyond plundering Portsmouth and burning Suffolk they accomplished
little, and returned to New York. The next year Leslie was detached in
the same direction to effect a diversion in favor of Cornwallis's invasion
of North Carolina. King's Mountain not only put an end to that invasion,
but compelled Cornwallis to call Leslie to his aid. Leaving Portsmouth,
which he had fortified, Leslie sailed for Charleston, and reached the
front in season to take part in the campaign against Greene. On Leslie's
withdrawal Clinton sent another expedition to Virginia to destroy military
stores which had been collected for the supply of Greene. The command
this time was given to Arnold, though, to guard against a new treason,
dormant commissions were given to his chief officers, Lieutenant-Colonels
Dundas and Simcoe. Arnold penetrated to Richmond without encountering
much opposition. He destroyed nearly everything of value at that
place, and then endeavored to seize some arms which had at one time been
deposited at Westham. Failing in this, he descended the river to Portsmouth.
The militia had now collected in considerable numbers. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
or for some other reason, Arnold kept within the fortifications of that
place.</p>

<p>About this time Rochambeau had sent a few vessels to annoy the British
in the Chesapeake; but, besides capturing the "Romulus",&mdash;a 44-gun ship,&mdash;they
did little, and returned to Newport. Washington now proposed that
the two armies should unite in an attempt to capture the traitor. To this
end he detached Lafayette with the light infantry,&mdash;a picked corps of
about twelve hundred men from the New England and New Jersey lines,&mdash;to
act in unison with a force of the same size which Rochambeau detached
from his army. Lafayette, for a time concealing his destination by a
feigned attack on Staten Island, reached Annapolis in safety. Leaving his
troops there, to be brought the rest of the way by the French fleet when
it should arrive, Lafayette proceeded to Suffolk. He found Muhlenberg,
with the militia, at that place, guarding the approaches to Portsmouth.
But the French were not fortunate, since their departure from Newport
was so long delayed that the fleet arrived off the Capes of the Chesapeake
only to find Arbuthnot guarding the entrance. In the fight which followed,
both sides claimed the victory. But all the advantages of victory
were on the side of the British, as Destouches' ships were so badly cut up
that he was obliged to return to Newport. Success now being improbable,
Lafayette returned to his troops, and the march to the North was
begun. At the Head of Elk new orders were found, directing him to return
to the South and place himself under the orders of Greene. The cause
of this radical change in plan was the reinforcement of two thousand men
under Phillips which Clinton had sent to Virginia.</p>

<p>Phillips arrived on March 25, and took command. Towards the end of
April, the British to the number of twenty-five hundred landed at City
Point on the James River. Steuben, who was then at Petersburg, took
up a strong position at Blandford, where the enemy found him on the
morning of April 25. He was soon obliged to retreat. The enemy then
marched to Petersburg, and destroyed a large amount of tobacco and other
valuable property. The 27th saw them at Osborn's, where they captured,
after some show of resistance, a fleet of merchant vessels.</p>

<p>When Phillips and Arnold arrived at Richmond they found that Lafayette
was before them. The young Frenchman had reached Baltimore on
the 17th of April. Purchasing on his own credit shoes and clothes suited
to a Virginia summer, he made a forced march, and threw himself into Richmond
twenty-four hours in advance of the British. Not wishing to attack
him in such a strong position, Phillips retired down the river, followed by
the Americans. On the 7th of the next month (May, 1781), the British
commander received word from Cornwallis that he would join him at Petersburg.
Suddenly ascending the river, he reoccupied that town on the night
of the 9th. On the 13th Phillips died, and a week later Cornwallis arrived
and assumed command, Arnold returning to New York.</p>

<p>Then followed a series of marches, the design of the British commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
being to cut Lafayette off from Wayne, who was marching to his support.
But Lafayette moved with too great celerity. Early in June the desired
junction of the Americans was made near Raccoon Ford, on the Rapidan.
Meantime, while Lafayette was out
of reach, Cornwallis sent out two expeditions.
The first, under Simcoe,
operated against Steuben, at that
time guarding the stores at the
Point of Fork. The Prussian veteran,
mistaking Simcoe's detachment
for the main army, abandoned
the stores and retired with great
precipitation. The second expedition,
led by Tarleton, was designed
for the capture of the civil rulers of
Virginia, but a Virginia Paul Revere
warned them of their danger in time,
and they made good their escape,&mdash;though
it is said that Jefferson,
then resting from the fatigues of the
session at Monticello, had but five
minutes to spare. But the raid,
successful, or not, had no importance, although popular writers are wont
to dwell upon it.</p>

</div></div>

<p>With Wayne and his Pennsylvanians, in addition to his own Light
Infantry, Lafayette felt strong enough again to oppose the enemy in the
field. By a well-executed movement through an unknown and long-disused
road, the young marquis placed himself between Cornwallis and Albemarle
Old Court House, whither the stores had been removed from Richmond.
Cornwallis, instead of attacking him, retired down the James, Lafayette
following at a distance of about twenty miles. On the 25th of June the
British were at Williamsburg, the Americans being not far off, at Bottom's
Bridge. While at Williamsburg, Cornwallis sent Simcoe to destroy some
boats and stores which had been collected on the Chickahominy. Lafayette,
on his part, detached Butler of the Pennsylvania line, with orders
to attack Simcoe on his return. A partial engagement ensued at Spencer's
Ordinary, which ended in Simcoe's being able to continue his retreat.</p>

<p>It can hardly be said that this retrograde movement on the part of the
British was due to the presence of Lafayette, although his presence undoubtedly
contributed toward making Cornwallis desirous of getting into
communication with Clinton. It is probable, too, that Cornwallis hoped to
be so strongly reinforced that the conquest of the State during the coming
autumn would be assured. But Clinton, believing, from intercepted despatches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
and from the movements of the Americans, that Washington was
meditating an attack on New York, instead of complying with Cornwallis's
desires, ordered him to send a portion of his own troops to New York.</p>

<p>The latter, therefore, retired to Portsmouth,
where the embarkation could be easily effected.
To Lafayette, the crossing of the James seemed
to offer the chance of at least picking off a rear
guard; but Cornwallis was attacked too soon,
owing in part to the impetuosity of Wayne, and
the onset came near being a disaster. In the
end, however, Wayne succeeded in bringing off
his men, though he lost two pieces of artillery.
Cornwallis, fearing an ambuscade, did not push
the pursuit. He then made his way to Portsmouth
unmolested, while the Americans sought
a healthy summer camp on Malvern Hill. Just
at this moment, owing to the arrival of reinforcements
in New York, Clinton decided to
leave Cornwallis's force intact. Furthermore,
he determined to establish a permanent base in
the Chesapeake, and ordered Cornwallis to fortify
a place, mentioning Old Point Comfort, where
the navy could be sheltered. He also authorized
him to take possession of some other post, as
Yorktown, if he thought it
necessary. Now Cornwallis
seems to have regarded the
fortifying of Yorktown as the
only alternative, and the engineers and naval officers declaring Old Point
Comfort unsuitable for a naval station, he seized York and Gloucester, and
began the erection of the proper works. Clinton always asserted that he
had no intention of ordering anything of the kind. But the weight of evidence
seems to be in favor of Cornwallis. At all events, he took possession
of Yorktown. As soon as his movements were discovered, Lafayette left
his summer camp, and, taking a strong position in the fork of the Pamunkey
and Mattapony rivers, sent out parties to watch the further movements of
the enemy, Wayne being ordered toward the south, as if to the assistance
of Greene. Such was the situation in Virginia when the French came to
the aid of the Americans, and began the operations leading to the siege of
Yorktown.</p>

<p>On the 1st and 2d of May, 1780, the Marquis of Rochambeau, with
about five thousand men, left the roadstead of Brest. The transports were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
convoyed by a small fleet of seven ships of the line, under the command of
the Chevalier de Ternay. Their progress was slow, and it was not until
July 12th that the fleet anchored in Newport harbor.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> Batteries were immediately
erected on shore to protect the shipping from the English fleet,
which was under Arbuthnot. This admiral, hastening from Charleston, in
company with Clinton, now bent his whole energy toward the destruction
of the French fleet. But the British commanders, always on bad terms,
quarrelled, and Washington threatening New York, while the New England
militia rallied to the defence of their newly arrived allies, the attempt
on Newport was abandoned. A naval blockade was kept up, however, and
the French army was neutralized by a few ships of war. Thus they passed
the remainder of 1780 and the first part of 1781.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May (1781) M. de Barras, successor to De Ternay, who
had died in the preceding year,<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> arrived at Boston. He brought news of
the departure from Brest of a powerful fleet commanded by M. de Grasse.
This French admiral had with him a small convoy with six hundred recruits
for Rochambeau; but the bulk of his fleet was destined primarily for the
West Indies. De Grasse had been directed, however, to come on the
American coast in July or August, relieve the fleet at Newport, and for a
limited period act in conjunction with the American and French armies.
On May 21st a conference between Washington and the French commanders
was held at Weathersfield, in Connecticut. It was there determined
to make a united attack upon New York, provided De Grasse could coöperate.
This was Washington's plan, though an expedition against the British
in Virginia seems even then to have been proposed. Later a note from
De Grasse arrived, asking where he should strike the American coast. Rochambeau
replied that it would be best for him to look into the Chesapeake,
and then, should no employment be found there, to proceed to New
York. Rochambeau also inclosed the articles of the Weathersfield conference,
hinting at the same time that De Grasse must be his own judge as
to the practicability of crossing the New York bar with his ships. Finally
he asked him to borrow for three months the brigade under St. Simon,
which was destined to act in conjunction with the Spaniards.</p>

<p>On the 18th the advance of the French left Providence for the Hudson.
Washington at this time was encamped at Peekskill. Ten days later, on
June 28th, he determined to seize by surprise, if possible, the forts on the
northern end of New York Island. The night of July 2d was selected for
the enterprise, and the command of the advance was given to Lincoln;
Lauzun, with the French Legion, making a forced march to his aid. But
the scheme failed. The enemy attacked Lincoln, and Lauzun reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
scene of conflict too late to be of assistance. The troops were drawn off
in safety, however, and retired to Dobbs Ferry, where they were joined
by the French infantry on July 6th. While awaiting the arrival of the
fleet, nothing was attempted beyond a reconnoissance in force of the northern
defences of the island. It was this movement which induced Clinton
to send for the Virginia troops.</p>

<p>On August 14th a letter from De Grasse arrived which put a new face
on the whole war; for the French admiral announced that he should sail
for the Chesapeake, with a view to carry out the scheme of Rochambeau
for a united movement against Cornwallis. He added that his stay on the
American coast would be short, and that he hoped the land forces would be
ready to act with him.</p>

<p>There was now nothing to be done but to abandon the cherished project
against New York, and to move all of the allied armies that could be spared
from the vicinity of New York to the Chesapeake. Leaving Heath with
four thousand men to garrison the forts on the Hudson, and suitable parties
to guard against an irruption from Canada, Washington set out with
the rest of the land forces for Williamsburg, by the way of Philadelphia,
Head of Elk, and the Chesapeake. On the 19th the army crossed the Hudson
at King's Ferry, and moved as though to attack Staten Island. This
feint was so well managed that Clinton was completely deceived. On September
2d the Americans marched through Philadelphia, the French following
on the 3d, 4th, and 5th. By the 8th the allied army was again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
united at the Head of Elk. The news of the arrival of De Grasse at the
Capes of the Chesapeake had reached Washington on the 5th, and had
been communicated to the troops on the following morning.<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a></p>

<p>De Grasse, on his arrival at Lynnhaven Bay, just inside Cape Henry,
had found an aide of Lafayette's, and soon the marquis arrived in person.
As soon as possible the troops under St. Simon were landed at Jamestown
Island, and Wayne was recalled from his southward march. These corps,
with the light infantry and the Virginia militia, took up a strong position at
Williamsburg, not more than twelve miles from Yorktown. Cornwallis
reconnoitred the lines; but they were too strong to be attacked except at
great risk. Confident in being relieved by Clinton and Graves, he retired
to his fortifications.</p>

<p>Had Rodney done his full duty he would have followed De Grasse in his
northward cruise. But pleading illness, he sent fourteen ships of the line,
under Hood, to the assistance of Graves, and sailed himself for Europe.<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a>
The event was most fortunate for the American cause, as the control of the
sea for a brief period passed away from the British. It should be said that
Rodney had written to Graves, warning him of his danger; but through a
fortunate accident the letter never reached Graves, and the first he heard
of the coming of De Grasse was on the arrival of Hood. That admiral on
August 25th had looked into the Chesapeake on his way north; but the
French had not yet arrived. Graves had already discovered that Barras
had sailed from Newport with a siege train and tools, and the two admirals,
conjecturing, therefore, that the destination of Barras was the Chesapeake,
determined to seek him there and destroy him before the arrival of the main
fleet. They reached Cape Henry on the 5th of September, and there they
found, not Barras, as he had purposely taken a long, roundabout route to
avoid them, but De Grasse. The English fleet numbered nineteen sail of the
line, the French twenty-four, but fifteen hundred men were absent, engaged
in landing the troops of St. Simon. Nevertheless, De Grasse slipped his
cables and stood out to sea. The ensuing action was indecisive, but De
Grasse accomplished his purpose, as the British were obliged to seek New
York to refit. On his arrival back at Lynnhaven Bay he found Barras.
There was now abundant transportation, and by the 26th of September the
allied troops&mdash;Washington's, Rochambeau's, Lafayette's, and St. Simon's&mdash;were
concentrated at Williamsburg.</p>

<p>Two days later, on the 28th, the allied army marched to Yorktown, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
found Cornwallis occupying an intrenched camp outside the immediate defences
of the town. On the 29th the lines were extended so as to envelop
the place, the Americans taking the right, with their right flank resting on
Wormley Creek. Cornwallis, seeing that he would be outflanked, withdrew
to the inner defences, and on the morning of the 30th the besiegers took
possession of the abandoned works.<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a></p>

<p>On the night of the 5th and 6th of October the first parallel was opened,
at a distance of between five and six hundred yards from the enemy's works.
It extended from the river bank below the town to a deep ravine nearly
opposite the centre of the besieged lines. A battery on the bank above the
town opposed a battery of the enemy in that quarter, and also prevented
the British fleet from enfilading the works. Guns were mounted and fire
opened from this parallel on the afternoon of the 9th. The ground was
singularly favorable to the construction of the approaches, and by the night
of the 11th and 12th the works were in such a state of forwardness that the
second parallel was begun, not more than three hundred yards from the
British lines. On the extreme right, however, there were two redoubts,
commanding this parallel, which on the night of the 14th and 15th were
carried by storm,&mdash;the smaller one, on the right, by Lafayette's division,
the advance being commanded by Alexander Hamilton; while the one further
away from the river was stormed by a party of French infantry commanded
by Colonel G. de Deux-Ponts, the Baron de Viomenil having command
of the division. The loss on the American side was inconsiderable,
but that of the French was severe, the redoubt carried by them being larger
and much more strongly garrisoned. Before morning the two redoubts
were included in the second parallel. Cornwallis, hoping for relief, determined
to prolong the defence as long as possible. To this end, on the
morning of the 16th, Lieutenant-Colonel Abercrombie led a determined
but useless assault on two batteries at the French end of the trenches.
Cornwallis next tried, on the night of the same day, to cut his way out by
passing his men over to Gloucester Point; but a storm arose in the midst
of the ferrying, and the enterprise, hazardous at best, was abandoned.</p>

<p>An assault becoming practicable, at ten o'clock of the morning of the
17th, four years since Burgoyne's surrender, a drummer-boy appeared on
the parapet and beat a parley. Negotiations were begun, but, though
pushed with the greatest energy by Washington, the final articles were not
signed in the trenches until two days later, on the 19th. On that day, at
noon, two redoubts were taken possession of by detachments from the
French and American forces. At two in the afternoon the British army,
with colors cased and drums beating "The World turned upside down",
marched out and laid down their arms; O'Hara, in the absence of Cornwallis,
making the formal surrender to Lincoln, Washington's representative.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the siege the British numbered not far from seven
thousand men of all arms,&mdash;perhaps a few more. On the day of the capitulation,
according to Cornwallis, little more than thirty-eight hundred were
fit for duty, including the garrison at Gloucester Point. The allied army is
usually given at sixteen thousand men,&mdash;nine thousand Americans, including
thirty-five hundred militia. The French numbered probably more than
seven thousand. The total British loss during the siege was five hundred
and forty-one, including the missing. The allied loss, excluding the missing,
was seventy-six Americans and one hundred and eighty French. It
has been stated that, at the time of the surrender, there were about fourteen
hundred unfit for duty in the allied camp. This great victory, due
even more than most victories to chance, virtually ended the war. It
remains only to describe the closing scenes in the South.</p>

<p>Greene's army had been so roughly handled at the Eutaws that it was
the first of November before he felt strong enough again to take the field.
He advanced first to Dorchester and the Round O. Then, reinforcements
arriving from the troops set free by the surrender at Yorktown, he assumed
a more vigorous offensive. He advanced to the eastern bank of the Edisto,
between Jacksonborough, where the legislature was then assembling, and
Charleston, still in the hands of the British. But if the Pennsylvanians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
were a welcome addition on account of their strength, they brought also a
spirit of discontent. A plot was discovered to betray the army into the
power of the enemy. A few examples were made and the attempted treason
stamped out.</p>

<p>Greene now detached Wayne, with about five hundred men, to do what
he could toward the recovery of the Georgia seaboard. On his approach
the British retired to Savannah, burning everything that could not be
removed. Wayne was too weak to attempt more than the blockade of the
town. But on the 21st of May Lieutenant-Colonel Brown left the fortifications
as if to attack the Americans. Placing himself between this party
and the garrison, Wayne surprised Brown by a night attack, killing or dispersing
the whole party. About a month later he was himself surprised by
a large body of Creek Indians led by a British officer. Successful at first,
the savages were finally beaten off, with the loss of their chief Escomaligo
and a dozen braves. On the 11th of the next month, July, 1782, Savannah
was evacuated, and the whole State once more came into the hands of the
Americans.</p>

<p>The British government had decided upon the abandonment of all posts
in America with the exception of New York. On August 7th, Leslie,
then commanding in the South, announced in "after orders" that the
evacuation of Charleston had been determined on. He also wrote to
Greene, proposing a cessation of hostilities. The proposal was declined,
Greene having no instructions on the point. Later Leslie again wrote,
offering to pay for all rice and other provisions that might be brought into
Charleston; but Greene, fearing that the rice was intended for use during
a campaign against the French in the West Indies, again refused. Leslie
then endeavored to seize the coveted articles by force. One of his foraging
parties, commanded by Lieutenant Benjamin Thompson,&mdash;better known
by his later title of Count Rumford,&mdash;surprised and dispersed Marion's
brigade while its commander was absent attending a meeting of the legislature.
The most serious loss through these desultory expeditions was in
the death of the younger Laurens, who was killed during a useless skirmish
at Combahee Ferry. This was the last action of the war in the South.
On the 14th of December the British left Charleston, and three days later
their last ship passed the bar and went to sea. The South was free.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE most complete contemporary account of the Southern campaign is David Ramsay's
<i>Revolution of South Carolina</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> This author, by birth a Pennsylvanian,
removed to Charleston in 1773, and at once took a leading part in the management of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
affairs of that town. During the stormy years of 1779-1780 he was a member of the
governor's council, but went with the Charleston artillery company to the siege of
Savannah. When Rutledge, with a portion of his council, left Charleston during the
siege, Ramsay remained behind with Gadsden. He was, therefore, a prisoner during the
greater portion of Gates's and Greene's campaigns. Ramsay was thus a prominent actor
in many of the scenes described in his volumes, while his facilities for obtaining accurate
information as to the rest were so excellent that his book may be regarded as an authority
of the first importance. He retold the story in a condensed form in several other
publications.</p>

of Charleston. After that he resided with the other officers at Haddrell's Point
until his exchange in 1781. At a later day he was present at the entry of the victorious
army into Charleston. Whenever he speaks from his own observation, Moultrie may be
trusted<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a>. But he seems to have been too ready to listen to exaggerated stories, and
though we must believe that there was a foundation for his account of the sufferings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
the Charleston prisoners, it should always be remembered that the charges were indignantly
denied by the British officers in charge.</p>

         <p class="pf400"><span class="smcap">Portraits of General Greene.</span>&mdash;One of
the earliest of the contemporary prints is the
rude copperplate, made by the Boston engraver
Norman, which appeared in the Boston edition
(1781, vol. ii. p. 229) of <i>An Impartial History of
the War in America</i>. A fac-simile is annexed.
In 1785, Andrews' <i>History of the War</i>, published
in London (vol. i.), had a youthful picture, a reproduction
of which is also given herewith. The
next year the <i>Columbian Magazine</i> (Sept., 1786),
published in Philadelphia, gave an engraving
after R. Peale's likeness of Greene, of which a
better engraving by Robert Whitechurch can be
found in Irving's <i>Washington</i> (ii. p. 8) and in E.
M. Stone's <i>French Allies</i> (p. 496). In 1794 the
<i>New York Magazine</i> (May) gave as from an original
painting a copperplate engraving, of which
a fac-simile is given on another page. It is evidently
a rendering of the canvas of which, after a
photograph given in George W. Greene's <i>Life of
Greene</i>, the woodcut on the page opposite to the
other is a more adequate representation. There
is also a print in the <i>Monthly Military Repository</i>,
N. Y., 1796-1797. A portrait by C. W.
Peale was engraved, while in the Philadelphia
Museum, by Edwin, and appeared in Lee's <i>Memoirs
of the War in the Southern Department</i>
(vol. i., Philadelphia, 1812). It was again engraved
by James Neagle in 1819 for Charles
Caldwell's <i>Memoirs of the life and character of
the Honorable Nathanael Greene</i> (Philadelphia,
1819); and in 1822 it furnished the head and
shoulders, turned in the opposite direction, for
the full-length figure, engraved by J. B. Longacre,
after a drawing by H. Bounetheau, which is in
the first volume of William Johnson's <i>Sketches
of the life and correspondence of Nathaniel Greene</i>
(Charleston, 1822). One of the pleasantest of
the likenesses of Greene is that painted by Col.
John Trumbull, which was engraved by J. B.
Forrest for the <i>National Portrait Gallery</i> (New
York, 1834). The same picture is selected by
W. G. Simms for his <i>Life of Greene</i>, and it is
given in R. E. Lee's ed. of Henry Lee's <i>Memoirs
of the War</i> (N. Y. 1869), and H. B. Anthony's
<i>Memorial Address</i> (Providence, 1875) on presenting
the statue of Greene to Congress. This
statue, modelled by Henry K. Brown, was offered
in 1870, and a cut of it is given in the <i>Presentation
of the Statue of Major-General Greene in the
Senate</i>, Jane 20, 1870 (Washington, 1870), an account
of which, under the title of <i>Proceedings in
Congress attending the reception of the statue of
Maj.-Gen. Greene</i>, was reprinted (twenty copies)
in Providence the same year. For congressional
documents pertaining, see B. P. Poore's <i>Descriptive
Catal. of U. S. Gov't publications</i>, pp.
896, 901, 1221. Congress voted a medal to
Greene after the battle of Eutaw, and on one
side it bears a profile likeness of Greene. It is
engraved in Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 704; and
in <i>Ibid.</i> p. 720, is a view of the monument erected
to the memories of Greene and Pulaski. The
Polish hero has since, however, been commemorated
in a separate monument, so that the shaft
first erected is now called a memorial of Greene
alone. Greene died in 1786 of a sunstroke, at
a plantation near Savannah, which had been
given to him by the State of Georgia,&mdash;it being
the confiscated estate of the late royal lieutenant-governor,&mdash;and
he was buried in Savannah; but
when the monument was built, the search to discover
his remains was unsuccessful. Cf. <i>The
Sepulture of Greene and Pulaski, by C. C. Jones,
Jr.</i> (Augusta, 1885)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Henry Lee, of Virginia,&mdash;"Light-Horse" or "Legion Harry", as he was often called,&mdash;though
not in the South prior to the days of the Cowpens, was so intimate with all the
actors in the operations after the fall of Charleston, and enjoyed such advantages for
acquiring information of earlier events, that as a source of information his book<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> is of
considerable value. As the work of an outspoken and generally impartial military critic of
these campaigns, it has no equal. It should be borne in mind, however, that as to dates
and minor details it needs the confirmation of contemporary documents.<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> Like so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
of the Revolutionary heroes, Lee in his later years became involved in unfortunate speculations,
and a painful disease increased the distress of his last days.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> As an orator he
fashioned phrases which have not yet lost their hold on the popular mind. As a writer
he avoided the stilted sentences of his contemporaries, and his book may still be read
with pleasure. Probably no one enjoyed the confidence of Greene to such an extent as
Henry Lee.<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a></p>

<p>Nathanael Greene came of good Rhode Island stock,<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> and, like other prominent Rhode
Islanders of his day, was a self-educated man. Fortunately for posterity, though not always
for himself, Greene was a copious and candid letter-writer. His letters and fragments
of letters, so far as they have been printed, are his best biography.<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> He has not lacked
biographers, however. First, in point of time, was Charles Caldwell, who put forth a
worthless volume as early as 1819.<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> William Gilmore Simms, the Carolina novelist, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
tried his hand at the alluring theme, and his book, while possessing no claim to originality,
has at least the merit of being interesting. The most formidable of these early biographies
was the work of Judge Johnson, of Charleston. He enjoyed the best facilities, as
the Greenes placed the family papers at his disposal. Many of these documents he printed
at length, and as a repository his work has a value.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> In other respects it is worth very
little. This is due mainly to the fact that in order to glorify his hero he belittled every
other prominent character&mdash;with the exception of Marion.<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> A formidable antagonist of
Johnson was soon found in the person of Henry Lee, the son of Light-Horse Harry. He
resented the slurs of Johnson, and even wrote a book<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> to show the small reliance to be
placed on the learned judge's military criticisms. As a review, the work of the younger
Lee is interesting, but it is so one-sided as to be of little importance.</p>

<p>It is, however, to the labors of a descendant that the great leader owes much of the
honor in which he is held. In various publications, from the little seven-page sketch
in the <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History</i> (vol. ii. p. 84) to the large three-volume biography,<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a>
the grandson sought to spread the fame of the grandsire. Unfortunately, through
these family works of love there runs the same spirit of adulation that so disfigured
Johnson. A still greater drawback to the value of the largest work is the hesitation of
the author in printing letters and documents not elsewhere in print.</p>

<p>In this respect the biographer of Greene's able lieutenant, Daniel Morgan, set a good
example. In fact, Graham's <i>Morgan</i><a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> is an excellent and generally trustworthy book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
It is to be noted that Graham has cleared Morgan from the charge that he retired from
the army after the Cowpens, through a treasonable fear that the Revolution would not
be successful. Nor does the assertion that Morgan was chagrined at the treatment
accorded him by Greene appear to be well founded.</p>

<p>But of all the Southern leaders, Marion was most fortunate in his biographers.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> It
is true that Horry's work was largely written by Mason L. Weems, notorious for his
so-called <i>Life of Washington</i>. Both Horry and James had a foundation for their narratives.
The confidence reposed by Greene in his ablest leader of irregular troops is
best seen in their letters printed by Gibbes in his <i>Documentary History</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> which is composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
mainly of the "Horry Papers", already used in Horry's memoir. Another partisan
worthy of mention was Pickens. But of him only slight and unworthy sketches have
been printed.<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a></p>

<p>The only extended notice of Benjamin Lincoln is the biography by Francis Bowen in
Sparks's collection.<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> This book was not written in the calm judicial spirit that should
characterize an historical work. Many of Lincoln's order-books have been preserved, and
have been of material service in preparing the foregoing narrative. Though Lincoln's
career was marked by no brilliant successes, his work was always well done, and demands
a fuller recognition.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a></p>

<p>Little original material concerning the operations in Georgia has come to light. It is
fortunate, therefore, that Hugh McCall overcame his physical infirmities to such an extent
as to enable him to finish the second volume of his <i>History of Georgia</i>. This writer
was an active cavalry leader in the defence of his native State. He also fought well
on other fields. It should he said, however, that what he wrote of actions in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
did not take part should be received with caution. His work is the basis of all subsequent
accounts of the war in Georgia.</p>

<p>Anthony Wayne and his Pennsylvanians did good service in Virginia, and later in Georgia.
But the life of Wayne remains to be written.<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> His letters and reports are scattered
here and there through the books. The best account of his career is the one printed by
his son in the <i>Casket</i>, a magazine not to be found in every library.</p>

<p>The second volume of Wheeler's <i>Sketches of North Carolina</i> contains many articles
by actors in the struggle. But they were mostly written long after the event, as, too,
were those in the <i>North Carolina University Magazine</i>. They should not be relied upon
unless confirmed.<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> This is the more regrettable as there is very little original material in
print relating to these North Carolina campaigns from a North Carolina point of view.
The most labored defence of the "Old North State" is Caruthers' <i>Incidents</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> Much
of this work seems to be based on good material; but one should be especially careful to
separate such portions from those founded on tradition, which must have misled Caruthers
in several instances. Of the same general character are Johnson's <i>Traditions</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a> Logan's
<i>Upper Country of South Carolina</i>; Foote's <i>Sketches of Western North Carolina</i>;
and C. L. Hunter's <i>Sketches of Western North Carolina</i> (Raleigh, 1877). Such are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
main sources of information from the American side so far as the campaigns in the
Carolinas and Georgia are concerned. Let us now turn to Virginia.</p>

<p>On his way South, Greene left Steuben<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> in Virginia to organize and push forward
recruits as fast as possible. The gallant Prussian seems to have been ill-suited to the
command of raw republican militia; but the American leaders in the State, Muhlenberg,
Lawson, and Stevens, aided him as well as they could. It was not until the arrival of
Lafayette with his Continentals from the Eastern States that much was done to oppose
the enemy. The governor of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, showed a lamentable lack of
energy during Arnold's and Cornwallis's invasions, though the word "imbecility", applied
to his conduct by Howison, would seem to be undeserved.<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> Of course, Jefferson's
biographers have defended their hero from these charges,<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> but Giradin's <i>Continuation
of Burk's Virginia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> written in the neighborhood of Monticello, and apparently under
Jeffersonian auspices, is the most extensive account of Jefferson's administration from
his side.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until the publication of the <i>Virginia State Papers</i><a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> that the truth
concerning the campaigns preliminary to Yorktown could be ascertained. But these two
volumes taken in connection with the <i>Nelson Papers</i> have thrown a new light on all these
transactions.<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a></p>

<p>Washington's <i>Writings</i> and Sparks's <i>Correspondence of the Revolution</i> contain much
relating to all these operations, though Washington's <i>Journal</i> and his order-books are
even more valuable for the Yorktown campaign. Of the commander of the auxiliary
troops, the Marquis of Rochambeau, I have found little outside of his well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
<i>Mémoires</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> For much of what we know concerning the movements of the French we
are indebted to John Austin Stevens, a former editor of the <i>Magazine of American History</i>.
His articles, as well as those by other hands, will be mentioned in the Notes.</p>

<p>The papers of the British commanders have been much better preserved. All official
documents of popular interest and conducing to the glory of the nation were published,
sometimes in full, sometimes in extract, in the governmental organ known as <i>The London
Gazette</i>. Thence they were copied, in whole or in part, into the <i>Remembrancer</i>, <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i>, <i>Scot's Magazine</i>, <i>Political Magazine</i>, and often into that portion of
the <i>Annual Register</i> known as "Principal Occurrences." Many of them, and many other
papers of the greatest importance, were printed in the <i>Parliamentary Register</i>, or Debrett's
<i>Debates</i>, as it is often called.</p>

<p>The Sackville Papers, forming the third appendix to the <i>Ninth Report</i> of the Royal
Commission on Historical Manuscripts,<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> contain much of very great value; but many of
the most important papers therein printed have been accessible in other forms. Soon
after the surrender at Yorktown, the House of Lords appointed a committee to inquire
into the conduct of the Yorktown campaign. Later, upon their order, many of the letters
and papers bearing on this event were printed. They may be found in the <i>Parliamentary
Register</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> while many were translated into French, and published in a small volume under
the title of <i>Correspondance du Lord G. Germain avec les Généraux Clinton, Cornwallis</i>,
etc. (Berne, 1782). Most of these documents, however, had been already printed in other
places. The surrender induced Cornwallis<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> and Clinton to lay upon the shoulders of each
other the responsibility.<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> The truth seems to be that neither was responsible, since the
disaster was due, above all, to the arrival of De Grasse and the consequent transference
of the control of the sea from the British to the Allies. For this neither Clinton nor Cornwallis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
was to blame. The quarrel led to the publication, however, of so many papers of
the greatest importance that the historical student can hardly regret its occurrence.</p>

<p>Nor was Clinton on good terms with Mariot Arbuthnot, who had accused Clinton of
permitting thievery to go on under his very eyes.<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> Naturally this want of cordiality made
coöperation very difficult. After Clinton's departure Cornwallis was the commander-in-chief
in the South; but Colonel Nesbit Balfour, who commanded in the city of Charleston,
made separate reports to Germain. He does not seem to have been possessed with
a very sanguine disposition, and his reports therefore present a more accurate picture of
affairs than do the despatches of Cornwallis himself.</p>

<p>Several of the British officers wrote formal accounts of their doings, the most notable
of which is Tarleton's <i>Campaigns</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> Portions of it are trustworthy, but in general the
author placed his own services in such a favorable light that the true course of history
is almost unrecognisable. Nevertheless, the book contains so many documents not elsewhere
to be obtained, except at great labor, that it has a value. Tarleton's unjust discriminations
and criticisms brought forth a most caustic review from the pen of Mackenzie,<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
a Scotch officer, who served in a regiment which often accompanied the "Legion." Cornwallis,
who had also been attacked by Tarleton, never replied to his criticisms in print;
but he wrote to a "friend" (cf. letter dated Calcutta, Dec. 12, 1787, in the <i>Cornwallis
Corres.</i>, i. 59, note) that "Tarleton's is a most malicious and false attack; he knew and
approved the reasons for several of the measures which he now blames. My not sending
relief to Colonel Ferguson, although he was positively ordered to retire, was entirely
owing to Tarleton himself: he pleaded weakness from the remains of a fever, and refused
to make the attempt, although I used the most earnest entreaties." It should be noted,
however, that this alleged refusal on Tarleton's part created no coolness at the time. Simcoe's
narrative<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> is even more egotistical than Tarleton's. But his details may be relied
upon if one constantly remembers that events are related without any regard to their real
importance. Captain, afterwards General, Graham served with Cornwallis in the 76th Highlanders
through the most important portions of his North Carolina and Virginia campaigns.
His <i>Memoirs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> therefore, though execrably edited so far as the American portion is concerned,
should be consulted. Another book which partakes of the nature of an original
source is the so-called <i>Journal</i><a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> of R. Lamb, who served through the war, and his statements
have a value. The only regimental history of much interest is Hamilton's <i>Grenadier
Guards</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> a corps which after Cowpens rendered good service, and this account of
their achievements bears all the marks of originality. There are but few manuscripts of
importance, written by British officers, accessible on this side of the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

<p>The most valuable history of the Revolution from a British pen is Gordon's well-known
work. This author was assisted by Gates and Greene so far as the Southern campaigns
were concerned. The volumes contain, moreover, many fragments of letters that have
never seen the light in their entirety. Taken altogether, this work ranks with Ramsay as
an authority of the very first importance. The only other important <i>History of the American
War</i> from the English side is the work which bears the name of Charles Stedman
on the title-page. Whoever the author of the text may have been, the writer of many
of the notes in the part devoted to the war in the South was undoubtedly an on-looker.
Still another work worthy of mention in this place, though mainly as the repository of
documents, is Beatson's <i>Memoirs</i>. In addition there are numerous diaries, journals, etc.
They relate mainly to but one battle or campaign, and will be mentioned in the following

Introduction, p. 7; <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 1779,
p. 177; and Dawson's <i>Battles</i>, i. 477. Major-General
Augustine Prevost's report is in the
<i>Gazette</i> for Feb. 23, 1779, and <i>Remembrancer</i>, vii.
243. It deals especially with his march from St.
Augustine and capture of Sunbury.<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> An American
account of this latter event is in McCall's

to the Admiralty through the customary
channel, and his report usually follows that of
Prevost, as above. Howe seems to have presented
no formal report, but Lincoln wrote to
Washington (<i>Corresp. Rev.</i>, ii. 244) early in the
next year, describing the disaster. Howe's own
side of the case, however, is fully set forth in
the <i>Proceedings of a General Court-Martial held
at Philadelphia in the State of Penna. by order of
his Excellency General Washington</i>, Phila., 1782;
reprinted in the <i>New York Historical Society's
Collections</i> (1879, pp. 213-311), where will be
found Howe's orders (Dec. 29th,<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> p. 282) and
statement (pp. 285-310). The court, presided
over by Steuben, acquitted Howe on all the
charges "with the highest honor." Nevertheless,
the majority of writers have been unfavorable
to Howe. See especially Moultrie's <i>Memoirs</i>,
i. 244; Lee's <i>Memoirs</i> (2d edition), p. 40;
Ramsay's <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 4. This last is a fairer
view, and is followed by Gordon (<i>American Revolution</i>,
iii. 212). See also Stedman, <i>American
War</i>, ii. 66; McCall's <i>Georgia</i>, ii. 164, and C. C.
Jones's <i>Georgia</i>, ii. 314. In this, the most recent
history of Georgia, all the old statements are
repeated.<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

<p>An American description from a different point
of view is the <i>Account of the Capture of Mordecai
Sheftall, Deputy Commissary of Issues to the Continental

also testified at the court-martial.<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Minor Actions, 1779.</span>&mdash;There is not much
to be found as to Lincoln's doings before the
siege of Savannah except his manuscript "order-books."
Moultrie made an elaborate report
of his encounter near Beaufort.<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a></p>

<p>McCall was present at Kettle Creek, and his
account<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> of Boyd's overthrow has been generally
followed by later writers. No official report
of the affair has been found. The disaster at
Brier Creek was much better chronicled. First
comes Ashe's report to Lincoln (Moultrie, <i>Memoirs</i>,
i. 323, and abridged in Dawson, <i>Battles</i>, i.
492). Lincoln wrote a good account of the affair
(an extract of his letter in Dawson, as above),
and the evidence given at the court-martial<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a>
which tried Ashe is as full as can be desired.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a>
The British accounts do not differ essentially
from these.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a></p>

<p>There is no lack of original material as to
Prevost's unsuccessful attempt on Charleston,<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a>
and Lincoln's attack on Stono. Moultrie made
no formal report, but the documents and bits of
journals scattered through his <i>Memoirs</i> (i. 412-506)
may well take its place. Prevost's report
of his attempt was dated June 12, 1779 (<i>London
Gazette</i>, Sept. 21-25, 1779, reprinted in <i>Remembrancer</i>,
viii. 302). His report as to Stono is in
the <i>Gazette</i>, as above, and also in <i>Remembrancer</i>
viii. 300. Lincoln's version of the latter affair
is contained in a letter to Moultrie (<i>Memoirs</i>, i.
490, and Dawson, i. 501). Moultrie also printed
other letters (cf. especially one from Colonel
Grimkie in <i>Memoirs</i>, i. 495), and an interesting
journal by an unknown hand is in <i>Remembrancer</i>
(viii. 349). Capt. John Henry, who succeeded
Parker, in his reports corroborated Prevost as to
the offer of neutrality on the part of some one
in Charleston (<i>London Gazette</i>, July 10-13, 1779,
and <i>Remembrancer</i> viii. 183). Clinton also has
something to say on the campaign in general in
a report to Germain (<i>Remembrancer</i>, viii. 297).<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln has been criticised for his march into
Georgia, but the movement had the unanimous
support of his generals. Cf. report of the council
of war in Moultrie, i. 374. He supposed
rightly, as we now know (cf. Prevost's report in
<i>Remembrancer</i>, viii. 302), that the British commander's
only object was to compel his return
to South Carolina. Moultrie could have offered
sufficient resistance if one half of his men had
not deserted. Nevertheless, Lincoln was assailed
in the Charleston papers, and complained
bitterly of their unfairness. Cf. letter to Moultrie
in <i>Memoirs</i>, i. 477. With regard to Rutledge's
offer of neutrality, Professor Bowen has
undoubtedly gone too far in describing it as
"little short of treason."<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> Still, if, as Rutledge's
friends claim, the proposition was made merely
to gain time, it was not made in good faith, and
was therefore highly discreditable to the governor.
But there is no evidence that the proposition
was made in any such spirit, except the
statement in Ramsay, which was copied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
Gordon. The truth seems to be that Rutledge,
greatly overestimating the numbers of the enemy,
sought to save his native State from pillage.
He yielded too easily to his fears. Moultrie
takes no pains to conceal his disgust at the offer.
The younger Laurens refused to have anything
to do with the matter, while Gadsden and Ferguson,
two members of the Council, voted against
the proposal, and Edwards, another member,
wept at the thought. Unfortunately, the minutes
of the Council have been lost. Cf. Johnson,
<i>Reply to Bentalou and Sparks</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<p class="pf400">The plans of the siege are mainly English ones. That made by Colonel Moncrieff and published by Faden
is used in Stedman's <i>American War</i>, ii. 79, and is reduced in Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 736. Cf. also C. C.
Jones's <i>Two Journals</i> for a fac-simile (reduced in <i>Hist. of Georgia</i>, vol. ii.) of a <i>Plan of the French and
American Siege of Savannah in Georgia in South America</i> [sic] <i>under Command of the French general
Count d'Estaing</i>. <i>The British commander in the town was General August Prevost, 1779.</i>  It is from Hessian
sources, and resembles Faden's. Also see Moore's <i>Diary of the Amer. Rev.</i>, 1st ed., ii. 221. Carrington
(p. 483) gives an eclectic map. Two contemporary MS. French maps (one measuring 28 × 16 and the other
22 × 22 inches) are in the Boston Public Library (Dufossé, <i>Americana</i>, no. 5,495). There are various MS.
plans of Savannah and the siege among the Peter Force maps, and one in the Faden collection in the library
of Congress. A good map of this region is <i>The Coasts, Rivers, and Inlets of the Province of Georgia; surveyed
by Joseph Avery and others, and published by command of Gov't by J. F. W. Des Barres, 1st Feb.,
1780</i>. Parker did not find his charts correct. <i>Remembrancer</i>, vii. 246.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>It is to be noted that, although there is no
record of the actual presence of Indians at this
siege, their absence was not due to any remissness
on the part of Rutledge, who made every
effort to persuade a band of "eighty Catawbas"
to act with Moultrie. (Cf. the latter's <i>Memoirs</i>,
i. pp. 397, 419, and 453.)</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Siege of Savannah, 1779.</span>&mdash;The best account
of this disastrous siege is the <i>Journal</i>, by
an unknown hand, which Col. C. C. Jones has
translated, with copious notes, in his <i>Siege of Savannah
in 1779 as described in two contemporaneous
journals of French officers in the fleet of Count
D'Estaing</i>, Albany, 1874, pp. 9-52. The other
journal, of which he there gives a partial translation,
is the well-known <i>Extrait du Journal d'un
Officier de la Marine de l'escadre de M. le Comte
D'Estaing, 1782</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> Still another French account
is in the form of an official report,<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> and may
have been the report of the commander himself.
This is by no means certain, though Soulés
(<i>Troublés</i>, iii. 217), in speaking of the numbers
given in this report, says: "Le Comte d'Estaing
dit dans sa relation", etc. This was first printed
in the <i>Paris Gazette</i>, and was reprinted in the
English and American papers of the time.</p>

<p>Prevost made an elaborate report to Germain,
under date of Savannah, Nov. 1, 1779. It was
accompanied by translations of the correspondence
between the commanders, and was first
printed in <i>The London Gazette</i>, Dec. 21-25, 1779.<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a>
Captain John Henry also reported through the
usual channel. He viewed the siege from a
point different from Prevost's, and his report is
therefore of interest.<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> Hough has also reprinted
in his <i>Savannah</i> two "journals" from English
sources.<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> Mention must also be made of a valuable
<i>Memorandum of a very critical period in
the Province of South Carolina</i>, inclosed in a letter
from J. H. Cruger to H. Cruger, etc., dated
Savannah, Nov. 8, 1779, in <i>Magazine of American
History</i>, 1878, p. 489.<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a></p>

<p>Lincoln's report is very meagre (Hough, <i>Savannah</i>,
149). It should be supplemented by <i>An
Account of the Siege of Savannah furnished by
an Officer engaged in the attack, Major Thomas
Pinckney</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> Stevens, the Georgia historian, had
access to Prevost's order-book, and he has
printed in his <i>Georgia</i> (ii. 200, etc.) a few documents
not otherwise accessible. Lincoln's order-book
is still in existence, and his papers were
used by Lee in his valuable account of the affair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
(<i>Memoirs</i>, i. 99). The orders for the assault
have been printed.<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a></p>

<p>Moultrie was not present during the siege, but
he gives a graphic account of the assault (<i>Memoirs</i>,
33-43). It is curious to note his attempt
to defend the militia from the charge of luke-warmness
on the ground that they joined the
army to witness the surrender of the British, not
to take part in a bloody storm. Ramsay was
present at the siege, and his account is good
(<i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 34. See also Gordon, iii. 325,
and Stedman, ii. 121). Captain McCall was
there, too, and his account (<i>Georgia</i>, ii. 240-283)
may be regarded as an original authority. The
local histories<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> are sufficiently detailed for the
general reader, and there are at least two good
French accounts,<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> while the German historians<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
should not be neglected, as there was a "Hessian"
regiment in the town.</p>

<p>D'Estaing has usually been represented as
hurrying on board and sailing away just in time
to avoid a predicted storm. So far was this
from being the case, that, although the assault
was made on the 9th of October, the French
were in front of the town on the 19th and 29th
of the same month. The bulk of the fleet was
blown from the anchorage on the 26th, though
the last frigates did not leave until the 2d of
November.<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> Historians ignoring these facts
have too often praised the prescience of D'Estaing.
The truth seems to be, that, being conscious
of exceeding his instructions and impatient
of delay, the French commander hazarded
everything on an assault, and lost. The delay
in getting away was due for the most part to the
bad discipline which prevailed in the fleet.<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a></p>

<p>This gallant defence made Prevost a major-general,
though he enjoyed his honors for but a
short time, as he died in 1786. Maitland, to
whose timely succor so much was due, died on
the 26th of October from a fever contracted, it
was supposed, during his gallant march to the
aid of the beleaguered town. Cf. Hough, <i>Savannah</i>,
p. 110. The success of the defence was
due mainly to the talents and energy of the engineer
officer, Moncrieff, attached to Prevost's
expedition. No one was more conscious of this
than Prevost, who wrote of him in the warmest
terms in his report to Germain.<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a></p>

<p>The charge of Oct. 9th was fatal to two of the
most romantic characters in our Revolutionary
history, Jasper and Pulaski.<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Charleston, 1780.</span>&mdash;Lincoln presented no
detailed report of his unsuccessful defence of
Charleston, though a short note announcing the
capitulation is in print. Lincoln asked for a
court of inquiry into his conduct.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> But as no
one doubted his integrity or capacity, no court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
was ever held. As to the siege itself, Moultrie
has been the main reliance. His <i>Memoirs</i> (ii.
pp. 65 <i>et seq.</i>) contain the official correspondence
between the opposing commanders, and a diary
or journal running from March 28th to May 12th,
which bears all the marks of a contemporaneous
document. Ramsay, too, was present at the defence,
but his account (<i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 45-62,&mdash;followed
by Gordon, iii. 346) is very meagre.<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a></p>

<p>On the British side, the descriptions in Tarleton
(<i>Campaigns</i>, 4-23) and Stedman (<i>American
War</i>, ii. 176-192) are interesting and detailed.
So far as they relate to events outside of the immediate
vicinity of the city, they are trustworthy;
but neither of these officers was present at the
siege itself.<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> Of more importance than any contemporary
account, with the possible exception
of Moultrie's journal, is the report of Clinton to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
Germain. It is also in the form of a journal,
and runs from March 29th to May 12th, and is
printed as a part of <i>The London Gazette Extra</i>,

<p>The correspondence between Clinton and Germain
with regard to the planning of this campaign
is in the <i>Ninth Report of the Hist. MSS.
Commission</i>, App. iii. pp. 95, 98, etc.<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> In this same
appendix are three letters from Arbuthnot to
Germain, giving interesting details. His official
report was made to Mr. Stevens, secretary of the
Admiralty, and was printed with Clinton's report.
It is especially valuable with regard to the operations
of the fleet. There is a critical account of
the siege in Lee's <i>Memoirs</i>, i. 115-142, and the
more popular descriptions are unusually good,
especially those from German sources.<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Minor Actions, 1780.</span>&mdash;It is to be regretted
that we have no official account of the disaster
at the Waxhaws from the American commander.

<p>Lee says that most of the wounded died of
their wounds. This can hardly be true, as Muhlenberg
in a letter to Washington (Muhlenberg's
<i>Muhlenberg</i>, 368) says that the prisoners taken
at the Waxhaws have nearly all returned. There
are no plans of the battle, and it has been found
impossible to make any estimate of the numbers
engaged.<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a></p>

<p class="pf400">There is a contemporary English map: <i>Environs of Charleston, S. C. Published June 1, 1780</i>. <i>By Capt.
George Sproule, Assistant Engineer on the spot</i>; and a MS. <i>Sketch of the coast from South Edisto to
Charlestown, 1 March, 1780</i>,&mdash;showing, among other things, "the rebel redoubt" at Stono. The best plan
of the siege itself is <i>A Sketch of the operations before Charleston, the Capital of South Carolina</i>. <i>Published
17th of June, 1780, according to Act of Parliament, by I. F. W. Des Barres, Eng.</i> It will be noticed that
this was put forth two days after Clinton's despatch of May 14th was published in London. It is a large map,
showing the positions in colors. There are two copies in the Harvard College library. It has been reprinted
by Mayor Courtenay in the <i>Charleston Year-Book for 1882</i>, P. 360, as "Sir Henry Clinton's Map, 1780", with
a description (p. 371). Some one has apparently attempted to remove the inscription referred to above, and
only the words "of June, 1780" are legible. In other respects it is identical with the Des Barres map. In his
<i>Year-Book</i> (1880, p. 264) Mayor Courtenay has reproduced an interesting <i>Plan of Charlestown</i>. <i>With its
Entrenchments and those made by the English, 1780.</i> It relates only to the lines themselves, and was probably
the work of an American. There is a good map, with lines in colors, in Faden's <i>Plans of Battles</i>,
which is reproduced in Tarleton, p. 32, and Stedman, ii. 184, Ramsay (<i>Rev. S. C.</i>, ii. 59) gives an excellent
map of a later date, as does Gordon (iii. 358). See also Lossing, <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 765; Marshall's <i>Washington</i>,
atlas no. 10; Moore's <i>Diary</i>, ii. 258; Carrington's <i>Battles</i>, p. 498; <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, 1883, p. 827; and
R. E. Lee's edition of Lee's <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 146. Mention should also be made of a MS. plan in the Faden coll.,
and of a map, apparently of French origin, the property of Daniel Ravenal, of Charleston (<i>Charleston Year-Book</i>,
1884, p. 295), which Mr. De Saussure regards as a copy of "Brigadier-General Du Portail's engineer's
map;" but there seems to be no evidence of this in print. There is a good chart of Charleston harbor in the
corner of Des Barres's map, and in the so-called <i>Mouzon Map</i> (1775), while Ramsay (<i>Rev. S. C.</i>, ii. 52) has a
<i>Sketch of Charleston Harbour, showing the disposition of the British fleet under the command of Vice-Admiral
Mariot Arbuthnot in the attack on Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island in 1780</i>.</p>

<p class="pf400">Attempts at the identification of localities have been made by W. G. De Saussure in <i>Charleston Year-Book</i>
(1884, pp. 282-308), and in an <i>Historical Map of Charleston, 1670-1883</i>, in the <i>Year-Book</i> for 1883. A
plan of Fort Johnson on James' Island is in <i>Ibid.</i> (p. 473). These latter maps are also in a reprint of a portion
of this <i>Year-Book</i>, issued under the title of <i>1670-1783: The Centennial of Incorporation, 1883</i> (Charleston,

<p>For the period between the Waxhaws and the
disaster near Camden, the reports of Cornwallis
are of value (<i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 261; <i>Pol. Mag.</i>,
i. 261, etc.); Ramsay, <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 128-145,
has a fair account. The affair at Ramsour's
Mill has not been given due prominence in the
general histories. There is a good account of
it in Caldwell's <i>Greene</i>, 123. But the description
which has generally been followed is the one
which General Joseph Graham&mdash;who was not
present at the fight&mdash;printed in the <i>Catawba
Journal</i> for Feb. 1, 1825.<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a></p>

<p>Colonel Williams transmitted a report of the
action at Musgrove's Mill to Gates (<i>Remembrancer</i>,
xi. 87). But the best account of the
affair is in Draper's <i>King's Mountain</i>, who (p.
122) gives a list of his authorities. See especially
MCCall, <i>Georgia</i>, ii. 304-317; Jones, <i>Georgia</i>, ii.
452; and <i>Amer. Whig Rev.</i>, new series, ii. 578.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Gates's Defeat near Camden, 1780.</span>&mdash;The
defeated general dated his official report
at Hillsborough, Aug. 20, 1780 (<i>Remembrancer</i>,
x. 335; Tarleton, 145; <i>Sparks's Correspondence
of the Revolution</i>, iii. 66 and 76; <i>Mag. Amer.
Hist.</i>, v. 502, etc.). Cornwallis presented two reports
bearing on the campaign. In the first&mdash;sometimes
dated Aug. 20th, and sometimes Aug.
21st&mdash;he follows his movement to his arrival at
Camden. The second&mdash;always dated the 21st&mdash;takes
up the story at that point. They are
both in the <i>London Gazette Extra</i> for October
9th, 1780.<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a></p>

<p>I have found nothing official from Rawdon;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
but on Sept. 19th, 1780, he wrote to his mother,
the Countess of Moira, describing the events
preceding the battle. He speaks of the course
taken by Gates as "the ruinous part which they,
the Americans, actually did embrace", adding
that De Kalb had advised Gates to cross Lynch's
Creek and attack him there. This Rawdon
learned from an aide to De Kalb<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a>&mdash;probably
Du Buysson&mdash;who was taken with his chief.<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a></p>

<p>Tarleton, too, was a participator in the action,
and his account (<i>Campaigns</i>, 85-110), though
written long after the event, is valuable. It begins
with Cornwallis's arrival at Camden.</p>

<p>But the description of the campaign and battle
which far outweighs all others, is the <i>Narrative
of the Campaign of 1780, by Colonel Otho
Holland Williams, Adjutant-general</i>,&mdash;printed
as "Appendix B" to Johnson's <i>Greene</i>, vol. i.
pp. 465-510, and copied thence into Simms's
<i>Greene</i>, Appendix. There is no reason to doubt
the general accuracy of the story, though no one
knows when Williams wrote it. Two of the
American commander's aides wrote accounts.
The more important is the letter from Thomas
Pinckney to William Johnson, the biographer
of Greene, dated Clermont, July, 1822, and therefore
written long after the battle; but the author's
recollections so exactly agree with the
facts as now known that it is an account of the
greatest value.<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a></p>

<p>The other is Major McGill's letter to his
father, written within eight miles of the scene
of action.<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a></p>

<p>McGill carried Gates's despatches to Jefferson,
then governor of Virginia, and gave him an account
of the battle, which formed part of a statement
"of this unlucky affair, taken from letters
from General Gates, General Stevens, and Governor
Nash, and, as to some circumstances, from
an officer [McGill] who was in the action."<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a></p>

<p>Still another excellent narrative of the campaign
is in <i>A Journal of the Southern Expedition,
1780-83. By William Seymour</i> (<i>Penna.
Mag. of Hist.</i>, vii. 286, 377), who was sergeant-major
of the Delaware regiment. The journal
begins at Petersburg, May 26, 1780, thus describing
the whole movement.</p>

<p>There are numerous descriptions by persons
who, though not actually present at the disaster,
yet enjoyed exceptionally good advantages for
obtaining correct information.<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a></p>

<p>Of the earlier historians, Gordon (<i>History</i>, iii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
391 and 429) enjoyed the best advantages. He
visited Gates in 1781 and used his papers. These
MSS. had disappeared until a few years ago,
when Dr. T. A. Emmet, whose grandfather
was Gates's counsellor, found them in a garret.
(Cf. <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, v. 241.) A portion of this
collection was printed in <i>Ibid.</i> v. 281; as to the
value of those reserved I have been able to
learn nothing. A large part of the papers printed
consists merely of the orders issued during the
campaign. The most important of these&mdash;technically
termed "after-orders", giving the order
for the movement which brought on the action&mdash;have
been printed over and over again.<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a></p>

<p>We have no detailed account of Sumter's
attempt to injure the enemy, nor of his overthrow
at Fishdam Ford, except that in Tarleton's
<i>Campaigns</i>, 110-116. As may be imagined,
Tarleton gave his own side of the case more
than due prominence. Lee, in his <i>Memoirs</i>
(i. 187), gives a good account. He adds that
"Tarleton evinced a temerity which could not,
if pursued, long escape exemplary chastisement."
There is something in Stedman, ii. 211,
and in Ramsay, <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 152. The accounts
in the more popular books are so inaccurate
that no mention of them is required.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a></p>

       <p class="pf400">The movements as detailed in a plan by Colonel Senff, preserved among the <i>Steuben Papers</i> (N. Y. Hist.
Soc.), are shown in this sketch after a cut in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i> (1880), vol. v. p. 275. The plan and
accompanying journal, taken from the Steuben Papers, are in the Sparks MSS., no. xv. A marsh and the river
were on the American right and the British left. The road to Camden is marked by parallel lines. The
American right, 400 Marylanders under General Gist, were between the road and the low ground at 1, with two
cannon on their right at 2, and two others on the left in the road at 3. Beyond the road were three brigades of
North Carolina militia (4, 4, 4), under Brigadiers Rutherford, Graigery, and Butler, with two field-pieces at 5,
on their left. Beyond this the American line was completed by 700 Virginia militia under Brigadier Stevens
(6), and 300 light infantry under Colonel Potterfield (7). Colonel Armand, with 60 horse, was in the rear (8)
of this part of the line, and as a reserve Smallwood with the first Maryland brigade of about 400 men, was
across the road at 9. [The names are given as in the sketch.]</p>

<p class="pf400">On the British side the first troops to appear were at 10 with a field-piece, and their main body formed at 11.
The American troops at 6 and 7 advanced to 12, and were met by the British (11) moving by their right flank
and then advancing to 13. The American reserve (9) then moved to 12 to support the left wing, while the
right wing (1) advanced to 12 and engaged the British left (13). The Americans at 4, 4, 4, and 12 (opposite 6
and 7) now broke and fled. At this opportune moment the British cavalry (14) charged along the line shown
by small crosses, and turning to the right and left took in reverse the Americans at 1, and the reserve (9) in
their new position at 12. The whole American army scattered in retreat before the British advance.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>With regard to the treatment of those captured
at Savannah and Charleston, Southern writers
do not seem to have strictly adhered to the
truth. Those captured by Campbell were protected
by no treaty of capitulation; and as to
those taken at Charleston, the charges of Moultrie
and others were always denied.<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a></p>

<p>Isaac Hayne, at the time of the surrender of
Charleston, was a colonel in a militia regiment,
but, being in the country, he was not included
in the capitulation. His wife and two children
were ill with the small-pox, and it was impossible
to take them to a place of refuge. He
went to Charleston and offered to give his parole
as a prisoner of war. He was told that he must
take the oath of allegiance or be confined as a
rebel. It was a hard position, and, thinking of
his wife dying at home, he took the oath; not,
however, until he had called Ramsay (<i>Rev. in
S. C.</i>) to bear witness that he was forced to it
by necessity. He retired to his farm, and lived
there unmolested until the success of the American
arms once more brought his friends around
him. Then he was told by the British leaders
that he must arm on the king's side or go to
prison. He regarded this as a violation of his
agreement, and enlisted under Pickens. He
commanded a regiment of militia drawn from
the neighborhood, and composed of men who
believed with him that when protection was
withdrawn the duty of allegiance went with it.
Soon after this he captured, not many miles
from Charleston, Williamson, a noted renegade,
who was regarded by his former friends as the
"Arnold of the South." On his way back Hayne
was captured, taken to Charleston, and hanged.<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a>
The fact that Greene and Marion (Gibbes, <i>Doc.
Hist.</i>, i. 125) both regarded it as calling for retaliation<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a>
goes a great way towards showing that
Rawdon and Balfour acted harshly and precipitately
in the matter; but the case is an admirable
example of the light in which Cornwallis&mdash;for
Balfour tried to justify his conduct
by a reference to the letter or order issued by
Cornwallis after Camden&mdash;persisted in regarding
those who fought for their country and their
rights. It seems to me, however, that Cornwallis's
position was a false one; and to assert, as
Balfour asserted, that South Carolina was completely
conquered in 1780, was to assert what
was not true. Rawdon sailed for home soon
after this affair. He was captured by the French,
and did not reach London until after Yorktown.
He was immediately assailed in the House of
Peers by the Duke of Richmond for his share
in this business. In reply he challenged the
noble duke, and the upshot was that Richmond
apologized.<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> Many years later, Lee sent Rawdon
a copy of his <i>Memoirs</i>, in which Hayne is
warmly defended. Rawdon, then Earl of Moira,
wrote a long letter (June 24, 1813) in reply, but
his defence does not appear to be sound.<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> It
should be said, in justification of the light in
which Hayne was regarded by the British officers
at the time, that they believed he had taken a
second oath to the king just before his capture
in arms; but this does not appear to have been
the case.<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a></p>

<p>The most aggravated case of murder on the
American side was the shooting of the Tory Col.

declared that the murderer was not known.<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">King's Mountain.</span>&mdash;There is very little
original material in print bearing on Clarke's
siege of Augusta. McCall's narrative (<i>Georgia</i>,
ii. 321) has been very generally followed. An
anonymous account from a British source is in
the <i>Remembrancer</i>, xi. 28.</p>

<p>Lyman C. Draper,<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> in his <i>King's Mountain
and its Heroes</i>, gives nearly all the important
documents relating to that action. Unfortunately,
as its title indicates, there is too much
hero worship<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> in the volume, and Draper's own
account is based too largely on tradition to be
wholly trustworthy, and is too diffuse and intricate.
As a repository of documents, however,
the volume is of the first importance. I shall
attempt only a summary of the documents bearing
on the movement.</p>

<p>Shelby wrote to his father five days after the
fight (Draper, 302), and later, on October 26th,
to Col. Arthur Campbell (Draper, 524). The
statements in the first letter as to losses, etc., are
strangely at variance with those contained in an
official report signed by Campbell, Shelby, and
Cleveland on October 20th.<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> Col. William Campbell
also wrote to Arthur Campbell on the same
day (Draper, 526; Gibbes, p. 140, and elsewhere).
Draper gives several other accounts, the most
important being "Battle of King's Mountain",
probably written by Robert Campbell, "an ensign
in Dysart's corps" (Draper, 537, from MS.
in possession of the Tenn. Hist. Soc.). Gen.
Joseph Graham, who had no part in the fight,
being still confined in the hospital from the
wound received at the defence of Charlotte,
wrote a description.<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> David Campbell, in a
letter (Foote's <i>Sketches of Virginia</i>, 2d series,
p. 126) dated Montcalm, Dec. 1, 1851,<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> defended
his ancestor. Still other accounts are in Draper,
many of them reprints; and a letter from
Iredell to his wife, dated Granville, Oct. 8, 1780
(McRee's <i>Iredell</i>, i. 463), should not be overlooked.</p>

<p>The most interesting description of the campaign
from the British side is in the <i>Diary
of Anthony Allaire</i>, of Ferguson's corps.<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> The
chronology is useful in fixing dates, and his
narrative of his treatment while in captivity
and during his successful attempt to escape is
very interesting. He is also supposed to have
been the author of a letter written by "an officer
from Charleston, Jan. 30", which is printed in
Rivington's <i>Royal Gazette</i> of Feb. 14, 1781, and
reprinted in Draper, 516.<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a></p>

<p>There are two interesting letters from Rawdon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
showing the extent of the disaffection to
the royalist cause in the Carolinas.<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a></p>

<p>Cornwallis seems to have presented no detailed
report; at least, none has been printed,
to my knowledge. There are allusions to the
affair which show how deeply he was impressed
by the coming of the men from beyond the
mountains. The effect it had upon the plans
of the British can be learned from a letter from
Germain to Clinton, dated Jan. 3, 1781, in which
he regrets that Ferguson's defeat compelled
Cornwallis to require Leslie to quit the Chesapeake.<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a></p>

<p>There is also an anonymous memoir of
A Carolina Loyalist in the Revolutionary War
in Chesney's <i>Essays in Modern Military Biography</i>
(London, 1874, pp. 461-468), which contains
something of interest.</p>

<p>[The latest contribution to the story of the
parts played by John Sevier, Isaac Shelby, and
James Robertson in helping to work the discomfiture
of the British in the Southern colonies is
the <i>Rear Guard of the Revolution by Edmund
Kirke</i> [J. R. Gilmore], N. Y., 1886. The author
says "his materials were principally gathered
from old settlers in East Tennessee and Western
North Carolina, one of whom was the son of
a trusted friend of Sevier, Dr. J. G. M. Ramsey
of Knoxville, the author of the <i>Annals of Tennessee</i>,
who in his youth had known Sevier and
Robertson, and who was nearly ninety years old
when he was questioned by Gilmore."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Minor Actions</span>, 1780.&mdash;The library of the
Massachusetts Historical Society contains an
original account of Weemys's unfortunate night
attack on Sumter's camp at Fishdam Ford, from
the pen of the British commander. It should
not be followed too closely, as it was not written
until many years of peace and poverty had
clouded Weemys's judgment and memory. A
more trustworthy description is in a letter from
Sumter to Smallwood, written on the field of
battle, Nov. 9, 1780 (<i>Maryland Papers</i>, p. 122).
It is to be regretted that no letter of his relating
to the affair at the Blackstocks has been
preserved; for the British accounts are very
confusing, Tarleton even claiming the victory
(<i>Campaigns</i>, p. 178). This he did on the strength
of a despatch from Cornwallis to Clinton, dated
at Wynnesborough, Dec. 3, 1781.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> This, in its
turn, as Mackenzie points out (<i>Strictures</i>, p. 71),
was based&mdash;so far as it relates to the affair at
the Blackstocks&mdash;on Tarleton's own report. In
fact, Tarleton was beaten at that time. Mackenzie
does not seem to have been present in person,
but his account was based on the declarations
of witnesses. It is the best description of
the fight that we have, and has been followed
by later writers, notably by Stedman (ii. 226-231).
The only account that we have from an
American source was written by Col. Samuel
Hammond, who was present, as he was at the
Cowpens (Johnson's <i>Traditions</i>, pp. 507, 522).
It should not be too closely followed. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
are a few reports and letters written by Cornwallis,
and by Rawdon during his chief's illness,
relating to this period, that should not be
overlooked.<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Greene's Campaign in General.</span>&mdash;The
standard authorities relating to Greene's campaign
have already been mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> Lee was
Greene's most trusted adviser, but there were
others also deep in his confidence, such as
Morgan, O. H. Williams,<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> William Washington,<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a>
Carrington,<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> Howard,<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> and W.

Greene also utilized the services of the partisans
Marion, Sumter, Pickens, and the rest.
There is a noted passage bearing on the proper
method of treating these men in one of Greene's
letters to Morgan before the affair at the Cowpens.
It seems that Morgan had complained
of Sumter's order to his subordinates to obey
no commands unless conveyed through him.
Greene replied to Morgan: "As it is better to
conciliate than aggravate matters, where everything
depends so much upon voluntary principles,
I wish you to take no notice of the matter,
but endeavor to influence his conduct to
give you all the aid in his power." It was by
pursuing such a course that Greene secured the
coöperation of all men in the South.</p>

<p>A good knowledge of the scene of operations
is indispensable to a thorough understanding of
Greene's remarkable campaigns. The general
direction of the rivers should be especially noted,
as upon it the success of a particular movement
often turned.<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Cowpens.</span>&mdash;Morgan's official report
(Jan. 19) to Greene and Greene's instructions
to Morgan (Charlotte, December 16, 1780) are
in Graham, pp. 260, 467, while from that point
and date the whole campaign can be traced by
the letters printed by Graham.<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a></p>

<p>A letter from Tarleton to Morgan dated on
the 19th, two days after the battle, and relating
to prisoners and wounded, is in <i>The Charleston
News and Courier</i>. I have nowhere found a formal
report by Tarleton. His description of the
fight, at the time, is undoubtedly embodied in
Cornwallis's report to Germain, dated Turkey
Creek, Broad River, Jan. 18, 1781.<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a></p>

<p>At a later day Tarleton wrote out an account
(<i>Campaigns</i>, pp. 213-223). Seldom has a commander
written a more unfair account of his
defeat. Not merely that he is unjust to Morgan,
but he is also very unjust to his own men. A
much better description, by a British eye-witness,
is Mackenzie's (<i>Strictures</i>, 95, followed by Stedman,
<i>Amer. War</i>, ii. 316-325). Indeed, this last
is in some respects the best account that we
have. A narrative from "Colonel Samuel Hammond"
(Johnson's <i>Traditions</i>, pp. 526-530) is
not trustworthy.<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a></p>

<p>Cornwallis made a formal report to Germain,
dated Guilford, March 17, 1781.<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> Balfour in an
independent report to Clinton (<i>Remembrancer</i>,
xi. 330, and <i>Polit. Mag.</i>, ii. 328), gave a somewhat
similar account of the operations; but the
most important document that has yet been
printed is Cornwallis's <i>Order-book</i>, covering this
period. It opens with an order of January 18,
1781, and runs with scarcely a break to March
20th. It was used by Graham in his preparation
of the <i>Life of Morgan</i>, but was not generally
accessible until some years later, when Caruthers
printed it as the appendix to the second
volume of his <i>Incidents</i>. Caruthers' own account
of the movement (<i>Incidents</i>, pp. 13-67),
although weighted with personal reminiscences,
is still the best single narrative.<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a></p>

<p>Tarleton's description (<i>Campaigns</i>, 222) of the
march is far from satisfactory, and should be
supplemented by that of the less partial Stedman
(<i>Amer. War</i>, ii. 325) and Gordon (iv. 37).<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a></p>

<p>The only action of this retreat that deserves
special mention is the very gallant charge of the
Guards at Cowan's Ford over the Catawba. It
was especially creditable to the Grenadiers, and
has received far less attention at the hands of
American writers than it deserves. A good account
is in Hamilton's <i>Grenadier Guards</i>, ii.
243,<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> and Stedman has devoted considerable
space to it. On the other hand, it should be
said that the description in Tarleton cannot be
reconciled with known facts, and deserves no
credit.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Guilford Campaign.</span>&mdash;Lee's description

<p>Col. O. H. Williams also wrote an interesting

wife), dated Camp before Camden, April 27,
1781 (Potter's <i>American Monthly</i>, iv. 101, and
Tiffany's <i>Williams</i>, p. 19). Still another of
Greene's officers&mdash;Major William Pierce&mdash;in
a letter (August 20) devoted considerable space
to this indecisive engagement (<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>,
vii. 431-435). A somewhat different description
by a looker-on was written many years afterwards
by Samuel Matthis, an inhabitant of the
district. It is entitled: <i>Account of the battle of
Hobkirk's Hill as some call it, or Battle of Camden
as called by others, tho' the ground on which
it was fought is now (1810) called the Big Sand

<p>Whether Greene was or was not surprised is
the only point about which there has been much
dispute in recent years. Johnson (<i>Greene</i>, ii.
72) has effectually disposed of this question in
Greene's favor; but it must be admitted that he
was "very suddenly attacked", to use the words
of Lee, who was not present at the battle, and
who seems to have forgotten the exact relation of
events of this campaign. The account of this
affair in the lives of Greene by Johnson and
Greene (iii. 241), as well as that in Marshall's
<i>Washington</i> (iv. 510), is based upon an unpublished
narrative by Colonel Davie, which is

<p><span class="smcap">The Capture of the Posts.</span>&mdash;For the account
of the capture of Fort Watson, Marion's
report (April 23) to Greene has been the main
reliance (Simms, <i>Marion</i>, p. 231; <i>Pol. Mag.</i>, ii.
548; <i>Remembrancer</i>, xii. 127, etc.). Lee's narrative
of this period (<i>Memoirs</i>, ii. 50) is detailed,
but it was written too long after the war to be
accurate. This is unfortunate, as we have no
other account of the taking of Fort Motte (<i>Memoirs</i>,
ii. 73) by an on-looker, unless we accept
the letter sent by Greene to Congress as an
original source. It is not known when Greene
arrived at Fort Motte, which was at some time
before the surrender.<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a></p>

becomes useful.<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> Another description, though
from what source is not stated, is in Johnson's

ii. 81-95 and 100-118. The first part
refers more especially to the capture of Fort
Granby and of Fort Galphin, an outpost of Augusta.

and Pickens on one side and Brown on the other

no formal report of his defence&mdash;so far as I

in Mackenzie's <i>Strictures</i>, pp. 139-164, written
by Lieutenant Hatton, of the New Jersey Loyalist

is very severe on Tarleton's account (<i>Campaigns</i>,
495). Greene's very meagre report is dated Little
River, June 20, 1781 (Caldwell's <i>Greene</i>; <i>Pol.

<p>Neither Greene nor Lee (<i>Memoirs</i>, ii. 119)
intimate that the stockaded fort was abandoned
before Lee's assault, though the English authorities
assert it. Nor does Greene allude to the
gallant sally of the defenders of the "Star",<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
which compelled the assailants to retire from
the ditch, with great loss to themselves.<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a></p>

<p>Williams has left two accounts: the first is a
letter, dated Fort Motte, Sept., 1781 (Tiffany's
<i>Williams</i>, p. 22). The important paper, however,
is entitled: <i>Account furnished by Colonel
Otho Williams, with additions by Cols. W.
Hampton, Polk, Howard, and Watt</i> (when written
is not stated), in Gibbes (pp. 144-157). It is
a long and detailed description of the battle by
men who actually took part, but as it may have
been written long after the event, too much reliance
should not be placed upon it. Still another
description of the campaign, though not
of the battle, is contained in two letters from
Major William Pierce to St. George Tucker
(<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, vii. 435). Lieutenant-Colonel
Stuart presented a report to Cornwallis, which
has been widely reprinted.<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a></p>

<p>It differs from the American accounts in many
particulars, especially as to the disorganization
of his own troops, which very likely has been
described in too glowing colors by American
writers. Lee was present at the battle, but his
description (<i>Memoirs</i>, ii. 276-301) of the contest
is sometimes hard to reconcile with the accounts
of his fellow-soldiers. Greene, according to Williams,
was hardly satisfied with the conduct of
that partisan leader, and Lee soon after retired
from the army, ostensibly for other reasons.
Neither Johnson (<i>Greene</i>, ii. 219) nor G. W.
Greene (<i>Greene</i>, iii. 384) have added much to
our knowledge of this action, and the same may
be said of the other writers on the war.<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Greene's Later Campaigns.</span>&mdash;There are
many letters of this period in the third volume
of Sparks's <i>Correspondence of the Revolution</i>,
and in Gibbes's <i>Documentary History</i> (1781-1782).
Many of those in the latter are of merely
local interest, a large number of them relating
more especially to a quarrel between Horry and
Mahem, Marion's two subordinates. Lee, too,
after his return from Yorktown became discontented,
and many letters which passed between
him and his commander are printed by
Gibbes. Much of Lee's uneasiness was doubtless
due to the prominence which Greene
awarded to Laurens. Leslie's letter proposing
a cessation of hostilities was enclosed by Greene
in a letter to the President of Congress (<i>Remembrancer</i>,
xiv. 324). A truce not being acceded
to, he demanded provisions (<i>Remembrancer</i>,
xv. 28). This too being refused, he endeavored
to seize them. One of the expeditions
resulted in the death of Laurens.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> Gist made

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Lafayette and Cornwallis in Virginia.</span>&mdash;Lafayette,

from Cornwallis at this time will be found
in his <i>Correspondence</i> (i. 105 <i>et seq.</i>). Tarleton
(<i>Campaigns</i>, 279) gives a good account of the
march from Guilford to Wilmington and thence
to Petersburg, from his point of view. Gen.
Graham was at that time a captain in the 76th
regiment, which, with the 80th, bore the brunt
of the action at the crossing of the James. The
account of the affair in his <i>Memoirs</i> (pp. 53-55)
is one of the best we have. Simcoe, in his <i>Journal</i>
(ed. 1787, pp. 146-177; Am. ed., pp. 209-250),
has given a detailed description of the campaign.
He has exaggerated his own services,
but has atoned, in part, for this by giving a set
of good plans of the rencounters which he tried
to dignify into battles.<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> Giradin (<i>Continuation

<p>This gallant struggle of Lafayette against
great odds was very creditable to him and to
his soldiers; but it had little or no influence on
the final result. Nevertheless, it has attracted
the attention of recent writers, and has brought
out two good articles: one from the pen of Carrington
(<i>Mag. Am. Hist.</i>, vi. 340, with map), the
other from a less known writer, Mr. Coleman
(<i>Ibid.</i> vii. 201).<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The Yorktown Campaign.</span>&mdash;Clinton and
Cornwallis, in their pamphlets on the conduct of
the campaign, printed most of the important
documents which passed between them and
their superiors and subordinates. Others will
be found in the documents printed by order of
the Lords, and still others in the biographies
of the different commanders. I shall point out
only the most important. In a letter (Wilmington,
April 18, 1781) Cornwallis explained the
reasons for the Guilford campaign, gave an account
of his later movements, and advocated a
march into Virginia. On the 24th he wrote to
Phillips that his situation at Wilmington was
very distressing (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>, xxv. 155, etc.). On
the preceding day he had announced his determination
to Germain to go north (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>,
xxv. 145; extracts in numerous places, among
others in Tarleton, 325). But more valuable
than these are two letters to Clinton written
April 24th (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>, xxv. 156; extracts in
Cornwallis's <i>Correspondence</i>, i. 94; Cornwallis's
<i>Answer</i>, p. 55; and in many other places). Clinton
disapproved this movement from the outset.
(Cf. letter, May 29th, in Clinton's <i>Observations
on Cornwallis</i>, App. p. 99.) Cornwallis tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
justify his conduct in a letter dated Portsmouth,
July 24th (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>, xxv. 207, etc.). On the
other hand, Germain was "well pleased to find
Cornwallis's opinion entirely coincided" with
his (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>, xxv. 135). Cornwallis therefore
went north without any misgivings.<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a></p>

<p>On June 11th Clinton ordered Cornwallis to
seek some defensive position (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>, xxv.
160). Four days later he wrote that he should
need some of Cornwallis's troops (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>,
xxv. 175, and Cornwallis's <i>Answer</i>, App. p. 112).
This request he repeated on the 19th, and
again on the 26th (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>, xxv. 177, and
<i>Germain Corresp.</i>, 187). In this last he announced
his purpose of marching on Philadelphia.
On the 30th Cornwallis wrote one or two
letters questioning the utility of the defensive
post he was ordered to occupy (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>,
xxv. 169, and at greater length in Cornwallis's
<i>Answer</i>, App. p. 118). In another letter, dated
July 8th, he again questioned the utility of a defensive
post. Clinton on his part, in two letters
of July 8th and 11th, censured the Virginia commander
for repassing the James, and ordered
him to occupy Old Point Comfort (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>,
xxv. 171). Again, in another letter of the same
date as the second of these, he reiterates his
order to fortify a station in the Chesapeake for
the protection of large ships. Admiral Graves
also wrote to Cornwallis, urging him to seize and
fortify Old Point Comfort (Cornwallis's <i>Answer</i>,
App. p. 180). A board of officers was now sent
to report on the practicability of holding Old
Point Comfort as a station for line-of-battle
ships. They reported (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>, xxv. 182)
that the proposed site was not suitable, and this
decision Cornwallis communicated to Graves
(Aug. 26th, in the App. to his <i>Answer</i>). He
also wrote to Clinton on the next day somewhat
bitterly in regard to his criticisms and orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
(<i>Corn. Corresp.</i>, i. 107). Thinking that his orders
required him to fortify Yorktown, he repaired
thither, though writing to O'Hara that the position
was a bad one on account of the heat, etc.
(<i>Corn. Corresp.</i>, i. III.). Clinton also wrote
three letters at about this time, which Cornwallis
did not receive until after his surrender. The
first and important one is in <i>Parl. Reg.</i>, xxv. 182,
while all three are in the Appendix to Cornwallis's
<i>Answer</i>, pp. 237, 251, 257. Such are the
most important documents bearing on the responsibility<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a>
for the disaster at Yorktown.</p>

<p>Cornwallis's official report to Clinton (Yorktown,
Oct. 20, 1781) was forwarded by Clinton
to Germain on Nov. 15, 1781.<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> The two commanders
kept up a constant correspondence
during the siege, and from their letters the details
may be gathered. These are all printed in
the Appendix to the <i>Parliamentary Register</i> and
in numerous other places.</p>

<p>As soon as it was known at New York that
Cornwallis was besieged by such superior numbers,
every effort was made to relieve him.<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a>
The fleet had been so badly cut up during the
recent encounter with De Grasse that Graves
refused to venture again to sea before extensive
repairs had been completed. Consequently,
when the relieving fleet arrived off the capes of
the Chesapeake the capitulation of Yorktown
had been signed. The letters and reports relating
to this abortive endeavor will be found in
the <i>Parl. Reg.</i>, xxv. pp. 190-200. There seems to
be no reason to blame Clinton or Graves for
this delay.<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a></p>

siege.<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> On Oct. 29th Clinton wrote to Germain
the first official news concerning the surrender.
This letter (<i>London Gazette</i>, Nov. 24-27, 1781,
and <i>Remembrancer</i>, xiii. 33) is marked as received
on Nov. 27th; but Wraxall, in a well-known
passage, says that the first official news
of the surrender was received on the 25th.<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Ninth Rep. of the Hist. MSS. Commission</i>
(App. iii. pp. 112-114) contains four letters from
"G. Damer" to Lord George Germain, relating
to the Virginia campaigns from Phillips's expedition
to the end. These letters are of exceeding
value and interest. They bear out the assertion
so often made in the preceding narrative
as to the great want of harmony which prevailed
in the higher ranks of the British forces in this
country.</p>

surrender (<i>Remembrancer</i>, xiii. 60, and innumerable

than his order-book and his journal (May to
Nov., 1781), which last is in the State Department
at Washington (T. F. Dwight in <i>Mag. Am.

        <p class="pf400"><span class="smcap">Note on the Maps of the Yorktown Campaign.</span>&mdash;There is among the Rochambeau maps the
original sketch, done with a pen and a wash, 40×12 inches, showing the different encampments of the French
army between Boston and Yorktown, which is etched in Soulés' <i>Histoire des Troubles de l'Amérique Anglaise</i>,
and reproduced in Balch's <i>Les Français en Amérique</i>, and in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, v. p. 1, and vii.
pp. 8, 12, 17.</p>

<p class="pf400"><i>The route of the allies from Chatham to Head of Elk, by Lieutenant Hills</i>, a British map, is in <i>Mag. of
Amer. Hist.</i>, v. 16. Cf., for a general view, <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, lxiii. p. 328. The best account of this march and
the return to Boston is by J. A. Stevens in <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, iii. 393; iv. 1; v. 1; vii. 1.</p>

<p class="pf400">The earliest American map of the siege is one by Sebastian Bauman, an officer of German extraction attached
to Lamb's artillery, whose draft was engraved in Philadelphia in 1782. There are copies in the N. Y. and
Penna. Hist. Societies, and, reduced one half, it is given in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i> (vol. vi. 57), and it is also
in Johnston's <i>Yorktown</i>, p. 198. There is among the Rochambeau maps in the library of Congress (no. 63)
a <i>Plan of the investment of York and Gloucester by Sebastian Bauman</i>; the French in yellow, the Americans
in blue, and the English in red.</p>

<p class="pf400">The earliest American maps issued to accompany narratives were Ramsay's in his <i>Rev. in So. Carolina</i>, ii.
545 (reproduced herewith, and followed in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, lxiii. 333, and Lowell's <i>Hessians</i>, 278); Gordon's,
in his vol. iv. 196, also follows Bauman; Marshall's, in his <i>Atlas</i> to his <i>Washington</i> (reproduced herewith).
Later published are the maps in Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, viii. 186; in Atlas to Guizot's <i>Washington</i>; in Irving's
<i>Washington</i>, quarto ed., iv. 356; E. M. Stone's <i>Our French Allies</i>, 424; Carrington's <i>Battles</i>, 646;
Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 518; Ridpath's <i>United States</i>; J. A. Stevens's <i>Yorktown Centennial Handbook</i>;
Johnston's <i>Yorktown</i> (pp. 133, 144).</p>

<p class="pf400">The leading British map of the siege is <i>A Plan of Yorktown and Gloucester ... from an actual survey
in the possession of Jno. Hills, late lieut. in the 23d Regiment</i> (Faden, London, Oct. 7, 1785). There is another
dated March 1, 1787, and, though a different plate, it corresponds nearly to the one in Stedman, ii. 412,
which is reproduced in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, vi. p. 8; Tarleton's <i>Campaigns</i>, ch. vii.; R. E. Lee's ed. of
Henry Lee's <i>Memoirs</i>, etc., p. 300; Hamilton, <i>Repub. of the U. S.</i>, ii. 263. Other early English maps are: <i>A
Plan of the Posts of York and Gloucester in the Province of Virginia, established by his Majesty's Army,
etc., which terminated in the Surrender ... on the 17th Oct., 1781. Surveyed by Capt. Fage of the Royal
Artillery</i>, which contains a small plan showing the position of the army between the ravines. What appears to
be an original map is the <i>Plan of York Town shewing the Batteries and Approaches of the French and Americans,
1781</i>, on p. 61 of the <i>Memoir of General Graham</i>. A large map in colors is: <i>Plan of York Town in
Virginia and adjacent country exhibiting the operations of the American, French, and English armies
during the siege of that place in Oct. 1781</i>, by J. F. Renault. Leake's <i>Lamb</i>, p. 278, contains a fair map,
with contours shown, although incorrectly.</p>

<p class="pf400">There are MS. maps of the siege in the British Museum. Other MS. maps of Yorktown and the neighboring
waters, including the drawn plan made for Faden's engraved map, are among the Faden maps (nos. 90,
91, 92) in the library of Congress.</p>

<p class="pf400">There are among the Rochambeau maps in the library of Congress several illustrating the siege of Yorktown
and attendant movements in Virginia:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pf400">No. 50, <i>Carte des environs d'Hampton</i>, 1781, measuring 36 x 24 inches, and colored faintly.</p>

<p class="pf400">No. 52, a pen-and-ink <i>Plan de Portsmouth, Va.</i>, 15 x 12 inches.</p>

<p class="pf400">No. 53, <i>Plan des ouvrages de Portsmouth en Virginie</i>, colored, 15 x 12 inches.</p>

<p class="pf400">No. 54, <i>Carte detaillé de West Point sur la rivière de York au confluent des rivières de Pamunky et
Matapony</i>, a colored sketch.</p>

<p class="pf400">No. 56, a pen-and-ink sketch, <i>Plan des environs de Williamsburg, York, Hampton and Portsmouth</i>, measuring
12 x 12 inches.</p>

<p class="pf400">No. 57, a colored plan, 3 x 4 inches, showing the French army in camp, Sept., 1781, called <i>Carte des environs
de Williamsburg en Virginie</i>.</p>

<p class="pf400">No. 58, <i>Plan d'York en Virginie, avec les attaques faits par les armées français et Américain en Oct.
1781</i>, a colored sketch.</p>

<p class="pf400">No. 59, <i>Siége d'York, 1781</i>, a colored plan, 23 x 24 inches.</p>

<p class="pf400">No. 60, <i>Plan des ouvrages faits à Yorktown en Virginie</i>, a tracing, 24 x 20 inches.</p>

<p class="pf400">No. 61, a sketch in ink and water-colors, with an elaborate key, <i>Notes sur les environs de York</i>, 24 x 12
inches.</p>

<p class="pf400">Balch refers to a MS. map by Soulés, preserved in the Archives de la Guerre at Paris, and another attached
to the MS. <i>Journal de mon séjour en Amérique</i>, which he attributes to Cromot-Dubourg. Soulés' map,
<i>Plan d'York en Virginie avec les attaques et les campemens de l'Armée combiné de France et d'Amérique</i>,
is given in his <i>Troubles</i>, etc., vol. iv., reduced in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i> (June, 1880).</p>

<p class="pf400">Another published French map is a <i>Plan de l'armée de Cornwallis, attaquée et faitte prisoniere dans
Yorktown, le 19 8<sup>bre</sup> par l'armée combinée Française et Américaine. Dessiné sur les lieux par les Ingenieurs
de l'armée à Paris. Chez Le Rouge, X<sup>bre</sup>, 1781.</i> Another good French map has no clew to its authorship
except the words "M. fecit." It is entitled <i>Plan de l'Attaque des villes de Yorck et Gloucester dans
lesquelles etoit fortifié le Général Cornwallis fait prisonnier le 19 Octobre, 1781</i> (a copy in Harvard College
library). Two anonymous French maps are: <i>Plan d'York en Virginia avec les attaques et les Campemens
de l'armée de France et de l'Amérique</i> (fac-simile in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, 1880, p. 440), and <i>Carte de
la partie de la Virginie ... avec le plan de l'Attaque d'Yorktown et de Gloucester</i>. There is also a
Paris map of Virginia, published by Esnauts and Rapilly, giving the <i>Baie de Chesapeake avec plan de
l'attaque</i>.</p>

<p class="pf400">There is a German map by Sotzman.</p>

<p class="pf400">All these maps were based on more or less imperfect surveys. A map giving correct topography, <i>Yorktown,
Virginia, and the Ground Occupied in the Siege of 1781; a topographical survey by direction of Brev.-Maj.-Gen.
G. W. Getty, U. S. A., commanding Artillery School, Fort Monroe, 1880</i>, was drawn by Lieut.
Caziare. A reduced fac-simile is given in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i> (vii. 408,&mdash;described, p. 339). Caziare also
drew the plan, embodying the lines of Faden and Renault, which is given in Patton's <i>Yorktown</i>, p. 34, and
<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, vii. 288. A section of another and earlier government survey, by Major Kearney,
showing the roads as they were in 1818, is in Johnston's <i>Yorktown</i>, p. 103. Cf. his list of maps in <i>Ibid.</i>,
p. 198.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>On the French side we have several contemporary
accounts. First of all I should place an
anonymous journal which has been attributed to
Rochambeau.<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> The <i>Diary of a French Officer,
1781</i> (March 26 to Nov. 18, 1781), presumed to
be the work of Baron Cromot-Dubourg, an aide
to Rochambeau, was brought to light by Mr.
Balch (<i>Mag. Am. Hist.</i>, vii. 295), and is printed
in <i>Ibid.</i> iv. 205, from an unpublished MS. then in
the possession of Mr. C. Fiske Harris,<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> of Providence,

valuable paper of this class that we have. Still
another important diary is the <i>Journal of Claude
Blanchard, Commissary of the French Auxiliary
Army sent to the United States during the American
Revolution, 1780-1783. Translated from the
French MS. by William Duane, and edited by

<p>In 1879 Mr. J. A. Stevens printed in the <i>Mag.
of Amer. Hist.</i> a series of letters from Count
Fersen to his father, occasionally inclosing a bit
of journal, a great deal of which relates to the
operations before and after Yorktown, and it is
in all respects a very valuable contribution. The
greater part of Deux-Pont's <i>Campaigns</i><a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a> relates
to this period, while the <i>Journal of an Officer</i>
(pp. 148-164) and portions of the diaries kept
by the naval officers refer to the same campaign.</p>

<p>The French accounts of the assaults on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
redoubts are in the above. Hamilton's report
to Lafayette is in <i>Remembrancer</i>, xiii. 61, while
Lafayette's report to Washington is in <i>Corresp.

Giradin's <i>Continuation of Burk</i> (iv. 519) contains
a one-sided description; and the lives of
any of the Revolutionary worthies<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> devote a
considerable space to the campaign. Among
these is the <i>Life of Muhlenberg</i> by his son (268-276),
in which an unfounded claim is advanced
for the sire that he commanded the storming
party led by Hamilton. The more popular

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">While</span> the events followed in the preceding chapter were all tending, both by Washington's victory and
Greene's defeats, to a discouragement of the English necessary to induce the British government to desire a
peace, the succession of events in the North had hardly any interdependence, and of themselves conduced but
little to the same end. The campaigns of Sullivan in 1778 and 1779, the dismal failure of the Massachusetts
expedition to Penobscot in 1779, and the plot of Arnold, are considered in other chapters. A brief commentary
upon the other transactions of this period here follows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
The spring of 1779 was not an encouraging one for the cause. Washington had kept his main army during
the winter at Middlebrook (Irving, iii.; Greene's <i>Greene</i>, ii. 160), and he was now resolved on a defensive campaign
(Bancroft, x. ch. 9). He gave his views to Congress (Sparks, vi. 158); but that body inspired little confidence.
It did something to increase the efficiency of the army in creating an inspector-general (<i>Journals</i>,
iii. 202); but its internal bickerings were sadly discouraging (Greene's <i>Hist. View</i>; Bancroft, x. 208; Greene's
<i>Greene</i>, ii. 170, 175; John Adams's <i>Works</i>, i. 292). The legislators were powerless to regulate prices as they
wished, and riots were in progress at their very doors (Reed's <i>Reed</i>, ii. ch. 6). They sent <i>A circular letter</i> to
their constituents, and urged enlistments in an address (May 26th; Niles's <i>Principles</i>, etc., 1876, p. 405); while
Gouverneur Morris prepared for them some <i>Observations on the American Revolution, published according
to a Resolution of Congress, by their Committee for the Consideration of those who are desirous of comparing
the Conduct of the Opposed Parties, and the several Consequences which have flowed from it</i>
(Phila., 1779). (Cf. Sparks's <i>Gouv. Morris</i>, and the letter of Thomas Paine, <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 20.)</p>

<p>Early in July (2d) there was an affair between Tarleton and Col. Sheldon at Poundridge in Westchester
(Tarleton's <i>Memoirs</i>; <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, iii. 685). Washington, as the season advanced, kept to the Highlands,
and an attempt to draw him down was made by Clinton in dispatching Tryon with a marauding
force to invade Connecticut by water. Tryon's instructions,
July 2d, are in Charles H. Townshend's <i>British Invasion
of New Haven and Connecticut, with some account of
the burning of Fairfield and Norwalk</i>. They did not contemplate
the destruction of houses; and Johnston, in his
<i>Observations on Judge Jones</i> (p. 59), controverts that Tory
chronicler who charged such intent upon Clinton. Cf. Hinman,

July 4th, to the inhabitants of Connecticut. Tryon subsequently
published an <i>Address of Maj.-Gen. Tryon, written
in consequence of his late expedition into Connecticut</i>

the autumn (<i>Hist. Mag.</i> ii. 10).</p>

<p>The posts at Stony Point and Verplanck's
had been begun as outposts of West Point, and
to protect King's Ferry, the crossing below the
Highlands. Before the works were finished the
British had captured them, in June (Sparks's
<i>Washington</i>, vi. 292). Washington planned a
surprise of the British garrison, and the two annexed
sketches, furnished to him by Gen. Heath,
seem to have been prepared in anticipation of
the movement.</p>

<p>The first, "Stoney Point", is from a pen-and-ink
sketch, indorsed "From Genl. Heath, letter
3d July, 1779", which is among the Sparks maps
in Cornell University library, and carries the following
<span class="smcap">Key</span>: 1, the capital work on the highest
part of the point, commanding the out-flêches,
which is conformed to the broken eminence it is
built on; 2, 3, 4, 5, flêches built on so many little
eminences, each with one embrasure; but in
the principal work (1) the number of embrasures
is uncertain, being covered by the works and
the declivity of the hill. Two rows of abatis
(× × ×) cross the point from water to water.

<p>The lead of the movement was entrusted to Wayne. His instructions, in Washington's handwriting, are
given in Dawson, in fac-simile (p. 18). His orders are dated July 15 (Niles, <i>Principles</i>, 1876, p. 495; <i>Essex
Inst. Hist. Coll.</i>, v. 7). Wayne's first report of his successful attack to Washington is given in fac-simile in
Armstrong's <i>Wayne</i>, Dawson, and Lossing (ii. 179); and his longer account of the next day is in Sparks's
<i>Washington</i>, vi. 537; and in <i>Ibid.</i> vi. 298, is Washington's report to Congress. H. B. Dawson's <i>Assault on
Stony Point</i> (Morrisania, 1863) is an elaborate monograph. H. P. Johnston has a special paper in <i>Harper's

The medals given to Wayne, De Fleury, and Stewart are described in Loubat. (Cf. Lossing, ii. 180, 181.)
A rude view of the capture in Bickerstaff's (Boston) <i>Almanac</i>, 1780, is reproduced in <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>,
xvi. 592.</p>

<p>A few weeks later (Aug. 19), Major Henry Lee emulated Wayne in a sudden attack on Paulus Hook (Jersey
City). We have reports on both sides. That of the British, General Pattison's, is in Duncan's <i>Royal Artillery</i>,
ii. 355, and his letter to Townshend in <i>N. Y. Hist. Coll.</i>, 1875, p. 79. On the American side we have accounts
in Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, vi. 317, 326, 332-336, 376; Lowell (<i>Hessians</i>, 228) says that R. E. Lee's statement
(in H. Lee's <i>Memoirs</i>) that Paulus Hook was captured by a stratagem is not borne out by Marshall
(<i>Washington</i>, iv. 87) or by the German accounts (Ewald, ii. 295). Cf. Moore's <i>Diary</i>, ii. 206; Irving's <i>Washington</i>,
iii. 475; Dawson's <i>Battles</i>; Quincy's <i>Shaw</i>, 65; Reed's <i>Reed</i>, ii. 125; Duer's <i>Stirling</i>, 204; Bancroft,

ser., iv. 264). George H. Farrier prepared a <i>Memorial of the centennial celebration of the battle of Paulus
Hook, Aug. 19th, 1879</i> (Jersey City, 1879), which has an appendix of documents.</p>

<p>Loubat and Farrier give an account of the medal presented to Lee.</p>

<p>The annexed sketch, "Paulus Hook", is from a draft
of an original Hessian map in the library at Cassel, furnished
by Mr. Edward J. Lowell (cf. his <i>Hessians</i>, p. 228),
with the following <span class="smcap">Key</span>: A, Covering force of the attacking
Americans. B, Line of attack on the block-houses (1, 2, 3)
and fort (C), which mounted seven six-pounders, which
were not used. D, Barracks in which one hundred and
ten prisoners were taken. E, Work occupied by a Hessian
captain, one officer and twenty-five men, possessed at the
time the Americans retired, at daybreak. (Cf. plan in
Lossing, ii. 828.) Farrier gives a plan from an original in
the library of Congress.</p>

<p>The winter of 1779-80 was an exceptionally severe one
in the North (Jones's N. Y., i. 320; Greene's <i>Greene</i>, ii.
184; Leake's <i>Lamb</i>; Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>, ix.) After
Clinton had gone South to attack Charleston, Knyphausen
was left in command in New York (Eld's journal in
<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xviii. 73; Eugene Lawrence on
life in N. Y. in Hist. Mag., i. 37; Jones's <i>N. Y. during

<p>Washington was encamped at Morristown, New Jersey.
Views of his headquarters are in Lamb's <i>Homes of America</i>;
<i>Appleton's Journal</i>, xii. 129; Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>,
i. 309, and his <i>M. and M. Washington</i>, 191. (Cf. <i>Poole's
Index</i>, p. 873; <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, xviii. 289; <i>Mag. of Amer.
Hist.</i>, iii. 89, 118.) Letters of Washington, while in Morristown, in addition to those given in Sparks, are
in <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, iii. 496. Orderly-books are in N. Y. Hist. Soc. cabinet and in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
xvii. 48.</p>

<p>The trials and deprivations of the army were so great that Washington did not dare take advantage of an
ice-bridge formed across the Hudson, for an attack on New York, though the British feared that he might.
There were varying councils on this point in the American camp (Duer's <i>Stirling</i>, ch. viii.). The British apprehension
(Feb., 1780) is shown in Duncan's <i>Royal Artillery</i>, ii. 359; <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, 1875, pp. 147,
152. The difficulties in the American camp are followed in Irving's <i>Washington</i>, iv. ch. 1 and 4; Thacher's
<i>Mil. Journal</i>; J. F. Tuttle in <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, June, 1871, and <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, Feb., 1859. A lack of money in
the paymasters' chests caused dissatisfaction, which grew into an insurrection. The British, seeking to increase
the trouble, marched into New Jersey, under General Matthews, but they were driven back, and waited
on the coast till Clinton, returning from Carolina, reinforced them, when they again advanced. Washington,
meanwhile, suspecting an incursion up the Hudson, had gone thither with a large part of his troops, leaving
Greene at Morristown. Greene met the British and defeated them at Springfield, when they returned to New
York. The progress of these events can be followed. On the American side, Greene's <i>Greene</i>, ii., and his
letters in Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, vii. 75, 506; Gordon, iii. 368; Marshall's <i>Washington</i>; Sedgwick's <i>Livingston</i>;

Atkinson's <i>Newark</i>, 104; Hatfield's <i>Elizabeth</i>, ch. 22; <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, iii. 211, 490. On the British side,
Moore's <i>Diary</i>, ii. 285; Simcoe's <i>Queen's Rangers</i>; in letters in <i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, 1875, p. 458. George
Mathew, of the Coldstream Guards, wrote an account (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 103,&mdash;App., 1857), and some details are
in the <i>Court Martial of Col. Cosmo Gordon</i> (London, 1783). For maps, John Hill's, published by Faden,
1784, is the principal one. Cf. Carrington; Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, i. 322; and the map of Elizabethport
Point (1775-1783) by E. L. Meyer, published in 1879.</p>

<p>What is known as the affair of Bull's Ferry (July 21, 1780) was an unsuccessful attempt by Wayne upon a
block-house garrisoned by Tories. (Cf. <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, v. 161; Armstrong's <i>Wayne</i>; Sparks's <i>Washington</i>,
vii. 116; and his <i>Corresp. of Rev.</i>, iii. 34, 37; Sargent's <i>André</i>, 234.) André wrote on this misadventure of
Wayne the well-known doggerel verses called <i>The Cow-Chace</i>, part of Wayne's project having been to gather
cattle. The verses appeared in three numbers of <i>Rivington's Gazette</i> (New York, Aug. 16, 30, Sept. 23, 1780;
Menzies, $23), and were republished by Rivington separately, 1780 (J. A. Rice's sale, $265), and also in Philadelphia,
1780. The book was reprinted at London with notes in 1781; at New York in 1789 (Morrell's <i>Catal.</i>,
$36); at London in 1799, with Dunlap's tragedy of <i>André</i> (Menzies, 61, $23); at Albany in 1866, edited by
F. B. Hough; at Cincinnati in 1869. André seems to have made several copies of the MS. Sargent prints
it from one of these. Another belonged to Dr. W. B. Sprague, and Lossing printed from this (<i>Field-Book</i>, ii.
878; <i>Two Spies</i>, 68). It will also be found in Moore's <i>Songs and Ballads</i>, 299; J. A. Spencer's <i>United
States</i>, vol. ii. etc.</p>

<p>The summer was barren of military interest. Steuben was trying to reorganize the army (Kapp's <i>Steuben</i>,
ch. 12-15). The low condition of the army is shown in Washington's letters (Sparks, vii. 156; <i>Corresp. of
Rev.</i>, iii. 15; <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, Aug., 1879). Washington issued a circular letter on the army's distress (<i>New
Hampshire State Papers</i>, viii. 870; cf. <i>Journals of Congress</i>, iii. 469). The British intercepted some mournful
letters, and printed them (<i>Political Mag.</i>, ii. 73).</p>

<p>In August there was a gathering of delegates from the New England States at Boston, "to advise the most
vigorous prosecution of the war, and provide for the reception of our French allies." The <i>Proceedings</i> of this
meeting have been edited from the original MS. by F. B. Hough (Albany, 1867). In November a convention
of the Northern States at Hartford sought methods of furnishing men and supplies (<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, Oct.,
1882, viii. 688; and Clinton's knowledge of it in <i>Ibid.</i> x. 411).</p>

<p>Hope revived with the prospect of the arrival of Rochambeau and the French, in July, 1780 (Heath's
<i>Memoirs</i>, 243; <i>Corresp. of Rev.</i>, iii. 12). The first communications of Washington and Rochambeau are in
Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, vii. 110, and App. 4, with an account of Lafayette's conference with the French.
Rochambeau's instructions are in <i>Ibid.</i> vii. 493. The letters of Rochambeau and Lafayette are in the <i>Sparks
MSS.</i>, lxxxv.</p>

<p>The English fleet blockaded the French in Newport harbor. The <i>Political Mag.</i>, 1780, has a map showing
the blockade of the French admiral Ternay by Arbuthnot. Letters of the English admiral are in the <i>Hist.
MSS. Com. Report IX.</i>, App. iii. p. 106.</p>

<p>On the occupation of Newport by the French, see Mason's <i>Newport</i>; <i>Newport Hist. Mag.</i>, ii. 41; iii. 177;
Stone's <i>French Allies</i>, 256; <i>Lippincott's Mag.</i>, xxvi. 351; Drake's <i>Nooks and Corners of the N. E. Coast</i>;
<i>Harper's Mag.</i>, lix. 497. The correspondence of Rochambeau and the Rhode Island authorities is in the <i>R. I.
Col. Rec.</i>, ix. There is a diary of a French officer in <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, iv. 209; and Fersen's letters are in
<i>Ibid.</i> iii. 300, 369, 437.</p>

<p>Several maps of Newport and vicinity are given in the <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, like the plan of the town by Blaskowitz;
the <i>Defences of Newport, 1781</i>, from a MS. French chart; and the <i>Scene of Operations before Newport,
1781</i>, from a MS. survey by Robert Erskine, geographer to the American army, of which the original is
in the cabinet of the N. Y. Hist. Society.</p>

<p>There are among the Rochambeau maps several plans of Newport and its neighborhood, including no. 38,
<i>Plan de Rhodes Isle et position de l'armée française à Newport</i>, measuring 5 x 3 inches, colored and showing
roads, fences, forts, and the fleet in the harbor; no. 39, <i>Plan de la ville, port, et rade de Newport, avec
une partie de Rhode Island, occupée par l'armée française</i>, evidently by the same draftsman as the preceding,
dated 1780, colored, measuring 24 x 30 inches, showing forts, Gen. Sullivan's old camp, the old line of the
English, etc.; no. 41, a plan, 8 x 15 inches, called <i>Quatre positions de la flotte française et position de la flotte
anglaise</i>; no. 42, evidently by Montresor, colored, measuring 4 x 3 inches, dated 1780, called <i>Plan de la position
de l'armée française au tour de Newport, et du mouillage de l'escadre dans la rade de cette ville</i>. Le
Rouge published a map of this title in Paris, in 1783. Cf. map in <i>Political Mag.</i>, i. 692.</p>

<p>On the French participation in the war we have Rochambeau, <i>Mémoires</i>, with an English translation by
Wright, and the <i>Troubles</i> of Soulés, which is supposed to have been inspired by Rochambeau. Cf. Walsh's
<i>Amer. Register</i>, ii. The other French contemporary accounts are the <i>Mémoires</i> of Count Ségur and the Duc
de Lauzun; the <i>Travels</i> of Abbé Robin and of Chastellux, of which there is an English translation by George
Greive (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, April, 1869); the <i>Journals</i> of Deux-Ponts, edited by S. A. Green, and of Claude
Blanchard. (Cf. <i>Revue militaire française</i>, and Tuckerman's <i>America and her Commentators</i>.) The later
French accounts in general are Leboucher's <i>Hist. de la guerre de l'indépendance des Etats-Unis</i>; Balch's
<i>Les français en Amérique</i> (1872), Chotteau's <i>Les français</i>, etc. A comprehensive later American account
is E. M. Stone's Our <i>French Allies</i>. Cf. Lossing in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, xlii. 753.</p>

<p>Counter attacks of Clinton on Newport and of Washington and Rochambeau on New York were prevented
by untoward circumstances (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, vii. 130, 137, 171, with App. 6; Jones's <i>New York during
the Rev.</i>, i. 358; <i>Mémoires</i> of Rochambeau).</p>

<p>In September, 1780, Washington had an interview with Rochambeau at Hartford to devise further operations,
but the plot of Arnold disconcerted all measures (E. M. Stone, 281; Irving's <i>Washington</i>; J. C. Hamilton's
<i>Republic</i>, ii. 49). Alexander Hamilton had drawn up a plan of combined operations.</p>

<p>In October there was an unsuccessful expedition to Staten Island (<i>Life of Pickering</i>, i. ch. 17; <i>R. I. Hist.
Soc. Coll.</i>, ii. 257; <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 104).</p>

<p>Washington was now in camp at Totowa and Preakness, in New Jersey. There are a map and view of his
headquarters in <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, Aug., 1879. Cf. orderly-book in <i>2 Penna. Archives</i>, xi., and Journal of
Capt. Joseph McClellan in <i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p>The Pennsylvania line was at Morristown, under Wayne, and in January, being without pay and supplies,
they revolted, and marched towards Philadelphia to claim redress of Congress. The New Jersey line was
similarly affected. Prompt and judicious measures quelled the mutiny, but not till some emissaries, whom
Clinton had sent to increase the trouble, had been hanged by the insurrectionists. Original sources: Wayne's
letters to Washington, in the <i>Corresp. of Rev.</i>, iii. 192; Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, vii. 348, with App. x.; proposal
of a Committee of Sergeants, with Wayne's comments, in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>, xxxix. p. 100 (also no.
liv. 5); documents in <i>Penna. Archives</i>, viii. 698, 701, 704, and ix.; second series, xi.; <i>Colonial Records</i>, xii.
624; <i>Hazard's Register</i>, ii. 160; <i>St. Clair Papers</i>, i. 108, 532; <i>Bland Papers</i>, ii. Cf. also Marshall's <i>Washington</i>,
iv. 393; Irving's, iv. 195; Hamilton's <i>Hamilton</i>, i. 323, and <i>Works</i>, ii. 147; Amory's <i>Sullivan</i>, 181;
<i>Madison Papers</i>, i. 77; Reed's <i>Reed</i>, ii. ch. 14. Clinton's report is in Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>, xi. 148. The
information reaching the British camp is in Clinton's <i>Secret intelligence</i>, in <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, x. 328, 331,
418, 497; an account of the hanging of the British emissaries is in the <i>Hist. of First Troop of Philad. City
Cavalry</i>, p. 28.</p>

<p>Washington and Rochambeau had held a conference at Weathersfield, Conn. (May 22, 1781), to arrange for
a plan of combined action (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, viii. 517, for their views respecting the safety of Newport,
meanwhile). The conference was held at the Webb House (<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, June, 1880). The French
army then moved by way of Providence to the Hudson, and there is among the Rochambeau maps in the
library of Congress a plan of their route, with key, giving their twelve encampments on the way (nos. 42
(bis), 43, 44). <i>Marche de l'armée française de Providence à la Rivière du Nord, 1782.</i> In the <i>Mag. Amer.
Hist.</i> (iv. 299) there is a map of the <i>Route of the French from Providence to King's Ferry</i>, following a MS.
attached to a diary of a French officer.</p>

<p>Rochambeau established his headquarters at the Odell House, in Westchester (Stone, <i>French Allies</i>, 394;
C. A. Campbell in <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, iv. 46). On June 12th, the two commanders held a council of war at
New Windsor (<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, iii. 102). Clinton's secret journal shows how well the British commander
was informed of what was going on (<i>Ibid.</i> xii. 73, etc., 162, etc.). Beside the correspondence of Washington
at this time, in Sparks, there are other letters in Ibid. iv. and v. Washington's first attempt to act in union
with the French was in the proposed attack on the forts on New York Island. (Cf. Washington's journal in
<i>Ibid.</i> vi. 117; xi. 535.) There is among the <i>Lincoln Papers</i> (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, xii.) a "memorandum to regulate
the movements of the allied army on the night of the 31st of July, 1781." J. A. Stevens follows the operations
of the combined armies at this time (<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, iv., Jan., 1880). He gives a map of the attempt at
King's Bridge, July 3, 1781. There is among the Rochambeau maps an excellent draft, about thirty inches
wide by fifteen high, showing New York with Long Island, with the French camp as high up as Tarrytown,
called <i>Position du camp de l'armée combinée de Phillipsbourg du 6 Juillet au 19 Août, 1781</i>. Stevens gives
a fac-simile of this, and also a map of the environs of New York between the Sound and the Hudson, called
<i>Surveys in New York and Connecticut States for his Excellency, Gen. Washington, by Robert Erskine,
Anno 1778, W. Scull delin.</i>,&mdash;a MS. plan in the New York Hist. Soc. library (<i>Proc.</i>, 1845, p. 56), where is
also a MS. <i>Chart of the Harbour of New York, with a map of the Country bordering upon the Sound, and
extending to the Connecticut, with the names of the principal places laid down thereon, by Robert Erskine,
1779</i> (<i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1848, p. 188). The Rochambeau maps contain other evidences of the activity
at this time of the French topographical engineers; as, for instance, a plan (no. 29) done in ink and color,
measuring ten inches wide by twelve high, and not very exact, called <i>Reconnaisance Juillet, 1781, ouvrages
[de] Morrisania, Isle de New York</i>, by Montresor and Buchanan, and a second (12 x 15 inches) which gives
the works at Frog's Point (no. 30), and adds to the title "Plan d'une batterie de Long Island." Another
(no. 32), called <i>Reconnaisance des ouvrages du nord de l'Isle New York, 22-23 Juillet, 1781</i>, measures twelve
inches wide by fifteen high, apparently the work of Montresor, and shows Fort Washington, Laurel Hill, etc.
It was Washington's purpose at this time to make Clinton expect an attack on New York (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>,
viii. 54, 130, 517; <i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, 2d series, i. 327). Clinton has recorded his reason why
he did not venture to attack Washington in July and August, while the Americans were encamped at King's
Bridge (<i>New York City during the Rev.</i>, New York, 1861, pp. 177-184). By August 14th, the coöperation of
the French fleet being assured, Washington decided to march to Virginia (<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, vii.; also xi.
343; <i>Diplom. Corresp.</i>, xi. 417). He said the main cause of his coming to this decision was the failure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
New England States to supply men (<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, vi. 125). Washington's headquarters at this time were
in the Livingston mansion (Lossing, ii. 195).</p>

<p>The question of Washington having been made a marshal of France has caused some discussion. <i>Hist. Mag.</i>,
ii., iii.; E. M. Stone's <i>French Allies</i>, 373; Balch, <i>Les Français en Amérique</i>, 122.</p>

<p>While Washington marched towards Virginia, the marauding expedition which Clinton had sent under
Arnold, along the Connecticut coast, failed to divert him from his purpose, as the British commander had hoped
it would. The attack fell upon New London and Groton, early in September. Trumbull's letter to Washington
is in the <i>Corresp. of Rev.</i>, iii. 403. Cf. Stuart's <i>Trumbull</i>, ch. 45; Arnold's account in the <i>Polit. Mag.</i>,
ii. 666; Sparks's <i>Arnold</i>, and Arnold's <i>Arnold</i>; "Sir Henry Clinton and the burning of New London", in
<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, March, 1883, p. 187. There are contemporary accounts in <i>N. E. Hist. and Gen. Reg.</i>, x.
127 (1856); Niles's <i>Principles</i> (1876), p. 143; Moore's <i>Diary</i>, ii. 479; and in the <i>Narrative of Jonathan
Rathbun, with accurate accounts of the capture of Groton fort, the massacre that followed, and the sacking
and burning of New London, Sept. 6, 1781, by the British forces</i>, by Rufus Avery and Stephen Hempstead,
with an appendix (1810).</p>

<p>The principal monograph is William W. Harris's <i>Battle of Groton heights: a collection of narratives,
official reports, records, etc., of the storming of Fort Griswold, the massacre of its garrison and the burning
of New London by British troops. With introd. and notes; rev. and enl. with additional notes, by
Charles Allyn</i> (New London, 1882). The original issue was in 1870. The perfected edition is enriched with
many documentary proofs.</p>

<p>There have been other anniversary addresses: Tuttle's at Fort Griswold (1821); W. F. Brainerd's (1825);
Griswold's in commemoration of Col. Ledyard (1826), who was run through by his own sword after he had
surrendered it; R. C. Winthrop's (1853) in his <i>Addresses</i> (1852-1867, p. 84); Leonard W. Bacon's, with an historical
sketch by J. J. Copp, in the <i>Battle of Groton Heights</i> (1879).</p>

1879), p. 62, with views in Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 43, 46.</p>

<p>A paper by C. B. Todd on the massacre (<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, vii. 161) has an account of Ledyard and his
family, with views of his house in Hartford and the monument on Groton Heights (cf. Harris and Allyn, p.
179), and a list of the slain. Gov. Trumbull made a report on the losses inflicted at New London and Groton,

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid"><a name="c563" id="c563">THE NAVAL HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.</a></p>

<p class="pc1">BY THE REVEREND EDWARD E. HALE, D. D.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE battles of the Revolution were fought on the sea as often as on
the land, and to as much purpose. The losses inflicted on their enemies
by the United States in their naval warfare were more constant, and
probably more serious, than any losses which they inflicted elsewhere. At
the beginning of the war, the mercantile class of England, even then a
powerful element in her politics, were far more indifferent to the questions
at issue than they became afterwards, when the rates of maritime insurance
began to rise rapidly. These high rates had begun long before France and
Spain entered into the struggle; and the captures which the English navy
made by no means compensated England for the losses which she sustained.
In such a contest, it generally proves that the richer combatant is he who
pays the most. The loss of an English Indiaman or a Mediterranean trader
on her voyage to "the Pool",<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> or to Bristol, was but poorly compensated by
the capture of even a dozen American schooners laden with salt fish and
clapboards.</p>

<p>The men of New England, after the early exodus of the Tories, were
almost unanimously engaged against England, and they were engaged with
that intensity of purpose which belongs to Puritans and to republicans.
They were then almost wholly a maritime race; and those ethnologists
who think that New Englanders have a larger share of Norse blood than
most Englishmen may well justify their theory by the fearlessness of the
genuine Yankee upon the sea and his passion for maritime adventure. So
soon, therefore, as the outbreak of hostilities began to disturb the natural
course of their commerce, the seamen of the New England coast took up
the business of cruising against their enemies, as if it were quite normal
and something to which they had been born and trained.</p>

<p>New England was at this moment an important factor in the maritime
interest of the world. She had special facilities for ship-building. In that
essential department of maritime commerce her artisans excelled any in the
world, and for three quarters of a century the export of ships, which were
sold abroad, had been one of the most profitable features of New England
commerce. It required two thirds of a century after John Winthrop built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
the "Blessing of the Bay" to persuade the masters of the royal ship-yards
that there was any timber in America which they could use in preference to
that which they received from Norway.<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> But Lord Bellomont, as early as
1700, had urged that the king should not buy his spars in the open market
in England, but should send his own vessels to New England for them. In
the same letters he pointed out to his correspondents that the effect of the
present regulations was that the Americans shipped spars to Portugal, which
were then used in the navy of France. In point of fact, when at last, in
1778, all four parties were engaged in the Revolutionary War, the spars of
most of the vessels of England, France, Spain, and America had all been
cut in the forests of New England. It is, indeed, quite within the memory
of men now living that in the wildernesses of Maine or New Hampshire
some fine old monarch of the forest might still be found bearing the broad
arrow of the king of England. He had been marked for the royal navy
while King George yet reigned over half this continent, and he had been
spared from the axe by the Declaration of Independence.<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a></p>

<p>A people thus bred to the sea, and able to assert themselves upon it, lost
no time, when they found themselves at war with England, in carrying
their war upon the element to which they were born. They won their first
naval victory over England on the 5th of May, 1775, scarcely a fortnight
after the battle of Lexington. The "Falcon", a British sloop of war, had,
under some pretence, seized one or more prizes from the people of Buzzard's
Bay. Inspired probably by the success at Lexington and Concord,
the people of New Bedford and Dartmouth fitted out a vessel, with which
they attacked and cut out one of the "Falcon's" prizes, with fifteen prisoners,
from a harbor in Martha's Vineyard. On the 12th of June the people
of Machias, in Maine, seized the "Margaretta", a king's sloop, and two
other vessels. The captain and his crew resisted, but he was killed, with
one of his men, and five were wounded.<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> Her armament was transferred
to another vessel, which was placed under the command of Jeremiah
O'Brien, who received from the government of Massachusetts a commission
as marine captain. As early as the 2d of September, Washington,
who was then in command at Cambridge, issued commissions, authorizing
those who held them to cut off the supply-vessels of the English as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
entered the harbor.<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> The provincial congress at once legalized their capture,
so far as its enactments could do so, and six vessels were commissioned
by the province of Massachusetts Bay,&mdash;the "Lynch", the "Franklin",
the "Lee", the "Washington", the "Harrison", and the "Warren."</p>

<p>On the 16th of October, Washington, acting under instructions from
Congress,<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> directed Broughton and Selman, captains in the Marblehead regiment
of Continentals, to take their companies on board the "Lynch" (six
guns) and "Franklin" (four guns), and attempt to intercept in the river St.
Lawrence two English transports bound for Quebec, with military stores.
They did not find these two vessels; but they took ten other prizes, attacked
and took a fort on the Island of St. John, and brought off as prisoners of
war the governor and one of the judges of that island.<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> On their return
in December to Massachusetts, both officers were reprimanded for exceeding
their instructions, and both prisoners and prizes were released. The
Congress and Washington were still maintaining a friendly attitude towards
Canada and the other northern provinces, and gave up prizes and prisoners
in hopes of conciliating them. Meanwhile, on the 29th of November,
another Marblehead captain, John Manly, in command of the schooner
"Lee", took the brigantine "Nancy" from London, as she entered Massachusetts
Bay, laden with military stores for Howe.<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> We have the contemporary
records of the joy of the Americans at Cambridge, and the dismay
of the besieged in Boston. The extemporized camp of the besiegers read
with delight from the invoice of her stores such phrases as "two thousand
muskets", "one hundred and five thousand flints", "sixty reams of cartridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
paper", "thirty-one tons of musket shot", "three thousand round-shot
for 12-pounders, four thousand for 6-pounders."</p>

Congress, charge of the frigate "Boston."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>Before the end of 1775 the Continental Congress ordered that five ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
of thirty-two guns should be built, five of twenty-eight, and three of
twenty-four. This order was carried out, and these vessels are the proper
beginning of the navy of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> Almost every one of them,
before the war was over, had been captured, or burned to avoid capture.
But the names of the little fleet will always be of interest to Americans, and
some of those names have always been preserved on the calendar of the
navy. They are the "Washington", "Raleigh", "Hancock", "Randolph",
"Warren", "Virginia", "Trumbull", "Effingham", "Congress", "Providence",
"Boston", "Delaware", "Montgomery." The State of Rhode
Island, at the very outbreak of hostilities, commissioned Abraham Whipple,
who went with his little vessel as far as Bermuda, and, from his experience
in naval warfare earned in the French War, he was recognized as commodore
of the little fleet of American cruisers. England had no force at
Bermuda to resist him, and he found the inhabitants friendly. A raid,
directed by Congress, had already brought from the island all the powder
in their stores, and this was one of the first supplies which Washington
received at Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> Meanwhile, every maritime State issued commissions
to privateers, and established admiralty or prize courts, with power
to condemn prizes when brought in. Legitimate commerce had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
largely checked,<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> and, as has been said, the seamen of the country, who had
formerly been employed in the fisheries,<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> or in our large foreign trade with
the West India Islands and with Europe, gladly volunteered in the private
service. Till the end of the war the seamen preferred the privateer service
to that of the government. This fact, indeed, materially affected the somewhat
bold proposals with which the Continental Congress began the war;
and, at the time when the war virtually closed by Cornwallis's surrender,
the national government, if it can be called such, had very few vessels in
its service.</p>

<p>The larger maritime States had in commission one or more vessels from
the beginning, but they found the same difficulty which the Congress found
in enlisting seamen, when any bold privateer captain came into rivalry with
them. The States of Massachusetts, of Rhode Island, of Connecticut, of
Pennsylvania, of Virginia, and of South Carolina had, however, as we shall
see, each nominally a naval force of its own, all through the war. The
general disposition of all parties being the same, it was not difficult to
unite Continental ships, state ships, and privateers, on occasion, in the same
endeavor.</p>

<p>In March, 1776, the English fleet in Boston Bay, with a large number of
transports, carried to Halifax the whole English army, and those inhabitants
of Massachusetts who did not venture to remain.<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> Meanwhile, the
English government at home was sending large reinforcements to Howe,
and he was not as successful as he could have wished in meeting at sea the
vessels which brought them, and turning them into Halifax. Among the
first considerable successes of the privateers and the armed ships of Massachusetts
Bay were the capture of several of these vessels as they came
unsuspiciously toward the harbor of Boston. The Connecticut brig "Defence",
of fourteen guns, the Massachusetts State schooner "Lee", of
eight, and three privateer schooners attacked two armed English transports
off Cape Cod, and captured them after a sharp action of an hour.
The next day they took a third, and in this way five hundred prisoners
fell into the hands of the Americans. This was on the 17th and 18th of
June, 1776.<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a></p>

<p>As early as the 22d of December, in 1775,<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> Congress had appointed
Esek Hopkins, of Rhode Island, commander-in-chief of its navy, and had
named four captains beside, with several lieutenants, the first of whom
was John Paul Jones. Hopkins and the rest fitted a squadron of eight
small vessels, of which the "Alfred" (twenty-four guns) was his flag-ship.
Jones was with him as his lieutenant. With this force they made a descent
upon New Providence in the Bahamas, and although they failed in obtaining
a stock of powder, which they had hoped for, they did capture a hundred
cannon and a large quantity of other military stores.</p>

of the War in America</i>, London, 1780, p. 310,

of the American Sea-forces", in a sketch

is cited in the <i>United Service</i>, Feb., 1885, etc. A
more common picture is given in Murray's <i>Impartial

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span></p>

<p>On his way home, Hopkins took a tender of six guns and a bomb brig off
Long Island, and on the 6th of April, with a part of his squadron, engaged
the English ship-of-war "Glasgow", of twenty guns. He did not take her,
but the audacity of the attack, made by vessels each of which was her
inferior, pleased the country, and it was at first represented as a great
victory. When it was learned that Hopkins had five vessels, however
small, to the Englishman's one, a reaction of public feeling took place,
from which he never recovered. He was honorably acquitted by a court-martial,
but never regained full public confidence, and he does not appear
in the public naval service afterwards. This hasty public condemnation
seems to have been unjust, and to have cost the country the service, in its
national navy, of a skilful and brave commander.<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a></p>

<p>While Hopkins was undergoing his trial, on the 10th of May, 1776, Paul
Jones was appointed to the command of the "Providence", in place of Hazard,
who did or did not fight her as he should have done in the engagement
with the "Glasgow." Through the summer, Jones was engaged in cruising.
At one time he ran as far as Bermuda, and afterwards to the eastward as
far as Canso. In this summer cruise he made sixteen prizes, and his reputation
as a favorite dates from this time.</p>

<p>On the 10th of October a resolution of Congress fixed the rank of
captains in the navy. James Nicholson<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> was first, Manly second, McNiel
third, Saltonstall fourth, Lambert Wickes eleventh, John B. Hopkins fourteenth,
and Paul Jones eighteenth on a list of twenty-four.<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a></p>

<p>Jones was not pleased that his rank was not higher, but eventually his
achievements were such that his reputation probably now stands higher as
a successful officer than that of any of the number.</p>

<p>While he was cruising at the East, Nicholas Biddle,<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> in the "Andrea
Doria", a little brig carrying fourteen 4-pounders, took two armed transports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
filled with soldiers, and captured many merchantmen. On returning
from his cruise he was appointed to the "Randolph" (thirty-two guns),
which had been built that summer in Philadelphia and was launched in the
autumn. Biddle's reputation was high in consequence of his success, and
early in 1777 he sailed on the "Randolph's" first cruise. He captured
four Jamaica-men when he was three days out, one of which had an armament
of twenty guns, but he was then blockaded in Charleston by an English
force through the summer.<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a></p>

<p>In the autumn of 1776, Jones, at Newport, took command of the "Alfred"
(twenty-four guns) and "Providence" (twelve guns), and in the month of
November went to sea. He was fortunate enough to take the armed ship
"Mellish", with stores for Burgoyne's army. But while returning to Boston
with her, he met the "Milford" (thirty-two), an English frigate. He
succeeded in turning her away from his prize and brought it into Boston
harbor. The "Mellish" had ten thousand suits of uniform on board, in
charge of a company of soldiers. It was when he arrived that Jones found
that he was only eighteenth on the list of captains, and this really meant
that there was hardly a ship which he could expect in the service, and
that if he found any it would be even inferior to the "Alfred."</p>

<p>On this occasion he first used Poor Richard's rule, "If you want a thing
done, do it yourself." He went to Philadelphia to urge his own claims
on Congress or its naval committee. But they could not work impossibilities,
and it was not till some months later that he was appointed to the
"Ranger." He believed that she was the first armed vessel to display the
national American flag. It was not till November, 1777, that he got to sea
with her. He hoped to carry out the great news of Burgoyne's surrender.
But the government of Massachusetts had been too quick for him. They
had commissioned the brigantine "Perch", with a special messenger, Jonathan
Loring Austin, and he had arrived in France with the news some
days before Jones appeared.</p>

<p>Lambert Wickes, the eleventh on the list of captains, had been the first
officer to carry a national cruiser across the ocean. He was directed to
take Dr. Franklin to France in the "Reprisal", and did so,&mdash;in a voyage
which gave Franklin a high opinion of his ability. Several times he beat to
quarters when an attack from a hostile force seemed possible, but with
such a passenger he did not, of course, court an action. When near the
coast of France he made two or three prizes and brought them in with him.</p>

<p>His arrival and theirs, and the arrival of some other prizes which had
been taken early in the year by other privateers, opened all the questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
regarding neutrality, which recently, in our civil war and afterwards, made
the history of the cruiser "Alabama" so important a feature in modern
international law. France made no treaty with America until the end
of 1777. Till that time&mdash;indeed, until the formal rupture with England&mdash;she
was under very strict treaty obligations with that power. The
Treaty of Utrecht (1713) provided that "it shall not be lawful for any
foreign Privateers to fit their ships in the Ports of one or the other of the
aforesaid Partys, to sell what they have taken, or in any manner whatever
to exchange either Ships, Merchandises, or any other Ladings." Wickes
was annoyed and provoked at the treatment he received from French
officials, who pretended to observe the obligations by which the French
king was thus bound. But he succeeded in going to sea again, and made
a successful cruise around Ireland, taking several prizes.<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a></p>

<p>The French people looked with great satisfaction on such captures. But
war was not yet declared with England by France, and the French cabinet
knew perfectly well that the act of Wickes involved a flagrant violation of
French neutrality. The fitting out war-vessels in French ports was not
only wrong, under a fair construction of international law, but the king of
France had specially waived all right to harbor privateers of foreign powers&mdash;unless
they were in actual distress&mdash;by these special articles in this
treaty. Wickes could never understand this. He knew that France was
sending munitions of war to his countrymen. Why should France not permit
him to bring his prizes into French ports to sell? And the temptation
was great. Once and again he slipped out to sea; and he sent in one and
another prize. But at last Vergennes, the French minister, could bear it
no longer. Poor Wickes's last letters show how strong the hand of France
was, even upon her friends.<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span></p>

<p>All the diplomacy of Franklin, the good-nature of Vergennes, and the
real sympathy of the French people could not forever prevail. Wickes
was at last ordered squarely to make ready for America, and did so. But,
alas! the refitting seems to have been incomplete, and he never reached
the United States. His vessel was lost off Newfoundland, and only one
man was saved.</p>

<p>The other name which should rank with those of Jones and Wickes as one
of those early naval heroes who in a courageous though fitful manner kept
the stars and stripes afloat in European waters, and infested the English
shores to the annoyance of their merchant marine and the terror of the maritime
towns, is that of Gustavus Conyngham. In the spring of 1777, before
Wickes had rendered himself so utterly obnoxious to the French ministry as
he afterwards did&mdash;before the complaints of Lord Stormont had received
much attention, Silas Deane, ever on the lookout for the accomplishment
of some successful naval enterprise, took thought with William Hodge, a
Philadelphia merchant, and planned what was to be the boldest raid yet
made upon the English shipping. A lugger was purchased at Dover and sent
around to Dunkirk, that old nest of smugglers and privateersmen. She was
fitted out with an armament and crew, and given, with the name of the
"Surprise", to Gustavus Conyngham, for a raid on the English marine. The
expedition was partly public and partly private in its nature. Conyngham
was, however, an officer in the navy, for he was furnished with one of the
blank commissions given the commissioners for that very purpose, signed by
John Hancock, president of Congress. This point was of some importance
to him afterwards, when he was accused by the English of piracy. The
charge was groundless. The commissioners had received power to create
officers in the navy of the United States, by virtue of these blank commissions,
which were to be filled out to suit the circumstances. Conyngham
sailed from Dunkirk with instructions to cruise in the British Channel for
merchant vessels, and to look particularly for the "Prince of Orange" packet
from Harwich. He was fortunate. On one of the very first days of the
cruise he came across the packet, captured her without a blow, and then
made sail with his prizes for Dunkirk. He had also taken a brig.</p>

<p>But this breach of French neutrality was too shameless. A storm of English
complaint compelled the French court to take firmer measures than
they may have desired. Conyngham and his crew were put in prison, the
lugger was confiscated, the prizes were returned. The French, indeed, went
so far that the English government, quite deceived by their great zeal, sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
over vessels to bring to England Conyngham and his crew to be tried for
piracy. But to this point the French could not quite go.</p>

<p>The affair caused great excitement in England. It was so unexpected,
so bold, so audacious, that no one could tell what would come next. As
a consequence, insurance rose quickly. British ships were no longer considered
safe, even in the English Channel. There were at one time in the
Thames as many as forty French vessels loading with English merchandise,
while it is said that ten per cent. was sometimes paid as insurance for
the short passage between Dover and Calais. Although the measures of
the French government tended to quiet apprehension, it was some little
time before confidence was restored.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the planners of the first scheme had resolved to repeat the
outrage. Another cutter was bought, again at Dover, and equipped with
fourteen sixes and twenty-four swivels. Conyngham's release was obtained
through the courtesy of the French ministry, and that of his crew, by the
representation that they were to sail upon a trading voyage. Mr. Hodge
himself went surety for the truth of this statement. The French court did
not like the business; they would have preferred that the expedition should
be abandoned, and they offered to purchase the cutter of its owners. But
it was declared to the ministers that the voyage was for trading purposes
only, and that the owners would suffer serious loss if it were not allowed to
proceed, and they gave way. The business is not a clear one. It seems
evident that the French suspected that all was not as it should have been,
but that they were deceived as to the real object of the expedition. It is not
probable that they desired to blind themselves to the truth, for they were
at this time in a delicate position with England through the operations of
Wickes, Johnston, and Nicholson, and there was but little in the aspect of
American affairs that would have tended to make them consider an alliance
with the United States with such seriousness as to be willing to allow the
English ministry to have more cause for complaint than could be helped.
However this was, Conyngham sailed in the "Revenge" on the 18th of
July for another cruise, by no means a trading voyage. In this case, also,
although the ship was undoubtedly fitted out in a measure by private parties,
Conyngham himself sailed with a regular commission. His former one
had been taken from him when he was imprisoned, and sent to Versailles,
and was never heard of again. This second commission was drawn on one
of the blanks with which the commissioners were furnished.</p>

<p>This cruise was even more successful than the former, although no such
capture was made as that of the Harwich packet. Conyngham made prize
of several ships, alarmed the English merchant marine again, threatened the
English coast, actually refitted his vessel in an English port, having made
his way thither in disguise, and escaped with safety to Spain in course of
time. Most of his prizes were disposed of to the benefit of the United
States government as well as of the private parties concerned. There was
more English complaint in Paris, but nothing actually came of it beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
imprisonment of Mr. Hodge in the Bastille. But he was shortly released
on such representations by the commissioners as seem to have satisfied the
French court.</p>

<p>Captain Johnston does not appear among the twenty-four captains first
commissioned by Congress; but in the spring of 1777 he took the "Lexington"
across to Europe, and arrived there in April. With the "Dolphin",
under Lieutenant Nicholson, a brother of Nicholson who was senior captain,
he went to sea under Wickes's command in the cruise which has been
described. But in a second cruise fortune failed him. He engaged the
"Alert", an English man-of-war cutter of force somewhat less than his own;
but after a long action, having expended all his ammunition, he was obliged
to surrender. It is said that his little vessel was the first to bear the American
flag in an ocean victory. She had already been taken once, and once
recaptured by her own crew, after they had been placed under an English
prize crew. She had taken many prizes, and had won for herself a reputation
in both hemispheres in only one year and eight months, which comprise
all her American service.</p>

<p>As a consequence of her capture, Johnston and his crew were made
prisoners. At one time the English had nearly one thousand American
seamen imprisoned in Forton, near Portsmouth. But the successes of
Jones and other cruisers, after the French alliance enabled the Americans
to keep their prisoners, compelled the English administration to assent to
an exchange; and in the winter of 1779-80, most of the Americans were
released by such exchanges.<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible, within the space at our command, to give any detail
of the successes of the various armed vessels, whether fitted out by individuals,
by States, or by the Congress on the shores of the United States.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
A good authority<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> says that, in 1776, 342 sail of English vessels were
captured by the Americans. Of these, forty-four were recaptured, eighteen
released, and the rest carried into port. The same authority tells us that in
the year 1777 the commerce of England suffered a loss of 467 sail, though
the government kept seventy cruisers on the American coast alone. Such
successes were not of course without their compensations. In March the
English captured the brig "Cabot", of sixteen guns, one of the first American
cruisers. When Gen. Howe took Philadelphia the Americans were
obliged to destroy the "Andrea Doria", the "Wasp", and the "Hornet."
The "Raleigh", one of the Continental frigates, got to sea from New Hampshire.
She engaged the "Druid", an English vessel in convoy of the Windward
Island fleet, and disabled her, so that she returned to England.</p>

<p>When 1778 began, of the new frigates ordered in 1775, the "Congress"
and "Montgomery" had been burned in the Hudson that they might not
be taken; the "Delaware" had been captured in the bay whose name she
bore, and the "Hancock" taken off Halifax. At about the same time the
"Randolph" blew up, as has been told. In 1778 the "Washington" and
"Effingham" were burned in the Delaware by the enemy, and the "Virginia"
was captured by a squadron of theirs on her first voyage. To
supply the places of the unfortunate ships which were lost so soon after
they were built, the government had commissioned the "Alliance", the
"Confederacy", the "Deane", afterwards called "The Hague", and the
"Queen of France." Of these, the three first carried thirty-two guns each,
and the last twenty-eight. The "Alliance" and "The Hague" were the
only two, of all the seventeen, which remained in the service when the
war was over. While the American naval force, so far as it was under
Continental orders, was thus insignificant for any action against an English
fleet of more than seventy vessels, the arrival of D'Estaing with a large
French fleet off the capes of the Delaware, in July, did much to hold that
force in check and to compel it to act on the defensive. Before describing
the movements of D'Estaing's fleet, we must return to the eastern side of
the Atlantic, and continue the history of naval warfare on the coast of
England.</p>

<p>Such captures as those made by Wickes and Conyngham, under the very
eye of the English nation, naturally attracted more attention among those
who led the public opinion of England than did any captures made by the
navy of America on her own coast, and there were bolder movements yet
to claim their attention than any we have chronicled.</p>

<p>John Paul Jones was a native of Scotland, but at an early age he removed
to America, and he had been engaged there in commerce many years
before the breaking out of the war. As the reader has seen, he crossed
the Atlantic in hopes of obtaining a better vessel than Congress could give
to him on this side of the water. But he found on his arrival that no such
vessel was to be had at once. He therefore refitted the "Ranger", the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
vessel in which he had crossed the ocean, and in the month of April, 1778,
he made a bold descent on the coast of Scotland and England. In this
expedition he took the English ship "Drake", of a force quite equal to his
own, and he brought her with him as a prize into the harbor of Brest. In
this voyage he made a landing on the Scotch coast, and his men carried
off the family plate from the mansion of the Earl of Selkirk. Jones
himself had been in the service of this nobleman, and he made it a point
of honor to buy back the plate from his men and send it to the Countess
of Selkirk.</p>

<p>The news of his exploit was of no little importance for the American
name in France. It seemed to open an opportunity for giving to Jones
the command of the "Indian", a fine vessel then upon the stocks, and
through the summer he was amused by this hope and by various enterprises
which were proposed for so energetic a leader. Of his disappointments
and of his renewed expectation full record has been left in his
letter-books. One of the plans was that of a descent on the English coast,
to be made by a French force under the command of La Fayette. Jones
was to be the naval leader of this expedition. But as the alliance of
France with America was now determined on, the French government enlarged
their plans. D'Estaing was sent to the American coast, and La
Fayette and Jones were told that their services would not be needed. In
the midst of these disappointments, Jones had given up the command of
the "Ranger", which he would have thought better than nothing. It is
at this moment that he says he adopted "Poor Richard's" motto, which,
as our reader knows, he had tried before in America,&mdash;"If you want a
thing done, do it yourself",&mdash;and went to Paris himself to urge his claims
for employment. The result of his visit was that an old Indiaman was
bought for him, which he transformed into a two-decked frigate, and to this
ship, in compliment to Franklin, his fast friend, he gave the name of "Bonhomme
Richard", that being the French translation of "Poor Richard."
She was armed and equipped in haste, which, as it proved, was almost
ruinous. The "Alliance", under Landais, the "Pallas", hired for the expedition,
and two smaller vessels, joined the squadron. These two vessels
were privateers, and the cost of the whole expedition seems to have been
borne, in part at least, by private adventurers. The seamen were persons
of all nationalities. But Jones and his own officers on the "Richard" were
Americans serving under the American commission. With this heterogeneous
squadron Jones sailed, and the several vessels made a good many
rather insignificant prizes. They passed around the north of Scotland, and
came down on the east side of the island into the Northern Ocean. On
the 23d of September he discovered the Baltic squadron of merchantmen
in the convoy of the frigate "Serapis", and the "Countess of Scarborough."
Jones's squadron at this time consisted of the "Richard", the
"Alliance", and the "Pallas." The English squadron was commanded by
Richard Pearson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span></p>

<p>Pearson signalled to his convoy to take care of themselves, and at once
engaged the American squadron, unless we say that they engaged him.
The "Pallas" took the "Countess of Scarborough" in an action of which
we have not any such account as could be wished for. The fight between
the "Richard" and the "Serapis" was long and close, and proved indeed
to be one of the most remarkable naval duels in history. The two vessels
were of about the same force in respect to the number of guns. But
on the first discharge of the lower-deck guns of the "Richard", two of
them burst, so inferior was their metal, and the men at the other guns on
that deck refused to fight their batteries, probably not unwisely. They
repaired to the upper deck, and through the rest of this remarkable action
the lower-deck guns of the "Serapis" were served against the main deck
of the "Richard" without receiving any reply. Jones fastened the ships
together, it is said, with his own hand, as soon as they first touched each
other. Through the action their sides were so close that not only at the
moment when one party attempted to board the other, but for most of
the battle, it was easy to pass from ship to ship. They had been for some
time engaged when the firing of the "Richard" slacked, and Pearson called
to know if she had struck. It was then that Jones made the ominous
reply which has become almost proverbial: "I have not begun to fight."
When he did begin to fight he showed all the remarkable qualities which
certainly made him a great naval commander. He was willing to serve
guns with his own hands, but he kept an eye on everything which was
passing on both ships. He succeeded in so placing one or two of his guns
that he nearly raked the enemy's deck fore and aft, and it was almost impossible
for any man to stand against his fire. This terrible action raged
through several hours of the night. The anxieties attending it for the
Americans were the more acute, because Landais, in the "Alliance", rendered
no direct assistance, but hovered around, firing occasional shots,
which the American seamen always declared were aimed at their vessel
and not at their enemies. The crisis came at last, when some sailors
on the main-yard of the "Richard" succeeded in dropping hand-grenades
through the open hatchways of the "Serapis" upon the men at work there.
One of these grenades fired some loose powder, which was followed by the
explosion of a powder-chest, which demoralized all the crew in that part of
the vessel. Pearson was obliged to surrender. But so close and so confused
had been the action that it is said that his first officer, when he heard
the cry "She has struck!" believed that it was their antagonist that had
surrendered, so confident was he still of victory.</p>

<p>Jones carried the prizes, the "Serapis" and the "Scarborough", into the
Texel, in Holland. The "Richard" was so damaged that she sank the day
after the battle.</p>

<p>It may readily be imagined that this exploit, by which two English
men-of-war were carried away in triumph under the very eyes of the
people of Scarborough, excited immense attention in all Europe. Jones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
was the hero of the hour. He was literally crowned with laurel at the
theatre, and the French government made him the most flattering proposals
with a view to his taking command in their service. Jones himself
and all his officers were mad with rage at the conduct of Landais.
Nothing but the enthusiasm of the alliance between the two nations had
made him the commander of an American frigate. Franklin and Jones
would have been glad to try him by court-martial, but this proved impossible.
He was sent home in the "Alliance", and on the way became evidently
insane. All necessities of a court-martial were thus avoided.<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a></p>

<p>This ill-success of Landais was a good enough illustration of the danger
of entrusting seamen of one nation to a commander from another. Either
this danger or some other consideration prevented the French government
from employing Jones. But the hope of such service was so constant with
him that he took no command from the government of the United States
for some time. And thus his service, which might have been of great importance,
was lost, while he was dangling in antechambers.</p>

<p>These conflicts on the coast of Europe attracted, as has been said, more
of the attention of Europe than the naval battles between England and
America in other seas. But the years 1777 and 1778 had not passed without
frequent naval engagements on the American coast, some of them of
considerable importance. In May, 1777, Manly took the "Hancock" and
"Boston", frigates from the port of Boston, with which he captured the
English frigate "Fox." The three vessels looked into the harbor of Halifax,
and drew into action the "Rainbow", the "Flora", and the "Victor",
a superior force. The two smaller American vessels escaped, but the "Hancock"
was sacrificed.</p>

<p>The "Raleigh", one of the thirteen frigates built for the Continent, had,
as the reader knows, made a successful cruise in the end of 1777. The
next year, with the "Alfred", one of the little favorites in the beginning
of the war, she sailed from France. Both vessels were overtaken by a
superior English force, and the "Alfred" was lost, though the "Raleigh"
succeeded in reaching Boston. At that time most of the naval force of
the Congress was in Boston harbor. It consisted of but three vessels,
the "Warren", the "Raleigh", and the "Deane", each of thirty-two guns.
The State of Massachusetts had in the same harbor the "Tyrannicide", the
"Independent", the "Sampson", and the "Hancock", of fourteen guns and
of twenty. But besides this little fleet, so insignificant in itself, hundreds
of privateers were afloat, many of them of force nearly equal to the
largest of the vessels which have been named.</p>

<p>It had been the hope of Franklin in Paris, of Paul Jones, his naval adviser,
and of the court to which they both gave counsel, that D'Estaing's fleet
might arrive off Delaware Bay in time to shut up the English fleet there.
The same issue was feared in England.<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> But D'Estaing was just too late.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
He arrived on the 7th of July off the capes; he only landed his passengers,
Deane, and Gérard, the new French minister, and without even watering
his fleet followed the English fleet to New York. Had he entrapped them
in the Delaware, a crisis like that of Yorktown might have come three
years earlier.</p>

<p>But the harbor of New York was too well protected by the intricacies of
its channels to make an attack possible. D'Estaing remained in the offing
off Sandy Hook for some days, and then bore away for Newport. His coöperation
with the army of Sullivan is described in another place.<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a></p>

<p>A full letter from Cooper to Franklin exists among the Franklin papers,<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a>
which gives D'Estaing's own view of the transactions which followed, and
that view is probably substantially correct. When he threatened the English
fleet in New York Bay, it consisted of six ships of the line, six fifty-gun
ships, two of forty-four guns, with smaller vessels. When he entered
Newport Bay the English burned the "Orpheus", the "Lark", the
"Cerberus", and the "King-Fisher",&mdash;of various force, from thirty-two
guns to twenty,&mdash;and several smaller vessels. When, in conjunction with
Sullivan, D'Estaing attacked the town, the English burned the "Grand
Duke" and the "Flora", of thirty-two guns, with fifteen transports. While
he was in Newport Bay, Byron's English fleet reinforced the fleet in New
York, and they were now strong enough to retaliate on D'Estaing and
give to him the challenge which he had so lately given to them. With a
fleet of thirty-six sail, fourteen of which were double-deckers, they appeared
off Newport.</p>

<p>D'Estaing was not averse to a contest. On the 10th of August, with the
advantage of a fresh north wind, he took his squadron to sea. The English
admiral, Howe, slipped his cables and went to sea also. D'Estaing did
not avoid a battle, and, in the gale which followed, engaged the rear of the
English fleet. But his own flag-ship, the "Languedoc", was dismasted in
the gale, and, after communicating with Sullivan again, he went round to
Boston to refit.</p>

<p>Samuel Cooper, in writing the letter to which we have alluded, is well
aware that there was some popular disappointment because the Count
D'Estaing had not done more. But he resumes the whole by saying:
"The very sound of his aid occasioned the evacuation of Philadelphia by
the British army; his presence suspended the operation of a vast British
force in these States, by sea and land; it animated our own efforts; it
protected our coast and navigation, obliging the enemy to keep their men-of-war
and cruisers collected, and facilitated our necessary supplies from
abroad. By drawing the powerful squadron of Admiral Byron to these
seas, it gave security to the islands of France in the West Indies, an equilibrium
to her naval power in the Channel, and a decided superiority in the
Mediterranean."</p>

<p>When it is remembered that, in the events of the summer and autumn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
the English lost twenty vessels in their collisions with D'Estaing's fleet, it
must be granted that its exploits were by no means inconsiderable.</p>

<p>Of the American ships which have been spoken of, the "Raleigh" was
the only one which was seriously engaged in this year. She put to sea on
the 25th of September, with a
small convoy. Before night she
was pursued by two cruisers of
the enemy. Barry, the commander,
ran his ship on shore and saved his officers and men; but the
"Raleigh" was floated by the English and taken into their service.<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, in adventures which separately do not claim the dignity of
historical narrative, the public and private cruisers from New England so
swept the ocean that they sent into Boston most of the provision ships
intended for the English army in New York. D'Estaing was able to leave
Boston on the 3d of November for an expedition to the West Indies, with
a fleet provisioned with the very stores which had been provided for his
enemies. His vessels had been thoroughly repaired, cleaned, and sailed in
good condition, and well fitted for the important duty assigned to them.</p>

<p>Early in 1779 the "Alliance" was fitted out for France, from Boston, to
take General Lafayette on an important mission home. She was under the
command of Pierre Landais, of whose misbehavior afterwards, in the battle
of the "Serapis", the reader has been informed. Landais was already so
unpopular that American sailors would not enlist under him, although the
"Alliance" herself was a favorite vessel. Lafayette was, however, eager to
be on his way, and at his urgent instance a crew was made up by accepting
the services of English seamen, prisoners of war, who had been taken when
the "Somerset" was shipwrecked on Cape Cod. As might have been expected,
a mutiny was planned before she reached France; but it was fortunately
revealed by an Irish seaman who was loyal to his new country.
Passengers and officers united in confining the mutineers, and the ship was
safely brought to France. She was a fine, new, swift vessel. Seamen liked
her, though they disliked Landais. Another crew was obtained for her, and
it was thus that she sailed with Paul Jones. It has been more convenient
to speak of her after-history as we described transactions in the European
waters.</p>

<p>In April, a squadron of three vessels, commanded by Hopkins in the
"Warren", sailed from Boston and overtook a fleet of transports and store-ships
which Clinton had sent from New York to Georgia. Hopkins captured
eight out of ten vessels, of which three were armed. By this brilliant
success the Americans took as prisoners twenty-four officers and a
large number of private soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same summer, Whipple, one of the old commanders, in the "Providence",
fell in with a large convoy of English merchantmen bound from
the West Indies to England. The American officer disguised his vessel,
or concealed her character, so that he boldly entered the fleet as one of
their number. As night fell, on each of ten successive days he boarded and
captured some vessel from the convoy, and eight of the prizes thus taken
arrived in Boston. Their cargoes were sold for more than a million dollars,
and the bold venture is spoken of as the most successful pecuniary
enterprise of the war.</p>

<p>Early in the same year, Hallett, in the "Tyrannicide", a cruiser of the
State of Massachusetts, took the "Revenge", a privateer cruiser from
Jamaica.<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> In the same summer, John Foster Williams, in the Massachusetts
cruiser "Hazard", engaged the "Active", an English vessel with a
larger force, with success. He was then transferred to the "Protector", a
ship of twenty guns, in which he engaged the "Duff", an English privateer,
which blew up after an action of an hour.<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a></p>

<p>These successes, perhaps, stimulated the State of Massachusetts to attempt
an enterprise which proved the most unfortunate in her military history,
and was the end of her separate state naval force. John Foster Williams,
who had commanded the "Protector", was very popular, and he was
placed at the head of the state squadron, consisting of the "Tyrannicide",
the "Hazard", and the "Protector", fitted out by the State against the English
post at Penobscot, which was then within her own borders. The state
authorities obtained from Congress, as an accession to their own force, the
"Warren", the "Diligent", and the "Providence", which were nearly all
that were left of the Continental navy. Some privateersmen joined the
expedition. The whole naval force was placed under Saltonstall, who had
a Continental commission. The land force consisted of 1,500 militiamen.
This little force landed near the end of July; but Lovell, the land commander,
thought his force insufficient, and sent for reinforcements. While
they were waiting, Sir George Collier appeared with five English vessels.
Saltonstall did not dare engage them, and ran his own ship, the "Warren",
on shore and burnt her. Most of the other vessels followed his example,
and the rest were captured by the English. The crews, with the land forces,
abandoned the expedition, and returned to Boston by land.</p>

<p>The national navy of the United States was thus reduced to the very
lowest terms. Of the few vessels left, four were taken by the English
when they captured Charleston, namely, the "Providence", the "Queen of
France", the "Ranger", and the "Boston." Nor had Congress much enthusiasm
for replacing them. In the first place, Congress had no money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
with which to build ships; and in the second place, the alliance with France
gave it the use of a navy much more powerful than it could itself create.<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a>
It was also clear enough that the great prizes to be hoped for in privateering
gave a sufficient inducement to call out all the force the country had for
naval warfare. The history of such warfare can never be written, but the
damage which the privateers inflicted upon the enemy's commerce was
such that the mercantile classes of England became bitterly opposed to
the war. On the other hand, it has been said, and probably truly, that
New England, the home of the privateers, was never more prosperous than
in the last years of the Revolution, so large were the profits made in privateering
enterprises.</p>

<p>After the fall of Charleston, the principal vessels left in the national
navy were the "Alliance", the "Hague", formerly the "Deane", the "Confederacy",
the "Trumbull", the "Saratoga", and the "Ariel." In February,
1781, the "Alliance" crossed to France, and started to return with the
"Marquis de Lafayette", a ship of forty guns, laden with a very valuable
cargo of stores for the government. A few days after, she took the "Mars"
and the "Minerva", heavily armed privateers, and then parted from her
consort. The "Lafayette" was captured soon after, to the great distress of
the American army, which needed her stores; but the "Alliance" completed
her cruise, and, on the 28th of May, captured the "Atalanta" and the
"Trepasy", two English cruisers. The "Atalanta", however, was subsequently
taken by an English squadron. The "Confederacy", which was
launched in 1778, was captured by the English in the West Indies, on the
22d of June. Captain Nicholson, in the "Trumbull", after a romantic
series of adventures, surrendered to the "Iris" and the "Monk" in August
of the same year. The "Congress" in September captured the sloop-of-war
"Savage." In the next year, which was the last of the war, the
"Alliance" made a cruise in which she maintained her reputation. The
"Hague", the only frigate which remained to the nation, having been given
to Manly, whose success in the beginning of the war gave such joy to
Washington and his army, "this officer in a manner closed it", as Fenimore
Cooper says, "with a very brilliant cruise in the West Indies."</p>

<p>The signal success of Count de Grasse in blocking up Lord Cornwallis
in the Chesapeake, and the history of his engagements with Rodney and
others, belong more properly to another chapter of this history.<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a></p>

<p>It is a misfortune for the history of this country that no intelligent man
in New England interested himself in the systematic history of the privateer
enterprises of the United States in the Revolution while the seamen
lived who engaged in them. But no such person undertook this historical
work, and the materials do not now exist from which it could be thoroughly
done. Some details noticed by authors of the time excite attention and
surprise as they reveal the magnitude and number of the prizes made by
the privateers. Such is the statement, cited above, that the prizes sent in
by Whipple in one cruise exceeded one million dollars in value. Hutchinson,
in his diary, reports the belief that seventy thousand New Englanders
were engaged in privateering at one time. This was probably an overestimate
at that moment. But it is certain that, as the war went on, many
more than seventy thousand Americans fought their enemy upon the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
On the other hand, the reader knows that there was no time when seventy
thousand men were enrolled in the armies of the United States on shore.<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1781 the privateer fleet of the port of Salem alone consisted
of fifty-nine vessels, which carried nearly four thousand men, and mounted
seven hundred and forty-six guns. In 1780 the Admiralty Court of the
Essex district of Massachusetts, which was the largest of the three admiralty
districts, had condemned 818 prizes. It must not be supposed that
other districts were insignificant. In the single month of May, 1779,
eighteen prizes were brought into New London.</p>

<p>As has been said, there seems to be no method of making any complete
computation of the magnitude of the privateer fleet at any one time. But
an incomplete list in the <i>Massachusetts Archives</i> of those commissioned in
that State gives us the names of two hundred and seventy-six vessels. As
the reader has seen, the fleets from Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Philadelphia
were also large. It would probably be fair to say that between the
beginning and end of the war more than five hundred privateers were commissioned
by different States. The magnitude of the injury inflicted upon
the English trade by these vessels may be judged by such a comparison
as is in our power of the respective forces. In the year 1777 the whole
number of officers and men in the English navy was eighty-seven thousand.
Although Hutchinson's estimate is probably an overestimate, it is to be
remembered that, as the reader has seen, there were at the same time very
considerable naval forces in the employ of the several States and of the
United States government. This would seem to show that, man for man,
the numerical forces engaged by the two parties were not very much unlike.
In the Atlantic Ocean, the Americans seem to have outnumbered the
English.</p>

<p>After the navy of the United States, which was officered and built or
purchased by Congress, the largest separate force was that of the State of
Massachusetts. So soon as O'Brien and his friends seized the "Margaretta",
as has been told, the provincial government took her into its
service, and christened her the "Liberty", keeping her at first under the
care of O'Brien.</p>

<p>For the first five years of the war, Massachusetts was governed by a
committee of the Council. Many of the members of this committee, from
time to time, were Boston merchants, of large experience in maritime
affairs. The State was acting as an independent sovereignty. It contributed
to the resources of its allies, the other States in the confederation,
but none the less did it carry on war against the common enemy. It
would sometimes happen that the State needed to make a remittance to
France in its purchase of military stores. If the market were favorable,
the merchants on the council boards would arrange for the purchase or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
charter of a vessel on State account, and the State bought and sent to
Europe the freight by which it made its payments to its agents. The
naval archives of the commonwealth are therefore a curious mixture of
warlike operations and of commercial adventure. It will sometimes happen
that the vessel which appears in one month as a cruiser, officered and
manned for war by the authority of the State, shall appear in another
month as a merchantman, freighted for a foreign port and intended to bring
home a cargo to be sold to the credit of the State. An interesting instance
of the promptness of the government was its readiness in taking up and
fitting for use a little brigantine which carried to Franklin, in Paris, the first
news of Burgoyne's surrender. Paul Jones hoped, as has been seen, to carry
out the same news in the "Ranger" from Philadelphia; but although his
passage was but twenty days in length, he did not arrive at Bordeaux till
the same day on which Austin, the messenger of Massachusetts, was telling
the great news to Franklin and the commissioners at Passy.<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a></p>

<p>The navy of Massachusetts, between the beginning and end of the war,
numbered at least thirty-four vessels. One or two of these were vessels
which ranked in the language of that day as frigates. The finest and
largest of them was the "Protector", built on state account at Salisbury,
Mass., where the fine frigate "Alliance", which proved so successful and
popular, was also built, almost at the same time. It may be said, in
passing, that the names of the New England vessels showed very distinctly
that men had not yet lost the traditions of their ancestry. The "Tyrannicide"
was a favorite cruiser in the state navy, and the action which has
been spoken of, in which she took the "Revenge", was one of the best
fought battles of the war. The "Oliver Cromwell" was a Massachusetts
privateer, and the name of the "Hampden" appears twice on the lists of
those days. The keel of the "Protector" was laid in 1778, and she sailed
first in 1780. But she was also one of the unfortunate squadron destroyed
in the Penobscot. The failure of the well-planned but disastrous expedition
to that river resulted in the destruction of all the important vessels
belonging to the State.</p>

<p>We have only a partial catalogue of the privateers commissioned by the
State between 1775 and 1783. It is sometimes difficult to draw the line
between state cruisers and privateers, and it will sometimes happen that a
vessel which has one year been chartered by the State, and officered in her
commission, falls back the next year into the hands of her owners, and is
equipped and fought by them under a privateer's commission. In this list
there are rather more than three hundred names of separate vessels. Of
the privateersmen sent out from Salem there is a separate list. Between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
the beginning and end of the war, the Salem vessels alone numbered nearly
one hundred and fifty. The <i>Massachusetts Archives</i> give a list of three
hundred and sixty-five, as commissioned and belonging in Boston. If we
had lists, equally full, of the privateers which sailed from Falmouth (Portland),
from the Merrimac, from Marblehead, from Falmouth, Dartmouth,
Plymouth, Barnstable, and the other towns on Cape Cod, it is probable that
we should enlarge the list of Massachusetts privateers so that it should
include more than six hundred vessels. It is to be remembered that all the
regular operations of the fishing fleet were stopped, and that therefore, in
every town on the coast, there were vessels and men ready for service, and
very easily commissioned if a spirited commander appeared. To this number
must be added the considerable list of what were virtually New England
privateers among the vessels commissioned in France by Deane and
Franklin.</p>

<p>The largest of these privateers, at starting, carried one hundred and fifty
men. Such an exploit as Whipple's, which has been already recorded,
would have been impossible unless he had as many as ten prize crews on
his vessel, of fifteen men each. With each prize sent in, the fighting force
of the captor was reduced, and in such reduction is the reason to be found
why we often find that at the last a privateer captain was not able to fight
his own ship, and, after he had sent in many prizes, was himself taken. On
the other hand, the smallest of these vessels, equipped for short cruises,
carried but few guns and few men.</p>

<p>Mr. Felt's statement of the privateer force of Salem and Beverly at the
end of the war gives a total force of fifty-nine ships, carrying four thousand
men. This would give an average of about sixty-six men to a vessel.
The general estimate is higher, and we suppose that the average crew of a
Massachusetts privateer, when she sailed, was about one hundred men.</p>

<p>If this estimate is correct, we must modify Hutchinson's statement so
far as to say that, sooner or later, Massachusetts alone probably sent sixty
thousand men out in warfare upon the seas. Rhode Island, New Hampshire,
and Connecticut probably sent twenty thousand more. Next to this
fleet was that of the Delaware; next to that, the privateers commissioned
in France; and to these must be added those from the Chesapeake and
more southern waters.</p>

<p>The number of seamen and officers employed by the Continental Congress
was probably largest in the earlier years of the war. No papers now
exist which give full returns of this force. But it would probably be fair
to estimate it as varying in different years from five thousand to ten thousand
men. The several state navies represented, perhaps, as many more.</p>

<p>When one considers these forces in the privateer fleet and the national
and state navies, the English force opposed seems surprisingly small. We
have the official returns of the officers and men in the whole English navy
for every year of the contest. The number comes up to 87,000, after England
was well engaged with America, France, and Spain. But of this fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
a very considerable part was in the East Indies and on other stations.
Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i> says distinctly that the number of men engaged
against the colonies at sea in 1776 was 26,000. It is very sure that in that
year the colonies had many more men at sea engaged against England.
There were some English privateers; but their number was not considerable.</p>

<p>A comparison between the military and naval forces of America in the
Revolution shows that the navy, in its various forms, embodied almost as
many men as the army, and sometimes, indeed, more.</p>

<p>In a report sent by General Knox to Congress on the 11th of May, 1790,
he gives the number of men actually in the Continental army year by year,
the number of militia called out from time to time, and the number of men
demanded in the quotas fixed by Congress. The last figures are of no
great importance now, though they have some historical curiosity. The
others exhibit the forces for seven years, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq">A curiously extravagant estimate of the extent
of the continental forces engaged has been
commonly set forth by adding these yearly figures,
a process which takes no recognition of the
fact that a man serving through three years, for
instance, is counted in each year. The history
of this confusion is traced in a paper by Justin
Winsor in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Jan., 1886.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p class="p1">It is to be observed that the number of militia stated here is largely conjectural;
and in no instance were the men called out in service for any
considerable time. A comparison of these figures with figures quite as
authentic, which give the number of men who were afloat year by year for
purposes of offence, either in the national or state navies, or in larger numbers
in privateers, will show that, in some of the later years of the war, this
naval service enlisted a larger number of men than were serving in the
army. Indeed, as has been shown, Great Britain appears to have often had
more American enemies afloat on the Atlantic than she had seamen and
officers of her own upon that ocean.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> earliest account of the Revolutionary
navy was in Thomas Clark's <i>Naval History of
the United States from the Commencement of the
Revolution</i> (Philad., 1813; second ed., 1814), in
two volumes.</p>

<p>Chas. W. Goldsborough's <i>United States Naval
Chronicle</i>, bringing the story down to 1822, was
printed in Washington in 1824.</p>

<p>In 1828 there appeared at Brooklyn, N. Y., a
<i>General View of the rise, etc., of the American
Navy</i>,&mdash;a book of little importance.</p>

<p>The most important of all the accounts is the
<i>Naval Hist. of the United States</i>, by James Fenimore
Cooper, first published in Philadelphia in
1839, and in a second edition in 1840. In some
respects, relating to the war of 1812, Cooper's
views have been called in question; but his
story of the Revolutionary navy is the result of
investigations that have not, on the whole, been
improved upon.<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> Cooper gives a list of the
Continental cruisers, with the fate of each; and
Lossing, in the summary of the Revolutionary
naval history in his <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 851, copies
this list. An official and authentic record, with
no attempt at a readable narrative, is found in
G. F. Emmons's <i>Navy of the United States, 1775-1853,
with a brief history of each vessel's service,
to which is added a list of private armed vessels,
previous and subsequent to the Revolutionary War</i>
(Washington, 1853, published under authority of
the Navy Department). The book contains a
list of captures during the Revolution, both by
public and private armed vessels.</p>

<p>On the British side, the earliest connected
narrative is that in the fourth and fifth volumes
of Robert Beatson's <i>Naval and Military Memoirs
of Great Britain</i>, 1727-1783 (London, 1804).
Among the later books are C. D. Yonge's <i>Hist.

<p class="p2">I. <span class="smcap">Paul Jones.</span>&mdash;In respect to the lives of
Paul Jones, Sabin's (ix. nos. 36,546, etc.) enumeration
includes many anonymous and unimportant
ones not now to be mentioned. The
earliest biography of any original authority was
one issued at Washington in 1825 (second ed.
1851), <i>Life and Character of John Paul Jones</i>,
by John Henry Sherburne, register of the U. S.
navy, and this was reprinted in an abridged
form at London, the same year as <i>The life of
Paul Jones from original documents in the possession
of John Henry Sherburne, register of the
Navy of the U. S.</i> This life was based upon
documents in the naval archives of the government,
upon some letters contributed by Thomas
Jefferson, and upon some papers brought to light
in a baker's shop in New York (<i>No. Amer. Rev.</i>,
Oct., 1826, p. 292). These papers had been left
by Jones, when he went to Europe, in the hands
of his friend Ross, of Philadelphia. At Jones's
death, and on his heirs' orders, these papers
were handed over to Robert Hyslop, and, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
this gentleman's death, came into the charge of
his cousin, John Hyslop, the baker, in whose
shop they were found by Mr. George A. Ward,
of New York, by whom they were put at Sherburne's
disposal. This biographer, hearing of
other papers in Scotland, applied for them, but
was refused, as it was intended to use them in
another memoir. This other narrative appeared
as <i>Memoirs of Rear Admiral Paul Jones, now
first compiled from his original journals and correspondence</i>
(Edinburgh, 1830, in 2 vols.; London,
1843, in 2 vols.). The author of it referred
rather slightingly to the New York MSS. as "a
few fragments", and claimed that Jones took to
Europe the essential part of his papers, which
by his will passed to his sisters in Scotland, and
eventually to his niece, Miss Janette Taylor, of
Dumfries, who possessed several bound volumes
of them, beside other loose papers. Some of
Jones's papers are in the possession of J. C. Brevoort,
of Brooklyn; others are among the Force
Papers in the library of Congress; and others in
the Lee Papers in the libraries of Harvard College
and of the University of Virginia. Franklin's
letters to him are in Sparks's ed., vol. viii.
The Taylor MSS. were the original material
mentioned in the title of this Edinburgh edition,
which was reprinted, under the editing of
Robert Sands, in New York (1830) as <i>The life
and Correspondence of Paul Jones from original
letters and manuscripts in the possession of
Miss Janette Taylor</i>. The Sparks Library has
a copy of this book, with Miss Taylor's MS. annotations.
Based upon the same material, but
with some alterations and additions, was the
<i>Life of Rear Admiral John Paul Jones, compiled
from his original Journals and Correspondence</i>
(Philad., 1845, 1847, 1853, 1858, 1869), which appeared
under the editing of B. Walker. The
<i>Life of Paul Jones by Alexander Slidell Mackenzie</i>
(Boston, 1841, in two vols.) was written at
the instance of Jared Sparks, and its merit is
that it has sifted all the existing material, making
a more readable and better constructed narrative
than the others. Mackenzie acknowledges
his use of the preceding lives, but says
he has used guardedly a <i>Memoir of the Life of
Capt. Nathaniel Fanning, an American naval
officer, who served during part of the American
Revolution under Commodore John Paul Jones</i>
(New York, 1808), which is known in another
edition as <i>A narrative of the Adventures of an
American Naval Officer</i> (New York, 1806). Fanning
is said to have been Jones's private secretary,
though he is also spoken of as a midshipman
on the "Bon Homme Richard." Thomas
Chase, of Chesterfield, Va., published <i>Sketches
of the life, character, and times of Paul Jones</i>
(Richmond, 1850), which is of small extent, and
in part derived from stories told by the author's
grandfather, who had served with Jones.</p>

<p>A French <i>Mémoire de Paul Jones</i> (Paris, 1798)
purports to be a translation under his own eyes,
by "Citoyen André", of a narrative written by
Jones himself. <i>Poole's Index</i>, p. 695, gives various
periodical references to articles on Jones;
and his career is the subject of J. F. Cooper's
novel of <i>The Pilot</i>, and of its sequel, Dumas'
<i>Capitaine Paul</i>. Cf. Herman Melville's <i>Israel
Potter</i>. The Rev. E. E. Hale gives a chapter (no.
xiv.) to his career in his <i>Franklin in France</i>.</p>

<p>For Jones's services in the "Ranger", see,
beside the lives of Jones, the <i>Annual Register</i>
(xxi. 176); Parton's <i>Franklin</i> (vol. ii.); a journal
of Dr. Ezra Green in the <i>N. E. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1875, edited by Admiral Preble
(whose own copy with additions is in the Mass.
Hist. Soc.). A log of the "Ranger" is cited
as belonging to a gentleman in Greenock in
1830; and one, Aug. 24, 1778, to May 10, 1780,
is printed in the <i>Granite Monthly</i>, v. 64. The
<i>Memoirs of Andrew Sherburne, a pensioner of
the navy of the Revolution</i> (Utica, 1828; Providence,
1831) covers the service of a lad on the
ship.</p>

<p>Of the remarkable fight of the "Bon Homme
Richard" and the "Serapis" we have Jones's
account in his letter from Texel to Franklin,
also transmitted to Congress; the narrative of
Dale, his lieutenant; and the letter sent to the
admiralty by Capt. Pearson, of the English ship.
These are given by Sherburne, the Edinburgh
editor, and others. The account in Cooper's
<i>Naval History</i> passed under the eye of Dale.
The log-book of the "Richard" was in 1830 in
the possession of George Napier, of Edinburgh.
The statements about the progress of the fight
are somewhat contradictory, and Dawson (<i>Battles</i>,
554) collates them. A letter of Jones to
Robert Morris, Oct. 13, 1779, is in the <i>N. Y.
Hist. Coll.</i>, 1878, p. 442. Beside the accounts
in the lives of Jones and the general histories,
see Parton's <i>Franklin</i> (ii. 335); <i>Analectic Mag.</i>
(vol. viii.); Allen's <i>Battles of the British Navy</i>;
J. T. Headley's <i>Miscellanies</i>. The effect in England
is depicted in Albemarle's <i>Rockingham and
his Contemporaries</i> (ii. 381). The story of the
flag of the "Bon Homme Richard" is told by
Admiral G. H. Preble in his <i>Three Historic
Flags</i> (<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, Jan., 1874,
and separately with additions, Boston, 1874,&mdash;the
author's annotated copy being in the Mass.
Hist. Soc.). There is a contemporary print of
the fight by Peltro, after a painting by Robert
Dodd (London, 1781). Cf. Barnard's <i>Hist. of
England</i>, p. 693.</p>

<p>Jones accused Landais, who commanded the
"Alliance", of failure to afford assistance, and
of even firing into the "Bon Homme Richard."
Landais published a <i>Memorial to justify Peter
Landais' conduct during the late war</i> (Boston,
1784), and a <i>Second Part</i> (New York, 1787?),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
being his defence against the specifications of
<i>Charges and proofs respecting the conduct of Peter
Landais</i> (New York [1787]). Landais' quarrel
with Jones and his subsequent career are traced
in Hale's <i>Franklin in France</i>, ch. xvii. For Landais'
claims on government, see B. P. Poore's
<i>Descriptive Catal. of govt. publications</i>, pp. 61, 67,
82, 94; and Jones's claims can be traced in
<i>Ibid.</i> Cf. <i>Journals of Congress</i>, iv. 796.</p>

<p>The <i>Diplomatic Correspondence</i> (vol. i.) shows
the complications which the harboring of Jones
and his prizes in Holland caused. For titles
on this point, see Sabin (ix. 36,562, etc.) and
Muller, <i>Books on America</i> (1872), p. 187, and
nos. 1,181-1,187. The difficulty occasioned by

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">II. Privateering.</span>&mdash;The Provincial Assembly
of Massachusetts, Nov. 13, 1775, authorized
private-armed vessels to cruise, and established
a court for condemning their prizes,&mdash;the law
being drawn by Elbridge Gerry (Austin's <i>Gerry</i>,

<p>For the early captures, see <i>Siege of Boston</i>,
269, 272, 289, 308; Adams's <i>Familiar Letters</i>, 208,
220, 230. Abigail Adams wrote, Sept. 9, 1776,
"The rage for privateering is as great here as
anywhere, and I believe the success has been as
great" (<i>Familiar Letters</i>, 226). The <i>Massachusetts
Archives</i> show how large the number of
privateers was that hailed from that State. Cf.
<i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 118, with references; and
the <i>Report on the Mass. Archives</i> (1885), pp. 25,
27-29, 31, 34. Cf. a letter of Thomas Cushing
on the building of armed vessels in Mass., in
<i>Penna. Mag. of Hist.</i>, Oct., 1886, p. 355; and a
list by Admiral Preble of those fitted out in
Massachusetts, 1776-1783, in <i>N. E. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg.</i>, Oct., 1871. After Boston, the most
activity was in Salem. Cf. extracts from <i>Salem
Gazette</i>, quoted in A. B. Ellis's <i>Amer. Patriotism

"Gen. Washington", in E. M. Stone's <i>Our French

Newport is thought to have furnished more
seamen than any port except Boston.</p>

Island Sound, see <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, March,
1882, p. 168; <i>N. Y. Evening Post</i>, July 18, 1853

170-234. Cf. also F. M. Caulkins's <i>New London</i>,
ch. 31; Hinman's <i>Conn. during the Rev.</i>, 592.
The British expedition to Danbury was offset by
the incursion of Connecticut whale-boats (May,
1777), under Return Jonathan Meigs, to Sag
Harbor, where captures were made and shipping
burned. Cf. Hildreth's <i>Pioneer Settlers of
Ohio</i>, 532; Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, iv. 440; <i>Mag.
of American History</i>, April, 1880. Judge Jones
(<i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i>) asperses Meigs's character,
and Johnston (<i>Observations</i>, etc., 23) defends
him.</p>

<p>For those of New York, see <i>N. Y. City Manual</i>,
1870, p. 867. We know less about the privateers
fitted out south of New York; but Robert
Morris is said to have grown rich on the
profits of such enterprises (Chastellux's <i>Voyages</i>,
Eng. tr., i. 199, etc.). These ventures were far
from uniformly successful, and the losses were
many (cf. such instances as are detailed in
Moore's <i>Diary</i>, i. 284, 316, etc.), but the losses
inflicted by privateers on the British were vastly
greater. Lecky (iv. 17) thinks that, though the
allurements of such service helped to stay enlistments
in the army, it was quite worth such a
cost in the damage which the British suffered.</p>

<p>Congress first authorized privateers under
Continental commissions March 23, 1776, and
regulations were adopted April 2d and 3d,&mdash;Washington
having made suggestions (<i>Journals</i>,
i. 183, 296, 305; John Adams's <i>Works</i>, iii. 37).
A collection of <i>Extracts from the Journals of
Congress relative to prizes and privateers</i> was
printed at Philad. in 1777 (Brinley, no. 4,112).
For prize claims, see Poore's <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i>
p. 1347; and for lists of prize cases, cf.
<i>Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc.</i>, 2d ser., ii. 120.</p>

<p>Respecting the international complications occasioned
by the privateers, see the <i>Diplom. Corresp.
of the Rev.</i> Capt. John Lee, of Marblehead,
carried some prisoners taken from prizes, which
he had sent home, into Bilbao in 1776, where
he was put under arrest; but the news of the
Declaration of Independence arriving at Madrid,
he was discharged (George Sumner's <i>Oration at
Boston</i>, July 4, 1859, p. 12; <i>Dipl. Corresp.</i>, i. 53).
The Grantham correspondence, copied in the
<i>Sparks MSS.</i> (no. xxiii.), shows much on these
complications. The histories of American diplomacy
in Europe at this time necessarily cover
these points; and the copies of the Lord Stormont
and Sir Joseph Yorke Papers, among the
Sparks MSS., show the complications which the
ministers of England had to encounter in France
and Holland. E. E. Hale's <i>Franklin in France</i>
has a chapter on the American privateers sailing
from Dunkirk. On the participancy of Franklin
and Deane in the movements of the privateers,
see Parton's <i>Franklin</i>, ii. 239. There were
instances of privateers being retaken by their
prisoners and carried into England (P. O. Hutchinson's
<i>Gov. Hutchinson</i>, ii. 86).</p>

Bay had been fortified, except the westerly, or
that one lying between Conanicut Island and
the western shore of the bay; and accordingly, in
December of that year, Sir Peter Parker with a
British fleet entered by this passage, and, passing
round the northern end of Conanicut, landed
Sir Henry Clinton and a force of British and
Hessians on Rhode Island, and occupied Newport
(<i>New Hampshire State Papers</i>, viii. 411,
431; Bancroft, ix. 200, 357. Cf. G. C. Mason
on the English fleet in R. I. in the <i>R. I. Hist.
Soc. Coll.</i>, vii. 301). The <i>Journals</i> of Congress,
ii. 233, show a proposition to send fire-ships
against the British in August, 1777. The Americans,
under the direction of a French engineer,
Malmedy, completed at once the defences of all
vulnerable points round the bay, and the chart
of the bay, made by the English engineer Blaskowitz
in 1777, shows what some of these points
were. The American as well as the British
defences are enumerated in Gen. George W.
Cullum's <i>Historical sketch of the fortification defences
of Narragansett Bay</i> (Washington, 1884).
Cf. also his paper in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, June,
1884. A section of Blaskowitz's map of the bay,
1777, given in E. M. Stone's <i>French Allies</i>, shows

<p>D'Estaing, by reason of the draft of his heavier
ships, had declined to risk entering New York
harbor (Sparks, <i>Corresp. of the Rev.</i>, ii. 155;
<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, iii. 387). A sketch in the
Montresor Papers (<i>N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll., 1881</i>,
p. 505) gives the positions of the English and
French fleets, July 22, 1778, respectively, within
and without Sandy Hook. When D'Estaing
sailed to Newport, it was in pursuance of a plan
contrived with Washington for the capture of
that place and the British forces there. On July
29, 1778, D'Estaing anchored near Point Judith.
Sullivan was now in command of about ten
thousand men, largely militia, and under him were
Greene and Lafayette commanding divisions, and
they all were gathered about the head of the bay.
Copies of Lafayette's letters during this campaign,
made by him for Sparks, are in the <i>Sparks
MSS.</i> no. lxxxiv. There were about 6,000 men
under Maj.-Gen. Pigot in the Newport defences.
On Newport in the hands of the British, see <i>Hist.
Mag.</i>, iv. 1, 34, 69, 105, 133, 172, and the Journal
in <i>Narragansett Hist. Reg.</i>, i. 28, 91, 167, 277.
There was a small British fleet, mostly of thirty-two
guns each, protecting their water-front.
When on August 5 D'Estaing began to send his
ships in, the British burned or sunk their ships.
The plan agreed upon by the joint forces was
to attack the British on August 10; but Sullivan
had crossed his troops over to the island earlier
than D'Estaing expected, since he found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
Pigot was drawing in his troops from the northern
end of the island, and massing them nearer
Newport, while the French troops had not yet
landed so as to be ready to act in concert. This
was the condition, when one morning, as the fog
lifted, the English fleet of Howe was seen off
the entrance of the bay. Some of the French
ships were outside and exposed, and so D'Estaing
promptly passed out to keep his fleet together
and present his strongest front. Howe declined
battle, because the French had the weather-gauge.
A gale coming on, both fleets sought
sea-room and were widely scattered, so that little
fighting took place except as opposing vessels
chanced to come together. The storm damaged
both fleets equally, and each commander sought
a harbor as best he could; Howe at New York,
and D'Estaing at Newport.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on August 15, Sullivan began a
movement down the island, and the British retired
behind their two lines of defences. When
D'Estaing reëntered the bay on the 20th, Sullivan
had begun his approaches against the British
works, but not wisely in plan, as General Cullum
says. Sullivan urged D'Estaing to join in the
attack; but that officer thought that his first
duty, under his instructions, was to make the
safety of his fleet sure, and accordingly did not
dare risk, in his shattered condition, an attack
from Howe, should the English admiral chance
to have fared better in the gale, and have made
ready to fall upon him. So D'Estaing told
Sullivan he must go to Boston to refit, and on
the 22d he set sail, expressing regret that Sullivan
had been so precipitate in passing over from
the main. He declared that he could not help
the American general, and this purpose he insisted
upon, despite the protests of Sullivan and
his officers. The predicament of the American
commander was certainly an unfortunate one,
but he was not steady enough of head to refrain
from publicly casting reproach on the French
general, in an order which he found he must in
part recall after the mischief had been done
(Lodge's <i>Hamilton's Works</i>, vii. 557. Cf. Lafayette's
letter to Washington in Sparks's <i>Corresp.
of the Rev.</i>, ii., Aug. 25; and a letter of Greene,
in <i>Ibid.</i>, Aug. 28; also Greene's <i>Greene</i>, iii. 148).
Sullivan thus gave the militia an excuse for deserting
him. While in front of the British works
and in this condition, Sullivan got intelligence
from Washington that Clinton had sailed from
New York with reinforcements for Pigot. Beginning
a retrograde movement on the 26th, Sullivan
stopped at the northern end of the island
and strengthened his position, while Lafayette
made a fruitless visit to Boston to induce D'Estaing
to return. That officer was not yet ready;
his ships not yet repaired.</p>

<p class="pf400">The contemporary English engraved maps of Narragansett Bay of the most importance are those published
by Des Barres and Faden. That of Des Barres is called <i>A chart of the harbour of Rhode Island and Narreganset
Bay, published at the request of the Right Honourable Lord Viscount Howe, by F. F. W. Des
Barres, 20 July, 1776</i>, in two sheets, which subsequently made part of the <i>Atlantic Neptune</i>. It bears the
following "Notes and references explaining the situation of the British ships and forces after the 29th of
July, 1778, when the French fleet under the command of Count D'Estaing appeared and anchored off the
harbour. The same day two French frigates went up the Seakonnet Passage. July 30th two French line-of-battle
ships anchored in the Narraganset Passage, on which the king's troops quitted Connanicut Island.
Aug. 5th the French ships came towards Dyer's Island where the British advanced frigates were destroyed and
the seamen encamped. 8th, the rest of the French fleet came into harbour and anchored abreast of Gold
Island [small island south of Providence Island], upon which the king's troops withdrew within the lines [north
of Newport]. 9th, the enemy's forces landed." It places the sinking and burning of the "Alarm" (10
guns), "Cerberus" (28), "Juno" (32), "Kingfisher" (18), "Lark" (32), "Orpheus" (32), "Pigot" (8),
"Spitfire" (8), "Flora" (32), and "Falcon" (18).</p>

<p class="pf400">The Faden map was published July 22, 1777, and is entitled <i>A Topographical Chart of the Bay of Narraganset,
in the Province of New England, with all the Isles contained therein, among which Rhode Island
and Connonicut have been particularly surveyed ... to which have been added the several Works and
Batteries raised by the Americans, taken by order of the Principal Farmers on Rhode Island, by Charles
Blaskowitz</i>.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc400">RHODE ISLAND, <span class="smcap">August, 1778.</span></p>
       <p class="pf400">Sketched from a colored plan among the Sparks maps at Cornell University, which follows a plan made
for Lafayette. It is called <i>Plan de Rhode Island avec les différentes opérations de la flotte Française, et
des troupes Américaines, commandées par le Major Général Sullivan, contre les forces de terre et de mer
des Anglais, depuis le 9 Août, jusqu'à la nuit du 30 au 31 du même mois, 1778, que les Américains ont
fait leur Retraite</i>.</p>

<p class="pf400"><span class="smcap">Key</span>: The British works are solid black, their troops diagonally black and white; the American works of
open lines, and their troops shaded obliquely. The British in Newport were protected on the water side by
batteries (3, 3, 3); on the land side by an inner line of defence (4) and an outer line (5, 6, 7, 8), with nine guns
(8) commanding the water approach by Easton Pond. At the north end of the island they had works (16, 18,
20,&mdash;solid black) to resist attack from the mainland. Upon the entrance of the French fleet by the Newport
batteries, the English evacuated these advanced posts, and some frigates were sent into the East passage (15)
to protect the movements of the Americans, who, moving over to the island, threw up redoubts (17) to protect
their first position, and erected a battery of two guns at 20 to cover their retreat across Howland's Ferry,
should that become necessary. They now advanced, and on August 15th took position on the line 11, and
began their approaches (9). The French had landed from the ships at 22, and joined the left wing under
Lafayette. The redoubts on the extreme left and right of the line 11 were never completed. The fire from
the parallels was kept up from the 19th to the evening of the 28th, when the retreat began, and the Americans
in the night of the 28th, erected the breastworks (19, 19) flanking the abandoned British forts (18), and during
the night of the 30th left the island by Howland's Ferry, while the British were at Turkey Hill (16). The
position of the British fleet was at 1.</p>

<p class="pf400">Sparks has added to the plan these references: 12, Overing's house, where Col. Barton captured Gen. Prescott;
13, guard-house; 14, round redoubt thrown up by the New Hampshire militia,&mdash;skirmishing commenced
here under Col. Laurens; and 10, Bishop Berkeley's house. The broken lines are roads.</p>

<p class="pf400">The most elaborate of the manuscript contemporary maps is one belonging to the Mass. Hist. Society, which
is reproduced, full size, in the <i>Proceedings</i> of that society (vol. xx. p. 350), and is given in its essential parts
in Gen. G. W. Cullum's <i>Historical Sketch of the Fortification Defences of Narragansett Bay</i> (Washington,
1884). It is on a scale of nearly an inch and a quarter to the mile, and is signed "J. Denison scripsit." The
French fleet is represented as going out to join battle with Lord Howe's fleet, exchanging shots with the English
shore batteries, which are more numerous than in the Lafayette map. The French ships in the East passage
are shown as sailing out to sea, to join D'Estaing on his way to Boston. In the battle of the 29th, near
Butt's Hill, English ships are drawn as engaging both the American right and a battery on the Bristol shore.
The first line of the Americans stretches across the island in this order from west to east,&mdash;Livingston, Varnum,
Cornell, Greene, Glover, Tyler. These are without the breastworks. Behind them are Lovell at the
west, Titcomb between the abandoned British forts, with a reserve under West behind them.</p>

against the British fleet in New York, captured

and made his subsequent record on the
water as an officer of the navy. Henry T. Tuckerman
wrote the <i>Life of Silas Talbot</i>, which had
been intended for Sparks's <i>Amer. Biography</i>,
but was published separately in N. Y. in 1850.
Cf. Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 849.</p>

<p>The next morning Clinton's reinforcements
appeared, brought by Howe's fleet. They were
not needed; and so, while Gen. Grey made
some raids, with transports and light craft, upon
Fairhaven and other ports, whose privateers
had annoyed the British (cf. <i>Harper's Monthly
Mag.</i>, 1885, p. 823; and statement of losses in
<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, lii. vol. ii. 29), Clinton took his
troops back to New York, and Howe went
round Cape Cod and cruised off Boston harbor,
trying in vain to allure D'Estaing to battle.
The French commander remained in port
till November. As the time for his sailing approached,
another English fleet, under Admiral
Byron, appeared off the harbor; but a storm
scattering his ships, the French, on the 3d of
November, left the port unmolested, and sailed
for the West Indies.</p>

<p>D'Estaing, while in Boston, addressed a letter
to Congress (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, lii. vol. iii.), and
promulgated a proclamation (Oct. 28th) to former
French subjects in Canada, seeking to detach
them from English interests (Andrews's
<i>Late War</i>, iii. 171; Niles's <i>Principles</i>, 1876 ed.,
p. 136, <i>Doc. rel. to Col. Hist., N. Y.</i>, x. 1165).</p>

<p>The reports which reached Boston relative
to the campaign under Sullivan, and the impressions
respecting the French, are given in
Ezekiel Price's diary (<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal.
Reg.</i>, Oct., 1865, p. 334). Hancock, who had
been in command of the Massachusetts militia
during the campaign, returned to Boston to do
what he could by his hospitality to prevent the
general indifference of the Boston people producing
evil effects on the French (<i>Memorial Hist.
Boston</i>, iii. 185; Loring's <i>Hundred Boston Orators</i>,
102; Adams's <i>Familiar Letters</i>, 342; Greene's
<i>Greene</i>, ii. 143). On the unfortunate riot (Sept.
17, 1778) in the town, in which the French were
roughly handled, see <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, viii.
785, 856, xv. 95. Considerable apprehension was
felt lest the British, elated by success, should
push towards Boston from Rhode Island, and
beacons were got in readiness (Sept. 7th) on
Blue Hill in Milton. A regiment of artillery
had been raised for the defence of the town,
and an orderly-book covering its service, June
8, 1777, to Dec. 18, 1778, is given in the <i>Essex
Inst. Hist. Coll.</i>, xiii. 115, 237; xiv. 60, 110, 188.
Heath (cf. his <i>Memoirs</i> for this period), at a
time when the French were making ready to sail,
wrote from Boston, Oct. 22, 1778, to Weare, of
New Hampshire, that he feared the British were
planning an attack by water (<i>Letters and Papers,
MSS.</i>, 1777-1780, in Mass. Hist. Soc. cabinet).</p>

<p class="p1">IV. <span class="smcap">The Penobscot Expedition, 1779.</span>&mdash;This
expedition was fitted out in Boston by the
Massachusetts authorities, with some assistance
from New Hampshire, for the purpose of dislodging
a British force, which in June, under General
McNeill, supported by a few vessels under Captain
Mowatt, had taken possession of the peninsula
now called Castine. The treasury of Massachusetts
issued bills to cover the cost (Goodell's
<i>Province Laws</i>, v. 1191).</p>

<p>Solomon Lovell
was put in command of 1,200 militia and 100
artillery, while Peleg Wadsworth was second in
command, and Paul Revere had charge of the
artillery. The general government lent the
"Warren" and "Providence", Continental vessels,
and Dudley Saltonstall, a Continental officer,
commanded the fleet. The expedition, consisting
of nineteen armed vessels, of three hundred
and twenty-four guns, with twenty transports,
and 2,000 men in all, left Boston harbor
July 19th. Quarrels between Lovell and Saltonstall
prevented prompt action, and before success
could be insured the expedition was overcome
by a naval force which Clinton had sent from
New York when he heard of the undertaking.

<p>Lovell's troops and the seamen struggled in
disorder through the Maine wilderness, and the
general himself reached Boston about Sept. 20th.
A court of inquiry, under Gen. Artemas Ward,
exonerated Lovell, and blamed Saltonstall. Nash
prints its report, which is preserved in the <i>Mass.
Archives</i>, vol. cxiv. It is examined by Eben
Hazard in a letter printed in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i>, iv. 129, in which he intimates that the
blame was not all the naval commander's, and
that it was a part of the plan to throw the responsibility
on a Continental officer, in order to
force the cost of the expedition upon Congress.</p>

<p>The annexed sketch is a combination of the
two maps on a much larger scale in Calef's <i>Siege
of Penobscot</i> (London, 1781). On the approach
of the American fleet up the river, the British
garrison was encamped on the peninsula of Maja-big-waduce
(the modern Castine) at Q, and their
main fortification, Fort George (A), was not completed.
Capt. Mowatt, the naval commander,
placed his three vessels in line (L) to defend the
harbor. The Americans were first seen July
24th. On the 25th the American transports
passed up the river and anchored, while nine
armed ships in three divisions at K attacked the
British ships at L; the American land forces,
meanwhile, attempting to land at R, were repulsed.
On the 26th, towards night, the Americans
placed some heavy guns on Nautilus Island,
whereupon the British ships moved back to a
position at M. On the 27th the American ships
engaged the British battery D with little result.
On the 28th the Americans succeeded in landing
at R, captured the battery D, and established
the lines C. The battery on Nautilus Island
disturbing the ships at M, they moved farther
up to N. On the 29th the Americans opened
their batteries along the lines C, and the British
moved some guns from the half-moon E to the
fort, and the ships sent ashore some cannon to
be mounted at E. On the 31st the American
seamen and marines attempted a landing between
D and E, but were repulsed. On August 4th
the Americans opened a battery at G, annoying
the ships at N, and endangering their communications
with the forts. The American batteries
at F and H were not completed, and the
one at H was abandoned on August 9th. On
August 5th the British naval commander began
the battery B to protect his communications with
the fort; and while building it, the
Americans planted, on the 8th, a field-piece
at F to annoy the men working.</p>

<p>On the 13th arrangements were
making for a vigorous attack, when
the reinforcing British fleet appeared
in the offing. During the night the
Americans reëmbarked, and all their
vessels fled up the river. Only the
"Hunter" and "Hampden" attempted
to escape down the river, and these
were captured. Night coming on, the British
anchored; while the Americans landed their
men, and then blew up their vessels. The commodore's
ship, "Warren", of thirty-two guns,
was burned at Oak Point.</p>

<p>Calef's map is given in Wheeler's <i>Pentagoet</i>.
A MS. plan of the operations of the English
fleet is among the Faden maps (no. 101), in the
library of Congress. As a result of their success
at Penobscot, the British government, the next
year, attempted to erect Maine into a province
under the name of New Ireland (Bancroft, x. 368;
Barry's <i>Mass.; Me. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, vii. 201).</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">THE INDIANS AND THE BORDER WARFARE OF THE
REVOLUTION.</p>

<p class="pc1">BY ANDREW McFARLAND DAVIS,</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>American Antiquarian Society.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE peace which followed the quelling of the Pontiac war gave
opportunities for settlements to be pushed westward. The population
on the border, rendered lawless by environment, was not likely to
observe treaties. Fear of the Indians was more potent to restrain these
restless men than dread of punishment by colonial authorities. Conflicts
of colonial jurisdiction and disputed land claims added to the chronic
confusion of the situation.</p>

<p>It needed all the tact and discretion of which that remarkable man, Sir
William Johnson, was master to prevent outbreaks, and the danger was
not over until the boundaries were adjusted with the Six Nations and
other Indians, at Fort Stanwix, in 1768. There was far more cause for
complaint against the English on the part of the tribes whom Sir William
was able to control than on the part of the Senecas, who, in September,
1763, had surprised and scalped a working party with their guard. Encroachment
upon their lands had also irritated the Mohawks, who particularly
resented an attempt of a Connecticut company to colonize the
valley of the Susquehanna. Early in the spring of 1763, the Connecticut
company sought to secure Sir William's influence with the Indians in quieting
the company's title, which was based upon the Connecticut charter and
upon alleged Indian deeds. The company failed in this, as well as in an
attempt to negotiate with the confederacy. The Indians, instead of granting
a deed, sent to Connecticut a delegation of Mohawks, accompanied by
Guy Johnson, to represent to the governor of that colony the peril with
which further attempts at colonization would be attended.<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> These efforts
arrested the movements of the company, and for the time immigration was
checked. They were not early enough, however, to prevent one of those
horrible attacks which stand out in our memories as types of Indian warfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
and which in the minds of many readers obscure all other conceptions of
Indian character. A number of families had already settled in this region,
under the auspices of the Connecticut company, and had built themselves
homes near the present site of Wilkesbarré. On October 15, 1763, they
were suddenly attacked by Indians, and one woman and nine men were
killed and scalped. The rest of the inhabitants fled to the mountains, and
such as did not perish worked their way through the wilderness to the
nearest settlements. Their villages were destroyed, their cattle killed, and
their crops laid waste. Avenging expeditions were promptly organized
in Pennsylvania. One marched to the Delaware town at Wyoming, but
found it deserted. Another laid waste the Delaware and Munsee towns
on the west branch of the Susquehanna.</p>

<p>The Moravian Indians at Wyoming, who had taken no part in the massacre
of the Connecticut settlers, removed for safety to Gnadenhütten,
whence they were taken to Philadelphia for greater security. At Paxton,
Pennsylvania, the inhabitants assembled secretly, and attacked a settlement
of the harmless Conestogoes. The cause for this wicked slaughter
has never been clearly explained,<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> but the subsequent memorials of the
rioters seem to indicate that it was part of a general plan to exterminate
the Indians. Whatever the motive, popular approval was strong enough
to shield the perpetrators of such shameless deeds.<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> The entire band of
the Conestogoes was exterminated,<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> and their town was destroyed. The
first attack was made on them on the night of the 14th of December, when
this band of murderers surrounding the town, killed all who happened
to be there. Those Indians who were absent took refuge in Lancaster,
where they were lodged in a public building, spoken of by some as the
workhouse, by some as the jail. On the 27th, their enemies followed them
to this refuge, and in cold blood slaughtered them all, men, women, and
children, indiscriminately.</p>

<p>The Moravian Indians, who had taken refuge at Philadelphia, were next
threatened by the rioters, who marched towards that place with the avowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
intention of killing them also. The provincial authorities appealed to
General Gage for help, but before his reply reached them they sought to
throw the Indians upon New York for protection. It happened that a
company of regulars was about to march from Philadelphia for New York,
and under their escort the Indians were dispatched, with intention to place
them under charge of Sir William Johnson. The New York authorities
refused, however, to permit the Indians to enter that province. Meantime
General Gage placed troops at the disposal of Governor Penn. The Indians
were conducted back to Philadelphia, and orders were given to repel
by force any attack. The rioters again approached Philadelphia, but were
dissuaded from attack, and Pennsylvania was spared the shame of further
atrocities by the "Paxton Boys."</p>

<p>After this excitement was over the labors of Sir William Johnson to
prevent renewed conflict were still constant. He complained, in his correspondence,<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a>
of murders, robberies, and encroachments on the rights and
possessions of the natives. The frontier inhabitants, according to him,
thought themselves at liberty to make settlements where they pleased.
He lost heart, while on the other hand the settlers openly bade defiance to
authority. In 1766 he wrote: "Murders are now daily committed on the
frontiers, and I fear that an Indian war is inevitable." In January, 1767,
he announced that Colonel Cresap, of Maryland, himself held a treaty
some time during the last year with several warriors of the Six Nations,
who passed that way, and who were persuaded to grant to him a considerable
tract of land down the Ohio toward Green-Brier. With prophetic
instinct, Sir William added: "If this be true, it will be productive of
dangerous consequences." A large part of Johnson's time was spent in
protecting the Indians from such fraudulent conveyances of their land
as were made through transfers where there was but a shadow of title,
through forgeries, and through deeds executed without proper formalities,
under circumstances which would prevent recognition of the transaction
by the tribes. Many deeds, which upon the face seemed properly executed,
were secured from the signers when they were so completely
intoxicated that they were ignorant what they were doing. Others conveyed
by metes and bounds an extent of territory far exceeding the
intention of the grantors. No transfer of land made by a band of warriors,
on the war-path or on a hunting expedition, would have been recognized by
the confederacy. Sir William himself said: "A sachem of each tribe is a
necessary party to a fair conveyance, and such sachem affixes the mark of
the tribe thereto, as a public seal of a corporation." The title to the land
was supposed to be in all. Even the women had a voice in transfers by
bargain and sale.<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> It was one of the principal occupations of Sir William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
Johnson's life to adjust difficulties arising out of transfers, such as the one
to Cresap, of which he had heard, and in which he saw the seeds of future
trouble, if it should prove to be true. In his review of the trade and affairs
of the Indians in the northern district of America, he recapitulates the
wrongs of the Indian.<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a></p>

<p>Life in the midst of such impending dangers bred contempt for authority,
even on the part of men who were well disposed. The strong arm
of the government was but feebly felt in the distant bottoms in the
western parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, which settlers were
beginning to appropriate to their own use. The inhabitants of the frontiers
were a law unto themselves, and sometimes unto the authorities.
Men who diligently read their Bibles and pondered over the teachings of
the gospels could tear scalps from the heads of Indians. The government
was powerless to protect the frontiers except through the agency of volunteers,
and they in turn were able at any moment seriously to complicate
the situation. In the organization of companies of rangers the weakness
of the government was exposed, and through them the independence of
the settlers was developed. Such companies frequently adopted Indian
costumes, painted their faces, and manœuvred by Indian tactics. The
habits of the Indian more than the civilization they had left, influenced
their modes of life. They attacked for revenge, and were barbarous
because the savages were. In the case of the Indians such methods in
warfare came by inheritance. They were modified somewhat by the spirit
of the missionaries, and however cruel they may have been, they were at
any rate absolutely free from assaults on woman's chastity. In the case of
the settlers, the promptings of civilization were disregarded, and it would
seem as if the system of bounties for scalps had taught them to regard the
Indian as on the level of a brute. Nevertheless, the rule had exceptions;
and it would not be just to paint all the settlers along the borders in these
repulsive colors, or to believe that there was a universal desire for the
extermination of the Indians.</p>

<p>This hazardous contact of Indian and border settler stretched along a
doubtful line which extended from Oneida Lake to the central part of the
valley of the Ohio. In 1768 the boundaries were adjusted at Fort Stanwix,
between representatives of the English government, on the one part,
and the Six Nations, the Delawares, the Shawanese, the Mingoes of Ohio,
and other dependent tribes, on the other. A deed of the land to the east
and south of a line which ran from a point just west of Fort Stanwix south
to the Susquehanna, thence up the West Branch and across to Kittanning
on the Alleghany, thence down that river and the Ohio to the mouth of
the Tennessee, was then duly executed to the king of England. An exception
from its terms was made of the land occupied by the Mohawks,
whose settlements were all to the east of the agreed boundary line. The
hunting-grounds comprised within the limits of the States of Kentucky
and Tennessee were claimed by the Six Nations as conquered territory,
and they paid no regard to the claims of the Cherokees, who had arranged
a boundary with Stuart, the Indian agent, to a part at least of the same
region, the northern termination of which was the mouth of the Kanawha
River. It was understood by the Indians that no white man was to settle
to the west of the line agreed upon.<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span></p>

<p>The far-reaching influence of the Indian superintendents restrained this
aboriginal population from violent outbreak from 1764 until the collision at
Point Pleasant, Virginia, in 1774. This was undoubtedly precipitated by
atrocities committed upon the Indians in the Ohio Valley, near Wheeling.
Underlying the immediate causes for irritation during this period were
reasons for complaint, revealed in the correspondence of Sir William Johnson,
which would probably have led to warfare at an early date. Among
these was the influx of settlers upon the hunting-grounds of the Indians,
where, regardless of treaties, the land across the Ohio was parcelled out in
"tomahawk improvements", as the squatter rights of the day were denominated.
These proceedings attracted the attention of General Gage, and
on the 8th of August, 1772, he issued a proclamation, calling attention to
the fact that some persons had "undertaken to make settlements beyond
the boundaries fixed by treaties made with the Indian nations", "where
they lead a wandering life, without government and without laws", "causing
infinite disturbance." Such persons were ordered to "quit these
countries instantly and without delay, and to retire at their choice into
some one of the colonies of his majesty." The peace which was negotiated
by Lord Dunmore brought but little quiet to the settlers on the border.
Indian raids were frequent, and the details of their horrors are sickening,
but the loss of life by these raids has been greatly exaggerated. The Indians
seldom ventured beyond the region which was scantily peopled. The
watchfulness of the settlers, and their promptness to assemble and pursue,
averted many disasters. At such a time Virginia and Pennsylvania were
wrangling over the right to grant patents for land, the settlement of which
had so much to do with the uneasiness of the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a></p>

<p>In New York, settlements were more compact. Rights of territory were
better defined and better understood. Indian lands had been better protected
there from direct invasion and from fraudulent transfer. Danger
from trespass was better appreciated. The Indians themselves, being under
the personal oversight of their superintendent, were better controlled. His
immediate presence made him more useful in the adjustment of disputes
without resort to the tomahawk. The frontier patriots of Tryon County,
"unlike the rude inhabitants of most frontier settlements", are stated by a
careful student of the records to have been "scrupulous in their devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
to the supremacy of the laws." The confederacy of the Six Nations, as a
whole, had not participated in the events in the valley of the Ohio, but
they shared with their dependants and allies in the uneasiness caused by
such aggressions upon Indian territory. Some of their warriors had taken
part in the Virginia war, and the "temper of the whole Indian race, with
the exception of the Oneidas, was soured by these occurrences of the year
1774." The first official labors of importance which devolved upon Colonel
Guy Johnson, who, after the death of Sir William Johnson in 1774, had
been appointed to the office of superintendent, were to check the resentment
of the Six Nations.<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> His success in those labors showed that he had
inherited, by virtue of his office, some of the respect and affection which
the natives had lavished upon his predecessor.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of affairs when Washington took command of
the army, in July, 1775, with instructions not to disband any of the forces
already raised, until further directions from Congress. It is not probable
that all the members of the Congress were aware of the full meaning of
these instructions. There were among the men whom Washington was
thus instructed not to discharge a number of Indians regularly enlisted as
minute-men. Had the question of employing Indians been submitted to
Congress at that time, it would probably have been answered in the negative;
but it had already been settled by the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts
Bay when they accepted the services of Indians.<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a></p>

<p>On the first day of April, 1775, the Committee on the State of the Province
reported to that congress a resolve beginning with these words: "Whereas
a number of Indians, natives of the town of Stockbridge, have enlisted as
minute-men." A committee was next appointed to draft a letter to the
Rev. Mr. Kirkland,<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> and to frame an address to the chief of the Mohawk
tribes. The letter requests Mr. Kirkland to use his influence with the Six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
Nations "to join with us in the defence of our rights;" but if he could not
"prevail with them to take an active part in this glorious cause", he was
"at least to engage them to stand neuter." The address calls upon the
Indians to "whet their hatchet, and be prepared to defend our liberties
and lives."</p>

<p>It is evident that the Stockbridge Indians were further importuned,<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> for
on the 11th of April their chief sachem answered a communication from
the President of the Provincial Congress (the contents of which can only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
be conjectured) by offering to visit the Six Nations and find out how they
stood. "If I find that they are against you", he said, "I will try and
turn their minds."... "One thing I ask of you, if you send for me to
fight, that you will let me fight in my own Indian way." The Massachusetts
Congress also tried to draw recruits from the Indians of Nova
Scotia, and addressed them on the 15th of May, 1775,<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> as their "friends
and good brothers;" adding as an inducement for their enlistment that
"the Indians at Stockbridge all join with us, and some of their men have
enlisted as soldiers." Captain John Lane was sent down among these
Eastern Indians to raise one company of their men, "to join with us in
the war with your and our enemies." Nothing, however, resulted from
this, except the arrival in June of Captain Lane with one chief and three
young men, and at a later date the execution of a barren treaty.<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> In
addition to these efforts put forth by the Provincial Congress, attempts
were early made in the same direction by provincial officers;<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> and thus by
general or special effort at the very beginning of the war, the Americans
secured the services of such Indians as were willing to enlist, and the
English followed so close in their steps as to confound, to the casual
observer of their mutual criminations, the evidence of priority. The Indians
engaged upon the American side produced no material influence upon
military movements. Their presence in camp has been ignored by many
writers. The responsibility for the intention is the same as if the effort
had been successful. It must, however, be remembered that small bodies
of Indians, serving with whites, were controllable and easily restrained
from excesses. After the evacuation of Boston, the tide of events changed
the field of war, and altered the composition of the troops. The army
began to assume a national aspect. The voice of Massachusetts was no
longer pre-eminent in military affairs.</p>

<p>The Continental Congress contained representatives of other colonies
who keenly felt the dangers from the use of Indians by the enemy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
expressions of opinion in that body were, therefore, much more conservative
than in the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts Bay. On the 18th of May
it appears by the <i>Journals</i> that indubitable evidence of a design formed
by the British ministry of making an invasion had been received. In
June, according to the <i>Secret Journals</i>, Governor Carleton was making
preparation to invade the colonies, and was "instigating the Indian nations
to take up the hatchet against them." On the 30th the Committee on
Indian Affairs was instructed "to prepare proper talks to the several
tribes of Indians for engaging the continuance of their friendship to us,
and neutrality in our present unhappy dispute with Great Britain." On the
1st of July there is a hint of a possible change of position shown in the
passage of a resolution, "that in case any agent of the ministry shall
induce any Indian tribes, or any of them, to commit actual hostilities
against these colonies, or to enter into an offensive alliance with the British
troops, thereupon the colonies ought to avail themselves of an alliance with
such Indian nations as will enter into the same, to oppose such British
troops and their allies." The statement that Carleton was instigating the
Indians to "fall upon us" was repeated July 6th.<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> On July 12th the Committee
on Indian Affairs recommended that the country be divided into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
three Indian departments, and that commissioners be appointed, with power
to "treat with the Indians in their respective departments, in the name and
on behalf of the United Colonies, in order to preserve peace and friendship
with the said Indians, and to prevent their taking any part in the present
commotion." This recommendation was adopted. On July 13th, a formal
speech was addressed to the Six Confederate Nations, urging them to keep
peace. On the 17th the commissioners were recommended to employ Mr.
Kirkland, in order to secure the friendship of the Indians and continue
them in a state of neutrality. On July 21st a plan of confederation was
submitted to Congress by Franklin, in which "a perpetual alliance, offensive
and defensive", was proposed, "to be entered into as soon as may be
with the Six Nations." On December 2d it was resolved that the Indians
of the St. Francis, Penobscot, Stockbridge, and St. John and other tribes
may be called on in case of real necessity, and that giving them presents is
suitable and proper. On March 8, 1776, the growing disposition to make
use of Indians found expression in a resolve "that Indians be not employed
as soldiers in the armies of the United Colonies, before the tribes to which
they belong shall, in a national council, held in the customary manner,
have consented thereto, nor then without express approbation of Congress."
On May 25th the opposition seems to have been completely overcome,
when Congress resolved "that it is highly expedient to engage the Indians
in the service of the United Colonies."<a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> On June 3d authority was conferred
upon General Washington to employ in Canada a number of Indians,
not exceeding two thousand; and on the 6th instructions were given to
the standing Committee on Indian Affairs to devise ways and means for
carrying into effect the resolution of the 3d. Meantime the news of the
disaster at the Cedars was received, and its circumstances impelled Congress
to special efforts in behalf of the colonies. On June 14th the commissioners
of the Northern Department were instructed to "engage the Six
Nations in our interest, on the best terms that can be procured." On the
17th, the restriction in the resolution of the 3d, which limited to Canada
the use of the Indians to be raised, was removed, and the general was
permitted to employ them in any place where he should judge they would
be most useful. He was further authorized "to offer a reward of one
hundred dollars for every commissioned officer, and thirty dollars for every
private soldier of the king's troops, that they should take prisoners in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
Indian country, or on the frontiers of these colonies." The days of irresolution
were over. Congress was now irrevocably committed to the proposition
of permitting the general commanding the armies to take what
advantage he could of Indian auxiliaries, and to offer them bounties for
prisoners. The next utterance of Congress on this subject is to be found
in the Declaration of Independence, in which the king is arraigned because
"he has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless
Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished
destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions." This was closely followed
by a resolution on July 8th, authorizing Washington to call forth and
engage the Indians of the St. John, Nova Scotia, and Penobscot tribes.
The address to the people of Great Britain was adopted the same day.
The address to the people of Ireland, in which it is asserted that "the wild
and barbarous savages of the wilderness have been solicited by gifts to
take up the hatchet against us, and instigated to deluge our settlements
with the blood of defenceless women and children", was agreed to July
28, 1776.<a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> After this, the acts and resolutions of Congress were consistent
with the resolution in which they declared that it was highly expedient
to employ the Indians. Instructions were given from time to time to
secure the greatest advantage out of the services of the Indians, in behalf
of the country which was now struggling for independence; and in 1779
it was resolved that twelve blank commissions be furnished the commissioners
of the Northern Department for the appointment of as many
Indians, the name and the rank of each commission to be filled at the
discretion of the commissioners.<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a></p>

<p>The English approached the question differently; and there can be but
little doubt that the proposition to use Indian warriors was more shocking to
the cultivated Englishman, who was in no danger from their barbarous excesses,
than to the American of corresponding attainments, whose life had
been spent in close contact with men to whom such incidents had been
every-day experiences. The fierce invectives of Chatham,<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> in 1777, against
the ministry for having enlisted the services of Indians, were founded on a
proper estimate of the responsibilities of an invading army. Lord North
recognized this distinction when, in 1775, he said that Carleton raised
Indians only for purposes of defence. Military men knew that the natives,
who had taken part in every war in America between the French and
the English, must inevitably be drawn into any protracted contest between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
Great Britain and the colonies. It could be foreseen that, if the English
retained Canada and Detroit, operations would be conducted by way of
Lake Champlain, Oswego, and Detroit, which would involve the use of
Indian territory. If any inference could be drawn from the past, no armed
occupation of strategic positions within Indian territory, and no use of the
rivers and natural highways of the back country for military purposes during
a time of actual war, could be made without collision with the natives,
unless such occupation and use was by their consent. Such consent could
only be gained by alliance. General Gage and Lord Dunmore, both in
close contact with the situation, placed their opinions on record soon after
hostilities broke out. On June, 12, 1775, Gage wrote to Lord Dartmouth:
"I hear that the rebels, after surprising Ticonderoga, made incursions and
commenced hostilities upon the frontier of the province of Quebec, which
will justify General Carleton to raise bodies of Canadians and Indians to
attack them in return; and we need not be tender of calling on the savages,
as the rebels here have shown us the example, by bringing as many
Indians down here as they could collect." Lord Dunmore, whose indiscretions
and brutality were so serviceable in stamping out loyalty among men
of wealth and intelligence in Virginia, sought no justification in the example
of the rebels. He wrote to the Earl of Dartmouth, on May 1st, that
he hoped "to be able to collect from among Indians, negroes, and other persons
a force sufficient, if not to subdue rebellion, at least to defend government;"
and in the fall of the same year he endeavored to carry out his
policy.<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> Carleton was apparently averse to the employment of Indians in
aggressive movements. At any rate, he took refuge behind his orders,
which did not permit him "to act out of the line of the province."</p>

<p>Colonel Guy Johnson was the object of much suspicion during the months
of May and June, 1775. He repudiated with vigor the position which these
suspicions attributed to him, and said that he could not sufficiently express
his surprise at those who had, either through malice or ignorance, misconstrued
his intentions, and supposed him capable of setting Indians on the
peaceable inhabitants of Tryon County. He was a servant of the king and
an ardent loyalist. From the mere performance of his official duties he was
necessarily an object of suspicion to the Americans. He was the person
who furnished the natives with supplies. "We get our things from the
superintendent. If our ammunition is stopped we shall distrust you", said
an Indian speaker to the delegates from Albany and Tryon counties.
These supplies were furnished by the king to those whom he termed his
allies. It was evident that the king would not continue to furnish supplies,
if their only effect was to keep the neighboring Indians on good terms with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
colonists who, while claiming to be loyal subjects, were actually in arms
against his government. As the distributer of supplies, the safety of the
superintendent was of great importance to the natives, and a rumor that
the "Bostonians" contemplated seizing his person<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> caused the Indians
much alarm. Whether Johnson believed this rumor or not, he fortified his
house. This act, as well as his sudden removal to Fort Stanwix, and thence
to Oswego,&mdash;at both of which places he held conferences with Indians,&mdash;increased
the numbers who doubted the sincerity of his statements.
Yet even here, after these suspicious movements, he protested to the Provincial
Congress of New York against the charges brought against him:
"I trust I shall always manifest more humanity than to promote the destruction
of the innocent inhabitants of a colony to which I have been
always warmly attached." The conference at Oswego caused alarm to the
inhabitants of Tryon County, and the air was filled with rumors of Indian
invasion. Colonel Johnson reported to Dartmouth that he left home the
last of May, "having received secret instructions from General Gage", and
that he "assembled 1,458 Indians at Ontario,<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a> and adjusted matters with
them in such a manner that they agreed to defend the communications and
assist his majesty's troops in their operations." At the Albany conference
the Indians were interrogated about the proceedings at Oswego, and repeatedly
asserted that the superintendent's advice to them was to preserve
neutrality.<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a> The statements made by the Indians at the conferences were
generally to be relied upon. Johnson's language has perhaps been misunderstood.
The assistance "to his majesty's troops in their operations"
may have been limited to the agreement to defend the communications, the
military value of which Johnson appreciated, but the full effect of an agreement
to defend which the Indians did not comprehend. In the middle of
July, Johnson arrived at Montreal, and another conference was held with
1,664 Indians, at which their services were secured for the king. Brant,
who was present, afterwards said: "We immediately commenced in good
earnest, and did our utmost during the war."</p>

<p>In the South, John Stuart, the Indian superintendent of that department,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
was also an object of suspicion. At a hint from friends he fled from
Charleston to Savannah, and in turn to St. Augustine. From this spot, on
July 18th, he wrote to the Committee of Safety of Charleston, asserting
that he had never received any orders from his superiors "which, by the
most tortured suspicion, could be interpreted to stir up or employ the
Indians to fall upon the frontier inhabitants, or to take any part in the disputes
between Great Britain and the colonies."<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> A few weeks later he
received from Gage a letter written just before that officer left Boston, the
vindictiveness of which was probably prompted by anger. This letter contained
instructions to "improve a correspondence with the Indians to the
greatest advantage, and even when opportunity offers make them take arms
against his majesty's enemies, and distress them all in your power; for no
terms are now to be kept with them; they have brought down all the savages
they could against us here, who, with their riflemen, are continually
firing on our advanced sentries;<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> in short, no time should be lost to distress
a set of people so wantonly rebellious."<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> Stuart apparently proceeded
to carry out what he conceived to be the desires of his superior officer, and,
in a letter of October 3d, reported progress.</p>

<p>From England instructions were forwarded on July 5, 1775, by Lord
Dartmouth to Colonel Johnson, "to keep the Indians in such a state of
affection and attachment to the king as that his majesty may rely upon
their assistance in any case in which it may be necessary." On the 24th
Dartmouth wrote: "The intelligence his majesty has received of the rebels
having excited the Indians to take a part, and of their having actually engaged
a body of them in arms to support their rebellion, justifies the resolution
his majesty has taken of requiring the assistance of his faithful
adherents, the Six Nations. It is, therefore, his majesty's pleasure that
you do lose no time in taking such steps as may induce them to take up
the hatchet against his majesty's rebellious subjects in America, and to
engage them in his majesty's service, upon such plan as shall be suggested
by General Gage." This work Johnson had already accomplished even
before the instructions of July 24th were written. In the fall of the same
year that Dartmouth thus placed the British government on record as
willing to employ Indians in the war, without other restrictions than such
as were to be suggested by General Gage, the Earl of Shelburne, on information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
received, attacked the administration. "The Indians had been tampered
with", he said. "A trial of skill had been made to let the savages
on the back settlements loose on provincial subjects. Barbarous as was
the measure and cowardly as was the attempt, it had failed." This was on
November 10th. Ten days later Lord North asserted that, "as to the
means of conducting the war, there was never any idea of employing the
negroes or the Indians, until the Americans themselves had first applied to
them; that General Carleton did then apply to them; and even then it was
only for the defence of his own province." Lord North was not well
informed on proceedings in the colonies.</p>

<p>The attitude assumed by the British government in the order of July
24th represented the position which was retained during the remainder of
the war. From Halifax, on June 7, 1776, General Howe assured Lord
George Germain that his best endeavors would be used to engage the
Indians of the Six Nations, and he hoped by the influence of Colonel Guy
Johnson to make them useful. Notwithstanding the fact that the intercepted
correspondence between General Gage and John Stuart, the superintendent,
had been in possession of the Americans for some months,
Henry Stuart, a deputy of his brother, on May 18, 1776, asserted that it
was not the design of his majesty "to set his friends and allies on his liege
subjects." This was probably true, but there were a number of inhabitants
of the Southern colonies who could hardly have been classified as "liege
subjects" at that time, to whom this announcement could not have conveyed
much satisfaction. From an intercepted letter from the same source
a scheme for co-operating with the fleet when it should appear on the coast,
by marching troops from Florida in concert with a force composed of
Creeks and Cherokees, to the frontiers of North and South Carolina, was
made public. In the fall of 1776 Lord George Germain forwarded a supply
of presents to the Indians, and called the attention of the generals in
command to the necessity of securing their services. In November, 1777,
the Earl of Suffolk justified the alliance with the Indians on two grounds:
"one as necessary in fact, the other as allowable on principle; for, first,
the Americans endeavored to raise them on their side, and would gain them
if we did not; and next, it was allowable, and perfectly justifiable, to use
every means that God and nature had put in our hands."<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> This avowal
called forth from the Earl of Chatham a fierce denunciation of its author.</p>

<p>In the review which has been submitted of the acts and opinions, official
and personal, on both sides the ocean, concerning the employment of the
Indians in the Revolutionary War, the actors have been allowed to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
for themselves as nearly as possible. If we follow the order of events, we
can see that the flaming rhetoric of the address of the Continental Congress
to the people of Ireland, and the caustic arraignment of the king of
Great Britain in the Declaration of Independence, were calculated to produce
an erroneous impression as to the American position upon the subject.
With the publication, which afterwards took place, of the correspondence
of prominent men of the times, and of official documents from state
and national archives, this became evident. Sparks, in his <i>Washington</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>
says: "It has been usual in America to represent the English as much the
most censurable on this score in the Revolutionary War; and if we estimate
the amount of deserved censure by the effect produced, this opinion is no
doubt correct. But such is not the equitable mode of judging on the subject,
since the principle and intention are chiefly concerned, and not the
policy of the measure nor the success of the execution. Taken on this
ground, historical justice must award the Americans a due share of the
blame." We may complain of the brutal eagerness of Lord Dunmore to
sustain his official position at any expense to his people; we may hold up
for abhorrence the vindictive nature of the orders transmitted by General
Gage; we may point out the disingenuous evasions or downright falsehoods
of Colonel Guy Johnson; but we must accept responsibility for the
enlistment, before the battle of Lexington, of the Stockbridge Indians by
the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts Bay. We may claim with apparent
justice that the Continental Congress was reluctant to employ Indians;
yet we cannot undertake to reconcile the resolutions of that Congress on
May 25 and on June 17, 1776, with the indignation against Great Britain,
expressed so shortly afterward in the Declaration of Independence and the
Address to the people of Ireland, for doing what Congress, by resolutions
of previous date, had first declared to be highly expedient, and then had
specifically ordered to be done.</p>

<p>The examination which has heretofore been made of the position of the
colonies on the question of the employment of Indians as soldiers has
already brought to light some of the events requiring notice which took
place in the Northern Department. The few Mohegans, whose unfortunate
enlistment as minute-men furnished argument for Gage "that the colonies
were collecting all the Indians that they could", were practically the
only Indians the colonies found ready to take up arms in their behalf.
During the summer and autumn of 1775 Washington was much encouraged
by reports of the friendly disposition of the Eastern and Canadian Indians.
He was visited at Cambridge by delegations from the Penobscot, the St.
Francis, and the Caughnawaga tribes, who in friendly talks conveyed the
impression that they favored the colonies. The Six Nations were sorely
perplexed and divided in their councils.<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a> The residence of the superintendent
among them, his power as the distributer of gifts, the traditional
respect and affection that they had for his predecessor, and, above all, the
active agency of Joseph Brant, the Mohawk chief, whom the superintendent
adroitly engaged as his private secretary, all conspired to take them
over to the enemy.</p>

<p>It is surprising that any influences could have overcome,
even partially, this combination of circumstances in favor of the English;
but, as it proved, the personal attachment of the Oneidas and Tuscaroras
for Kirkland the missionary, and Dean the interpreter, was powerful
enough, when exerted in favor of neutrality, to prevent the greater part of
those tribes from following their brethren. Various conferences were held
during the summer between delegations of whites and representatives of
the Eastern tribes of the confederacy, in all of which those Indians who
participated professed their willingness to remain neutral.<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> In the autumn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
of 1775 the Indian commissioners of the Northern Department held a preliminary
conference at German Flats, and thereafter a formal conference at
Albany, at which the peace-speech of Congress was presented to the Six Nations,
or rather to that part of the confederacy which was represented at the
conference.<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> An agreement of neutrality was entered into, but its value was
greatly diminished by the fact that in the preliminary speeches the Indians
insisted upon the necessity of keeping open their communications. This
meant that they would regard the occupation of Fort Stanwix as an invasion
of their rights.<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> While these proceedings were going on, some of the
Indians who had accompanied Guy Johnson to Montreal returned to their
homes. When Dean, under orders from the commissioners, went out to
explain to the tribes the nature of the Albany treaty, he met these Indians
from Montreal. He says they were members of the Cayuga, Mohawk, and
Seneca tribes, and they informed their brethren that they had taken up the
hatchet at Montreal against the colonies. The Indians who had been at
Albany were displeased at this, and their influence so far prevailed that the
famous war-belt delivered by Guy Johnson was surrendered to General
Schuyler on the 12th of December at Albany.<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a></p>

<p>In the Mohawk Valley, the departure of Guy Johnson, in the summer of
1775, left Sir John Johnson the most prominent royalist, and at the same
time the most conspicuous friend of the Indians, in that region. He was
surrounded by several hundred Scotch Highlanders, who were devoted to
him personally, and followed his lead in politics. Early in January, 1776,
General Schuyler received orders to proceed to Johnstown, apprehend Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
John, and disarm his followers. In carrying out these orders the jealousy
of the Indians had to be considered. Conferences were held with them.
They tried to dissuade the general from invading the valley with an armed
force, but he carefully explained to them the situation, and insisted upon
advancing.</p>

<p>The Indians
were, however,
invited to be present
at the conference with
Sir John. As a result
of the expedition, the
Highlanders were disarmed
and Sir John
was arrested and paroled.
In May, it being
reported that Sir John
was not observing his
parole, a second expedition
was dispatched
to Johnson Hall.<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a>
Without waiting to be
arrested, Sir John fled
to Canada with a numerous
body of followers,
and shortly thereafter
entered the English
army. It was in
this same month that
the affair of the Cedars
took place. Here, for
the first time, Joseph
Brant&mdash;<i>Tha-yen-dan-e-gea</i>&mdash;appeared
in the
field against the colonies.
As a youth he
had been placed at the school for the instruction of Indians, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
conducted by the Rev. Eleazer Wheelock, afterwards president of Dartmouth
College. Brant is said to have been a man of good personal appearance
and of great physical courage. Enough of his life had been spent
among the whites to make him feel at ease in European costume, and to
fit him to enter society without fear of transgressing ordinary rules of etiquette.
As the private secretary of Guy Johnson, he had followed the
superintendent to Montreal. From that point he went to England, where
he was received with consideration. After a brief stay he returned to
Canada, arriving in time to participate, while his memory of British adulation
was still fresh,<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> in the joint attack of the British troops and Indians
on the Americans at the Cedars.<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a></p>

<p>The necessity for occupying Fort Stanwix became early apparent to the
Americans, and was the subject of frequent correspondence. This fort was
at the carrying-place between Lake Ontario and the Mohawk,<a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> and from
this post, on September 23, 1776, Colonel Dayton wrote that "Indian rumors
report Colonel Johnson at Oswego with a large force."<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> The alarm
was, however, premature.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1777<a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a> intelligence reached the Tryon County committee
of the march of Brant, with a large body of warriors, across the country
from Canada to the region where the Susquehanna River crosses the line
between New York and Pennsylvania. Considerable restlessness was also
noted at this time among the Tories. The presence of this large force of
Indians under Brant caused great uneasiness to the settlers, and in June
General Herkimer, with about three hundred of the militia, marched to
Unadilla. Then followed one of the most singular incidents, as the story is
generally told, of the whole border war. Herkimer's whole proceedings up
to this point were aggressive. He had ventured with an armed force into
Indian country. Upon his application, a co-operative force under Colonel
Van Schaick was dispatched to Cherry Valley. The presence of Brant
in the vicinity with a large body of followers was known, and Brant had
already avowed his loyalty to the king. Yet after a conference, to which
Brant came with evident reluctance, and at which he made a display of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
force with him in such a way as to make Herkimer's followers uneasy, the
meeting terminated without apparent result, unless Brant's renewed assertion
of loyalty may be so regarded.<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> Very soon after this a conference was
held at Oswego between the officers of the British Indian Department and
the Six Nations, at which the greater part of the latter were secured for
the service of the king, and the lines were finally drawn between them and
those members of the confederacy who were disposed either to maintain
neutrality or who actually favored the American side.</p>

<p>While these events were occurring, Burgoyne had started upon his march
by way of Lake Champlain, confident that he could without difficulty effect
a junction with the British force from New York. Lieutenant Hadden mentions
that Burgoyne said at an early date in the campaign that "a thousand
savages brought into the field cost more than twenty thousand men." What
confidence he had in his allies at the start diminished as he advanced. On
the 11th of July he wrote to the secretary of state "Confidentially to your
lordship, I may acknowledge that in several instances I have found the
Indians little more than a name",&mdash;a name which he sought by a proclamation
to make a terror; but in doing so he gave his adversaries ground for
holding him responsible for such enormities as the murder of Miss McCrea,<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a>
and for refusing to believe his indignant denials. His doubts of the value
of the Indians as soldiers were soon verified. They could scout and forage,
but at Bennington they were useless. They, in turn, finding that Burgoyne
endeavored to restrain them in their customary methods of warfare, and
that there was but little opportunity for plunder, began to drop away. At
the most critical period of the campaign they deserted in large numbers,
and could not be prevailed upon to return. Their presence, far from proving
a terror to the provincials, consolidated and thus strengthened them,
while on the other hand it undoubtedly led the English to overestimate
their own strength.<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a></p>

<p>By orders from London, dated March 26, 1777, the advance of Burgoyne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
was supported by a simultaneous movement by way of the St. Lawrence
and Lake Ontario. Lieutenant-Colonel Barry St. Leger, made a brigadier
for the purpose, led a force of
about 650 regulars, Hessians, Canadians,
and Tories, with upwards of
800 Indians, as stated by Colonel
Claus, who had charge of them.</p>

</div></div>

<p>This
command, bearing a few six-pounders,
three-pounders, and cohorns, marched
from Oswego, in the latter part of
July, for the valley of the Mohawk.
Unusual precautions were taken to
protect the flanks by Indians, and
the way was led by scouts. The
Oneidas gave the Americans ample
warning. Fort Stanwix was at the
time under the command of Colonel
Gansevoort, with Colonel Marinus
Willett as second,&mdash;both excellent
officers. The regular garrison consisted
of 550 men, who were poorly
supplied with provisions and munitions
of war. Indians infested the
woods during the summer, and several
atrocious murders were committed,
even near the fort. On August 2d,
a reinforcement of 200 men reached
the garrison, with two bateaux loaded
with stores. The supplies had been barely taken into the fort when St.
Leger's advanced guard appeared. The increased garrison had now six
weeks' provisions and an abundance of ammunition for small arms, but only
nine rounds a day for the cannon for the same period. During the summer
the garrison had partly repaired the fort, and had felled trees along the
banks of Wood Creek, so as to impede navigation.</p>

<p>News was conveyed to St. Leger of the approach of the reinforcement,
convoying supplies for the garrison. In the hopes of intercepting them he
authorized Lieutenant Bird to invest the place with the advanced guard,
at the same time adding to Bird's command a body of Indians under
Brant. Thinking perhaps that the garrison might offer to surrender upon
the approach of the investing force, he instructed Lieutenant Bird not to
accept a capitulation, but to await the approach of the main body of troops;
saying, "This is not to take any honor out of a young soldier's hands, but
by the presence of the troops to prevent the barbarity and carnage which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
will ever obtain where Indians make so superior a part of a detachment."
On the 3d of August, St. Leger arrived with the greater part of his
force, himself taking charge of operations which had been begun by
Lieutenant Bird on the 2d. Wood Creek had been "most effectually
choaked up", as St. Leger termed it, by the garrison of the fort; consequently
he could not at once bring forward his artillery and stores. He
forwarded to the garrison copies of a proclamation similar in tenor to that
issued by Burgoyne, and on the 4th completely invested the fort and
began the siege. Instead of the unfinished work which he says he had
been led to expect, he found it "a respectable fortress, strongly garrisoned
with 700 men, and demanding for its speedy subjection a train of artillery
of which he was not master."</p>

<p>The torpor of the inhabitants of Tryon County had excited indignation
at Kingston and at Albany. Under the pressure of an invading force, the
people responded to the call of General Herkimer, and that officer soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
found himself at the head of about 700 men.<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a> Among them were a small
number of Oneida Indians. On the 4th of August this assemblage of men
from the frontier moved forward from Fort Dayton at German Flats,
where they had gathered together, and on the 5th encamped near Oriskany.
From this point a message was sent to Colonel Gansevoort reporting
their approach, and asking him to announce his knowledge of the fact
by three rapid discharges of cannon. The messengers did not succeed in
entering the fort until the morning of the 6th between ten and eleven
o'clock. The three guns which were intended to communicate to Herkimer
the intelligence that the garrison knew of his approach, were then fired
at the fort. Herkimer's men were, however, too impatient to wait for
co-operation on the part of the garrison. At that hour they had already
advanced between two and three miles from their camp, and were engaged
with the enemy. In justice to Herkimer, it must be said that he endeavored
to prevent the advance, but it was evident from the temper of his
men that if he had not consented to move he would have lost their confidence.</p>

<p>At the time of Herkimer's approach, St. Leger was but poorly prepared
for an engagement. The garrison and the relief column together were
equal in number to St. Leger's total force. The passage of the creek had
been so completely blocked that 110 men were nine days in freeing it from
obstruction. To get his artillery and stores forward, St. Leger was obliged
to clear a path or roadway sixteen miles in length. He had but 250 soldiers
on duty at the camp when the news reached him that the Americans were
advancing. From these he could spare but 80 men to co-operate with 400
Indians in an ambuscade which was prepared for Herkimer. Sir John
Johnson commanded 50 of these, and was posted, for the purpose of checking
the column, on the road over which the Americans were advancing. It
was intended that the Indians and a small party of rangers under Colonel
Butler, who concealed themselves in the woods by the sides of the road,
should, when Sir John had performed his part of the work, pour in their fire
from all sides. At ten o'clock on the morning of the 6th, the approach of
the unsuspecting and undisciplined American troops, with their wagons,
was heard by the Tories and Indians in their place of concealment. The
presence of the enemy was first revealed to the Americans by a volley
from the impetuous Indians, who could not restrain themselves long enough
for the perfect development of the plan, but opened fire before the head
of the column had reached Sir John Johnson's post, and before the rear
guard, with the wagons, had completely entered the fatal circle. Had the
regiment which composed the rear guard been made up of men accustomed
to warfare, they might even then have done good service in behalf of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
surprised column. Unfortunately, those who could get away fled, leaving
their companions to their fate. The returns show that even this regiment
suffered severely in the engagement. A desultory combat followed, in
which each of the entrapped Americans fought for himself, taking advantage
of whatever opportunities offered for defence.
The remnant of the surprised and disordered
troops, thus brought to bay, proved formidable
opponents, and punished severely the Indians,
who bore the brunt of the fighting. Quite early
in the action several of the American officers
were killed or wounded. General Herkimer was
shot through the leg, and his horse was killed.
The saddle was removed from the animal and
placed at the foot of a tree. Upon this the disabled
general was seated by his men, and by his
coolness and indifference to suffering and to danger
won their respect. A heavy shower, which
interrupted the progress of the battle, afforded
opportunity for the Americans to arrange for
co-operation. After the shower was over, the contest was renewed, and,
according to the American accounts, fresh troops from the English camp
participated. Local annals are filled with tales of feats of valor and vindictiveness
which characterized this portion of the combat. At length
the Indians, wearied with the protracted contest, and disheartened by the
loss of several of their warriors, left the field. The English troops closely
followed them. A diversion made by the garrison probably hastened the
retreat. During this action the American loss was, according to their own
accounts, about two hundred killed and nearly as many wounded and prisoners.
The British loss was stated by themselves to have been not over
six killed and four wounded. From the same source we learn that the
Indians lost thirty-three killed and about as many wounded.</p>

<p>After the shower which checked the battle at Oriskany was over, Colonel
Willett, at the head of two hundred and fifty men, with a three-pound
carronade, sallied forth from the fort. The camp was almost entirely unprotected.
Lieutenant Bird, who was in charge of the portion which Willett
attacked, had received information that Sir John Johnson needed succor,
and had abandoned his post and marched towards Oriskany. Colonel Willett
penetrated the camp, secured a large quantity of guns, ammunition,
Indian weapons, blankets, etc., captured nearly all the books and papers of
the expedition, evaded an attempt on the part of St. Leger to cut off his
retreat, and safely effected his return to the fort with all his plunder,
without losing a man.<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a> The Indians, before going out to fight, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
stripped themselves nearly naked. On their return to camp they found
neither clothing, tents, nor blankets. Thus ended the day. The relief
party under Herkimer was shattered. The fort was still besieged, and the
besiegers had now opportunity to open their communications; but their
camp had been rifled, and their Indian allies, discouraged by their losses,
had no further interest in the siege, and began to think of home. St. Leger
sought to secure a capitulation on the ground of the defeat of Herkimer,
and caused the captured militia to write accounts setting forth the strength
of his force and the excellence of his artillery; but Gansevoort was firm.
The argument that the English would be unable to restrain the Indians
from barbarities if the siege were protracted was also spurned by the
garrison. Failing in this direct attempt upon their fears, an effort was
made to reach them through the people of the county. A proclamation
was put forth by Sir John Johnson, D. W. Claus, and John Butler as superintendents.
This also was of no effect. It being desirable to communicate
with Albany, Colonel Willett and Major Stockwell penetrated through the
enemy's camp by night, and proceeded on foot through the woods to Fort
Dayton. From that point Colonel Willett went to Albany. He found that
General Arnold had already been ordered to relieve the fort. The siege,
notwithstanding the fact that the artillery was of little avail, was continued
until the 23d of August. The garrison, ignorant of the fate of Colonel
Willett and Major Stockwell, were in grave doubts as to how long they
could hold out. On the 23d, the enemy suddenly abandoned their camp,
leaving a great quantity of material behind. The retreat was precipitated
by false intelligence which Arnold caused to be conveyed to the English
camp. St. Leger evidently suspected the ruse, but was unable to prevent
its effects.</p>

<p>The gallant Herkimer did not long survive the battle. A simple, unlettered
man, without experience in leading troops, he paid the penalty of
his mistakes at Oriskany with his life. His intrepidity during the action
and the coolness with which he faced death convinced his followers of his
dauntless courage, and his loss was deeply felt.</p>

<p>The Indians, in their resentment for the severe losses with which they
had met, murdered several of the American prisoners. They also burned
one of the Oneida settlements, destroyed the crops, and killed or drove
away the cattle belonging to the village. Colonel Butler, in his report to
Sir Guy Carleton concerning affairs at Fort Stanwix, coolly says, "Many
of the latter [prisoners] were, conformable to the Indian custom, afterwards
killed." On the retreat the Indians became uncontrollable, and robbed
the English officers. In the words of St. Leger, they "became more formidable
than the enemy we had to expect."</p>

<p>The failure of St. Leger and the capitulation of Burgoyne placed the
affairs of the colonies in such position that Congress deemed it worth while
to renew negotiations with the Indians. The time seemed opportune for
securing the services of the Six Nations, and the commissioners were, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
the 3d of December, 1777, instructed "to urge them to some decisive
enterprise which will effectually tie them to our cause." On the 4th the
commissioners were authorized to expend $15,000 as a reward to the Indians
for reducing Niagara. In February, 1778, they were instructed to
speak to the Indians "in language becoming the representatives of free,
sovereign, and independent States." "Whether it would be prudent to
insist upon the Indians taking an active part in behalf of these States"
would depend upon the temper in which they should appear to be. Action
upon that point was submitted to the discretion of the commissioners.
The temper of the Senecas was found to be far from favorable; and instead
of attending the conference, they sent a message expressing surprise that
while the tomahawk was still sticking in their heads, and they were still
grieving for the loss of their friends at Oriskany, the commissioners should
think of inviting them to a treaty. On March 4th, Washington was empowered
by Congress, if he should think it prudent and proper, to employ
in the service of the United States a body of Indians, not exceeding five
hundred. On the 7th, Colonel Nathaniel Gist was instructed to enlist
Indians on the borders of Virginia and North Carolina, not to exceed two
hundred in number. On June 11th, Congress recommended aggressive
warfare, being satisfied, from the presence of British agents among the
Indians, that the cruel war had been "industriously instigated" and was
still being "prosecuted with unrelenting perseverance by principal officers
in the service of the king of Great Britain."</p>

<p>In 1778, according to the plan of campaign as given by Guy Johnson
in his correspondence, the English forces on the western borders of New
York were divided into two bodies: one, consisting of Indians under Brant,
to operate in New York, while Deputy Superintendent Butler with the
other should penetrate the settled district on the Susquehanna. Brant,
who, according to Colonel Claus, "had shown himself to be the most faithful
and zealous subject his majesty could have in America", did his work
unsparingly, and ruin marked his track. In the valley of the upper Mohawk
and the Schoharie nothing but the garrison-houses escaped, and labor
was only possible in the field when muskets were within easy reach. Occasionally
blows were struck at the larger settlements. In the last of May,
Brant, with about three hundred and fifty Indians, destroyed a number of
houses in the Cobleskill Valley, and routed, with severe loss, a militia company
which attempted to pursue him.<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a> In June, the little town of Springfield,
at the head of Otsego Lake, was burned. Such of the men as did not
take flight were seized as prisoners. The women and children were not injured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
During the same month, Sir John Johnson, with a company of loyalists,
made a sudden descent upon the Mohawk Valley, the scene of their
former homes, and took a number of citizens prisoners.</p>

<p>In July, 1778, the threatened attack on Wyoming took place. This region
was at that time formally incorporated as the county of Westmoreland
of the colony of Connecticut. This result had been accomplished by
the persistence of the emigrants, under most discouraging circumstances
and at the expense of some bloodshed. In the fall of 1776, two companies,
on the Continental establishment, had been raised in the valley, in pursuance
of a resolution of Congress, and were shortly thereafter ordered to
join General Washington.<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a> Several stockaded forts had been built during
the summer at different points. The withdrawal of so large a proportion
of the able-bodied men as had been enlisted in the Continental service
threw upon the old men who were left behind the duty of guarding the
forts. Repeated alarms, during the summer of 1777, compelled the young
men to scour the woods, but their vigilance did not prevent some prisoners
being taken by the Indians. In March, 1778, another military company
was organized, by authority of Congress, to be employed for home defence.
In May, attacks were made upon the scouting parties by Indians, who were
the forerunners of an invading army. The exposed situation of the settlement,
the prosperity of the inhabitants, and the loyalty with which they
had responded to the call for troops, demanded consideration from Connecticut,
to whose quota the companies had been credited, and from Congress,
in whose armies they had been incorporated; but no help came.
On June 30th, an armed labor party of eight men, which went out from
the upper fort, was attacked by Major Butler, who with a force estimated
by the American commander in his report at eight hundred men, Tories
and Indians in equal numbers, had arrived in the valley. This estimate
was not far from correct; but if we may judge from other raiding forces
during the war, the proportion of whites is too large, for only a few local
Tories had joined Butler. The little forts at the upper end of the valley
offered no resistance to the invaders.</p>

<p>On July 3d, there were collected at "Forty Fort", on the banks of the
river, about three miles above Wilkesbarré, two hundred and thirty Americans,
organized in six companies (one of them being the company authorized
by Congress for home defence), and commanded by Colonel Zebulon
Butler, a resident in the valley and an officer in the Continental army. It
was determined, after deliberation, to give battle. In the afternoon of that
day, this body of volunteers, their number being swelled to nearly three
hundred by the addition of old men and boys, marched up the valley. The
invaders had set fire to the forts of which they were in possession. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span>
perplexed the Americans, as was intended, and they pressed on towards the
spot selected by the English officer for giving battle. This was reached
about four in the afternoon, and the attack was at once made by the Americans,
who fired rapidly in platoons. The British line wavered, but a flanking
fire from a body of Indians concealed in the woods settled the fate of
the day against the Americans. They were thrown into confusion. No
efforts of their officers could rally them while exposed to a fire which in a
short time brought down every captain in the band. The Indians now cut
off the retreat of the panic-stricken men, and pressed them towards the
river. All who could saved their lives by flight. Of the three hundred
who went out that morning from Forty Fort, the names are recorded of
one hundred and sixty-two officers and men killed in the action or in the
massacre which followed. Major Butler, the British officer in command,
reported the taking of "two hundred and twenty-seven scalps" "and only
five prisoners." Such was the exasperation of the Indians, according to
him, that it was with difficulty he saved these few. He gives the English
loss at two whites killed and eight Indians wounded.<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a></p>

<p>During the night the worst passions of the Indians seem to have been
aroused in revenge for Oriskany. Incredible tales are told of the inhumanity
of the Tories. These measures of vengeance fell exclusively upon
those who participated in the battle, for all women and children were
spared.</p>

<p>As soon as the extent of the disaster was made known, the inhabitants
of the lower part of the valley deserted their homes, and fled in the direction
of the nearest settlements. Few stayed behind who had strength and
opportunity to escape. In their flight many of the fugitives neglected to
provide themselves with provisions, and much suffering and some loss of
life ensued. The fugitives from the field of battle took refuge in the forts
lower down the valley. The next day, Colonel Zebulon Butler, with the
remnants of the company for home defence, consisting of only fourteen men,
escaped from the valley. Colonel Denison, in charge of Forty Fort, negotiated
with Major Butler the terms of capitulation which were ultimately
signed. In these it was agreed that the inhabitants should occupy their
farms peaceably, and their lives should be preserved "intire and unhurt."
With the exception that Butler executed a British deserter whom he found
among the prisoners, no lives were taken at that time. Shortly thereafter,
the Indians began to plunder, and the English commander, to his chagrin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
found himself unable to check them. Miner even goes so far as to say
that he promised to pay for the property thus lost. Finding his commands
disregarded, Butler mustered his forces and withdrew, without visiting the
lower part of the valley. The greater part of the Indians went with him,
but enough remained to continue the devastation, while a few murders committed
by straggling parties of Indians ended the tragedy. The whole
valley was left a scene of desolation. In August the American forces
returned, and a few settlers came back and endeavored to save some of their
crops, but occasional surprises by Indians warned them that the region was
still unsafe. In September, Colonel Hartley marched with one hundred
and thirty men against the Indian towns of Tioga and Sheshequin, and
broke up those settlements.</p>

<p class="p2">Brant, meanwhile, had not been idle. On July 18th he burned a little
settlement about six miles from German Flats, called Andrustown. In
the latter part of August, German Flats, a settlement containing thirty-four
houses, was destroyed and the cattle were driven away. Only two
lives were lost, the inhabitants having taken refuge in Fort Dayton. The
rapine was not, however, all on one side. From Schoharie an American
expedition under Colonel William Butler threaded its way through the
woods, forded the flooded streams, and destroyed the Indian town of
Oquaga, and on their return burned the Tory settlement and the grist and
saw mills at Unadilla.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1778, General Lafayette ordered a fort to be built at
Cherry Valley, and this post was afterwards garrisoned by the Continental
regiment under Colonel Ichabod Alden. During the fall, information of a
positive character was conveyed to Colonel Alden that the place was
threatened. Some of the officers of the garrison were accustomed to sleep
outside the fort, and notwithstanding the warning, this practice was continued.
Neither Alden nor his men were familiar with Indian warfare.
The citizens wished to move their effects into the fort, but Colonel Alden
quieted them by saying that he had good scouts out, who would give timely
warning. One of these scouting parties, through carelessness, was captured
on the night of November 10th, and by this means the enemy learned the
exact condition of affairs. The invading force is said to have consisted of
two hundred whites and about five hundred Indians, the whole under command
of Captain Walter N. Butler. This officer had been arrested as a spy
near Fort Stanwix during the siege, and had been condemned to death, but
had been reprieved, and had escaped from custody. He had with him a
body of Senecas, besides Brant and his Mohawks. The night after the
capture of the scouting party, the enemy encamped near the village. On
the morning of the 11th, under cover of a heavy rain, they penetrated a
swamp in the rear of the house used as headquarters, where they concealed
themselves, awaiting a favorable opportunity for attack. Chance favored
the garrison, and gave them a brief warning. A resident of the valley, on
the way to the village, at about half past eleven o'clock discovered two
Indians, and was fired upon by them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span></p>

<p>Although wounded, he was able
to reach headquarters in advance of the enemy, and give the alarm. The
regimental officers hastened towards the fort, and some of them succeeded
in reaching it before the Indians surrounded it. Colonel Alden was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
of the first victims of his own infatuation, having been shot while trying
to reach the fort. For three hours and a half the enemy protracted their
efforts to capture the post. Sixteen Continental soldiers were killed during
the attack on the village, and thirty-two of the inhabitants, principally
women and children, were massacred. Some of the murders were committed
under circumstances of peculiar barbarism, in which whites competed
with Indians. The houses, barns, and out-houses of the settlement
were burned. The garrison, although too weak to attack the enemy, was
strong enough to defend the fort. The enemy having completed the work
of destruction as far as they could, retired, but made a feeble renewal of
the attack on the 12th. This was easily repelled, and they then devoted
themselves to collecting the cattle belonging to the villagers. The greater
part of the prisoners who had been captured were liberated on the 12th,
and permitted to return to the settlement. In setting them free, Captain
Butler entered into a correspondence with General Schuyler, in which he
endeavored to relieve himself from responsibility for the massacre. Brant
also denied responsibility for it. Butler in his letter asserted that at
Wyoming "not a man, woman, or child was hurt after capitulation, or a
woman or child before it." If we admit the disclaimers of the Butlers,
father and son, the fact still remains that they headed raiding parties,
where plunder and destruction of property were the main purposes of the
expeditions, and where the massacre of the inhabitants was one of the
possibilities of success. Strip from the stories of Wyoming the exaggerations
of the frightened refugees, the brutal massacre of the prisoners
remains. The mercy which was extended to the prisoners at Cherry
Valley merely reduces the number of horrors which were committed there.
The massacre still stands out conspicuously as the most shocking in its
details of any event in this region during the Revolution. Fortunately for
the memory of Sir John Johnson, notwithstanding his prominence as the
scourge of the Mohawk Valley during the war, his name is not associated
with either of these events.</p>

<p class="p2">On March 6, 1779, Washington, acting under instructions from Congress,
"to take effectual measures for the protection of the inhabitants
and the chastisement of the Indians", tendered to General Gates the
command of an expedition "to carry war into the heart of the country of
the Six Nations, to cut off their settlements, destroy their next year's
crops, and do every other mischief which time and circumstances will
permit." This offer Gates declined, and on March 31st General Sullivan
was appointed to the command. He was to lay waste all the Indian settlements
in the most effectual manner, "that the country may not be merely
overrun, but destroyed." Sullivan was to assemble his forces in Pennsylvania.
General James Clinton was to assemble a force in the Mohawk
Valley. In all the preliminary discussions of the campaign it was contemplated
to make the main advance by way of the Mohawk. This idea was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
however, abandoned, and it was arranged that Clinton should cross over to
the Susquehanna River, and by that route effect a junction with Sullivan.
As a preliminary to the campaign, Colonel Van Schaick, on the 18th of April,
left Fort Stanwix at the head of five hundred and fifty-eight men, including
officers, and made a sudden descent upon the Onondaga towns. The expedition
was completely successful, and on the 24th Van Schaick was back
at the fort, and able to report that this work of destruction and plunder
had been accomplished, with the loss of only one man. On June 16th,
General Clinton arrived at Canajoharie, where he found about fifteen hundred
troops. From that point over two hundred boats and three months'
provisions for the command were transported over the hills to Lake Otsego.
On June 30th, Clinton reported to Sullivan that this transfer had been
accomplished, and that he was now ready to come down the river. Here
he remained with his troops until August 9th, awaiting orders. Meantime
he constructed a dam across the outlet of the lake, by means of which he
raised the water about a foot.</p>

<p>By the latter part of June the troops which were under Sullivan's immediate
command had assembled in the Wyoming Valley. They numbered,
on the 21st of July, 2,312 rank and file. They remained in this valley,
awaiting the arrival of stores, until the last day of July, when marching
orders were issued. During this period of idleness the troops at Wyoming
and at Lake Otsego chafed at their inaction. The enemy continued the
policy of desultory attacks and devastating raids, some of which were committed
in close proximity to the American encampments. In May, at
Fantinekill and at Woodstock, in Ulster County, New York, houses were
destroyed, cattle killed, and prisoners taken. On the night of July 19th,
Brant, with a force one third white and two thirds Indians, variously estimated
at from ninety to one hundred and sixty men, made a descent upon
the Minisink settlement. The citizens and militia of Goshen marched
next day in pursuit, and were joined on the 21st by a small detachment
of the Warwick militia, the whole number being, according to Colonel
Hathorn, who took command, one hundred and twenty. On the 22d they
overtook Brant, were completely outwitted by him, and were defeated,
with a loss of forty-four killed.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania several outrages were committed in the immediate vicinity
of Sullivan's army. On July 28th Freeland's fort, on the West Branch
of the Susquehanna, was taken by the enemy, and a small detachment sent
from Northumberland for its relief was badly cut up. Neither Clinton nor
Sullivan were diverted from the purposes of the campaign by these forays.
The Oneidas had agreed to join Clinton, but were prevented by a threatening
message from General Haldimand. They excused themselves to the
American general on the ground that they feared an attack on their castles,
should they assist in the campaign. Their defection had no influence upon
operations. On the 13th Sullivan destroyed the Indian town of Chemung,
and then fortified a post at a narrow point on the peninsula, a short distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
above the junction of the Tioga and Susquehanna. Clinton, on
receipt of orders to advance, destroyed the dam at the foot of the lake on
the 9th, and successfully embarked his bateaux on the flood of his own creating.
On the 22d the junction of the two columns was effected. On the
26th the united forces moved forward, and on the 29th encountered the
enemy under the Butlers, McDonnell, and Brant at Newtown, five miles
from Elmira. Here the enemy had selected a spot on rising ground which
commanded the road, and had thrown up a rude breastwork of logs. Some
attempt had been made to conceal it by placing before it brush and young
trees. Here they were apparently prepared to make a stand. General
Poor was dispatched with his brigade to gain a hill to the right, and from
thence to attack the enemy's left flank. After allowing some time for Poor
to reach his destination, Sullivan opened with his artillery. Poor met with
resistance, but when he had forced his way to a position which became
threatening to the enemy, they abandoned their whole line.<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> On the 30th
Sullivan proposed to his men, as provisions were short, that they should
go on half rations, trusting to the country to furnish them the rest. This
was readily agreed to. The baggage and heavy guns were sent back, and
on the 31st the column advanced, taking for campaign artillery four light
three-pounders and a small howitzer. The main army marched down the
east side of Seneca Lake to its outlet, destroying villages, cornfields, and
orchards on the way. From the foot of the lake a party was sent down
the Seneca River towards Lake Cayuga to destroy a town, and another was
sent a short distance up Lake Seneca, on the west side, for the same purpose.
From the foot of this lake the main army moved westward, skirting
the northern ends of lakes Canandaigua, Honeyoye, and Hemlock, destroying
as it moved. Then it bore to the southwest, and passed the southern
end of Lake Conesus. On the 14th of September, about sunset, the expedition
arrived at the great castle of the Senecas, on the west side of the
Genessee River, and on the opposite side of the valley from the site of
Geneseo. On the evening of the 12th, as the army approached this region,
Sullivan ordered a scouting party to be sent out. It was his intention that
only five or six men should go, but the officer in charge of the party, Lieutenant
Thomas Boyd, took with him twenty-six men, including the Indian
guides. In the darkness, Boyd unconsciously passed the encampment of
Butler and his force, who were ambushed near Lake Conesus, waiting for
Sullivan. On the morning of the 13th, Boyd, having reconnoitred an Indian
town, sent word to camp by two of his men, and halted where he intended
to await the approach of the army. While waiting here, some Indians were
discovered by the party, whom Boyd indiscreetly pursued. By this means
his force was led directly into the power of Butler, whose men completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span>
surrounded the Americans and opened fire upon them. Nerved to desperation,
a gallant attempt was made by the devoted band to break through the
enemy's lines. In this attempt eight of them succeeded. Fifteen of the
party were killed. Two, Boyd and his sergeant, were captured. The two
captives were taken to Seneca Castle, or "little Beard's town", and honored
for their brave defence with tortures of unusual cruelty. The "western
door of the Long House", as this place was termed by the Indians, consisted
of one hundred and twenty-eight houses, some of which were well
built. The gardens were filled with corn and vegetables. All these were
destroyed; and on the 15th the army, having completed its work, began its
return march. Sullivan had, on the outward march, dispatched a messenger
from Catharine's town to the Oneidas, calling upon them to furnish
him with some warriors. At Kanadasaga, near the foot of Lake Seneca,
on his return, he received a message from them, explaining why their warriors
had failed him, and putting in a plea for mercy in behalf of the Cayugas.
He accepted their excuses, but paid no attention to their requests.
From Kanadasaga he sent Colonel Smith, with a command, to complete the
destruction on the west side of Lake Seneca. He also detached Colonel
Gansevoort, with one hundred and five men, with instructions to proceed
to Albany, and on the way to destroy the lower Mohawk Castle. Through
motives of policy, the latter part of this order was not carried out to the
letter. A detachment was also sent out to destroy the towns on the eastern
side of Lake Cayuga. On the 21st another detachment was dispatched,
with orders to lay waste the towns on the western side of Lake Cayuga,
and to intercept the Cayugas if they should attempt to escape the officer
who had gone up on the other side of the lake. The rest of the army then
marched south, between Seneca and Cayuga lakes. When they reached
the valley of the Tioga, an expedition was sent up that river on an errand
of destruction. On the 28th these several detachments, with the exception
of Gansevoort's, had all rejoined the main column, having accomplished
their work without resistance. They were then met by a supply
of provisions from Tioga. The work of destroying Indian towns and crops
was finished. Fort Sullivan, near the junction of the rivers, was abandoned
and razed. The army descended the Susquehanna to Wyoming, which
place they reached October 7th. By the route which they took, the distance
marched by the army, in going from Wyoming to Seneca Castle, was
two hundred and fifteen miles, all of it in Indian country, without a road
over which a wagon could be transported. Forty Indian towns were destroyed.
Some of them were insignificant. Several had from twenty to
thirty houses. One had one hundred and twenty-eight houses. Colonel
Gansevoort, speaking of the lower Mohawk Castle, said: "It is remarked
that these Indians live much better than most of the Mohawk families.
Their houses were well furnished with all necessary household utensils, and
a great plenty of grain." The excellent construction of some of the houses
of the Seneca and Cayuga villages was a source of surprise to the invaders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
They marvelled at the well-conditioned orchards, the cultivated gardens,
and the extensive cornfields. They left behind them, on the sites of these
villages, smoking ruins and blighted vegetation. Notwithstanding the fact
that the expedition was delayed so long waiting for stores, it was undertaken
with the certainty that there was not enough on hand for the purpose,
if the army was to rely upon what was supplied. General Sullivan
was compelled to march thus or not at all. In numbers the troops fell
short of what had been counted on. They met with no opposition worthy
of note. The losses during the campaign, by accident, by sickness, and in
the field, amounted to only forty. They could not have foreseen that General
Haldimand would be so completely bewildered as to their intentions,
and that he would refuse to believe that they could purpose invading this
region, until too late to render the Indians assistance.<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a> The greater part
of the warriors of the Six Nations were in the field on the side of the English.
It was but reasonable to anticipate that the Indians would receive aid
from their allies in defence of the Indian country. Everything militated
against the probability of the expedition being able to accomplish its work
with such ease. The expedition was too large to treat the question of
supplies in the same way that an ordinary raiding party would have done.
Through the delays in procuring supplies, it was prosecuted at a time when
the army could subsist partially upon the growing crops. Had Sullivan
started when he expected, he must have depended upon his train. Otherwise
the Indians could easily have destroyed their stores and impeded the
progress of the army.<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a></p>

<p>As a part of the original scheme, a simultaneous movement from Fort
Pitt against the Indian towns on the Alleghany was ordered. The difficulty
of communication between the two forces led to the abandonment of all
idea of co-operation. Colonel Brodhead, who had charge of the movement
on the Alleghany, was left to pursue his own course. On August 11th he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
left Pittsburgh at the head of six hundred and five rank and file, with one
month's provisions. With this force he proceeded up the river by boat to
Mahoning; there the stores were loaded on pack-horses, and the march
was begun. On the way to the Indian towns the advance guard came in
contact with a party of between thirty and forty warriors, whom they put
to flight. The detachment marched for a distance of about two hundred
miles from Pittsburgh, and destroyed the Indian settlements along the Alleghany
extending for eight miles, and consisting of one hundred and thirty
houses. The growing crops and provisions were ruined. This extraordinary
march was made without the loss of a single man, and without meeting
any warriors except the party already mentioned.</p>

<p>On October 20, 1779, Washington wrote to the Marquis de Lafayette, saying:
"General Sullivan has completed the entire destruction of the country
of the Six Nations, driven all the inhabitants, men, women, and children,
out of it, and is at Easton on his return." He further said that Colonel
Brodhead had inflicted similar chastisement on the "Mingo and Muncey
tribes", living on the Alleghany, French Creek, and other waters of the
Ohio. Washington concluded with these words: "These unexpected and
severe strokes have disconcerted, humbled, and distressed the Indians exceedingly,
and will, I am persuaded, be productive of great good; as they
are undeniable proofs to them that Great Britain cannot protect them, and
that it is in our power to chastise them whenever their hostile conduct
deserves it."<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> The cruel steps taken against the Senecas, Cayugas, and
Onondagas were probably justifiable as war measures. War against these
Indians without the adoption of their own tactics could only be prosecuted
at a great disadvantage.<a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a> The destruction of their homes and the consequent
removal of the natives to a point more distant from the American
settlements, together with the necessity thus thrown upon the British government
of providing for their allies, undoubtedly affected the aggressive
power of the Indians and diminished the value of their alliance. But if it
was expected that raids upon the border settlements would be stopped by
this campaign, then the authorities must have been disappointed. The border
knew no peace until the war was ended.</p>

<p>The Indians, driven out of their own country and left without shelter and
without food, took refuge at Niagara for the winter. The Oneidas feared
an attack, and abandoned their castles. About four hundred of them placed
themselves under the protection of the government at Schenectady. In
April, 1780, the settlement at Harpersfield was destroyed, and a scouting
party of Americans which happened to be in the neighborhood was captured.
Repeated blows were struck at the scattered, poorly defended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
settlements along the border. The lower Mohawk was invaded by a force
under Sir John Johnson, and the local histories, in their records of the
work of the summer of 1780, have a melancholy monotony of conflagration
and plunder. In August the settlement at Canajoharie was laid waste by
Brant, and several small settlements adjacent to Canajoharie, and at Norman's
Kill, not far from Albany, were ravaged. From the valley of the
Mohawk the enemy moved southward, destroying a number of houses and
capturing prisoners in Schoharie Valley. In October, 1780, Schoharie Valley
was again ravaged, this time from the south, by an invading force of about
one thousand in all, under Sir John Johnson, which consisted of Tories,
together with Brant and his Mohawks, and Cornplanter with a body of Senecas.
They had, by way of artillery, two small mortars and a brass three-pounder.<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a>
There were three forts in the valley, in which the inhabitants
took refuge. The invaders did not succeed in capturing either of the forts,
and the loss of life in them was small, but they left scarcely a building
standing in the whole valley.</p>

<p>After thoroughly completing the work of destruction in Schoharie Valley,
the invaders proceeded to the valley of the Mohawk, and ravaged the
country on the north side of the Mohawk from Caughnawaga to Stone
Arabia and Palatine. A little force from Stone Arabia, acting, it is supposed,
under a promise of support from General Van Rensselaer, undertook
to check them. The general had collected some of the militia, and was
to fall upon the rear of the enemy. The promised support was not furnished.
Colonel Brown, who led the attacking party, was killed, and his
followers were badly cut to pieces. After this encounter Sir John's forces
renewed their work of destroying property in the neighborhood of Stone
Arabia, and then moved slowly up the river, ravaging the country as they
went. The invaders were followed by the Americans, whose numbers increased
as they moved, until they were numerically stronger than the enemy.
There were some Oneidas with the Americans, under command of one of
their own number holding a commission from the Continental Congress as
lieutenant-colonel. On the afternoon of October 20th, just at nightfall, a
skirmish took place between the two commands at the spot selected by Sir
John for his evening bivouac. It was soon terminated by the increasing
darkness, of which the Americans took advantage to withdraw to a camping
place about three miles back, and the invaders, availing themselves of
the opportunity, hurriedly sought the woods. During their flight the enemy
captured a party of Americans which had been dispatched to destroy their
boats.<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> After this raid the upper Mohawk Valley and the Schoharie Valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
rivalled in their desolation the region of the lakes which had been invaded
by Sullivan the preceding year. Numbers of prisoners had been carried
off during these raids, some of whom were liberated shortly after capture.
Others were detained till the close of the war. In one instance a child was
returned by Brant, with a letter, in which he said "I do not make war
upon women and children. I am sorry to say that I have those with me
in the service who are more savage than the savages themselves."</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the operations in the Mohawk Valley, the enemy
ascended Lake Champlain and captured Forts Ann and George. Portions
of Kingsbury, Queensbury, and Fort Edward were burned. A branch of
this expedition destroyed the settlement at Ballston. At the same time, a
party of about two hundred, chiefly Indians, under Major Haughton of the
53d, left Canada, and destroyed several houses in the upper part of the Connecticut
Valley, and carried off thirty-two inhabitants as prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a></p>

<p>The work of retribution on the part of the Indians did not stop with what
has been recorded. Even during the succeeding winter Brant was on the
war-path, appearing now here and now there in the Mohawk country cutting
off stragglers and detached parties. Great difficulty was experienced
in furnishing the garrisons at the outposts with provisions. Distress ensued,
and there was serious danger that the outlying defences could not be
maintained. Fort Stanwix was badly damaged in May, 1781, both by flood
and by fire, and in consequence the post was shortly afterward abandoned.
The command of the Mohawk Valley was this season assigned to Colonel
Willett. He carefully acquainted himself with its condition, and infused
a portion of his own active spirit into the management of affairs. Very
shortly after he assumed command, on June 30th, Currietown, a village
near the mouth of the Schoharie, was destroyed. With a small force, Willett
pursued the raiders, overtook them, and routed them with severe loss.
In July, Colonel Willett wrote that the number of men in Tryon County
liable to bear arms did not exceed eight hundred. At the beginning of the
war the enrolled militia numbered 2,500 men. He accounted for this
reduction by supposing that one third had been killed or made prisoners,
one third had gone over to the enemy, and one third had abandoned the
country. Indeed, life in the valley had become almost unendurable. The
only places of safety were within the walls of the stockaded forts which
were scattered through the region. All through the summer of 1781 detachments
of the enemy struck blows at different points along the border.
The most conspicuous of these desultory acts of devastation was the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
of the little town of Wawarsing. Unsuccessful efforts were made
this season to seize the persons of both General Gansevoort and General
Schuyler. The active movements of the year closed with a foray on the
Mohawk by Sir John Johnson and Major Walter N. Butler, in the latter part
of October. When the Americans learned the approach of the invaders,
Colonel Willett gathered a force together, with which, although inferior in
numbers to the enemy, he attacked them at Johnstown. The varying fortunes
of the day were, on the whole, with the Americans. The enemy fled,
after dark, to the woods. Willett followed them for some days, and had a
collision with their rear guard, in which the notorious Major Walter N.
Butler was shot through the head and left on the field.<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> The difficulties of
the military as well as the political situation had been greatly complicated
this summer by the menacing aspect of the British forces on Lake Champlain,
and doubts as to the fidelity of certain of the leaders in Vermont,
whose hostility to the threatened extension of the authority of New York
over the inchoate State had been pronounced in terms of bitter earnest.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1782, although the frontiers of New York were
not altogether quiet, the scene of activity in border warfare was transferred
further west. There were none of the organized raids of the enemy in the
valleys of the Mohawk and Schoharie, with which the inhabitants had become
so familiar.</p>

<p>In February, 1783, the last movement of the war on the border took
place in this region. It was an attempt by Colonel Willett to surprise the
garrison at Oswego. A forced march of a night and a day was made
through the trackless forests, on the snow, from the Mohawk Valley to the
vicinity of the fort. Then preparations for the assault were made, but
when the column advanced the guide became confused and lost his way.
As surprise was essential for success, the attempt was abandoned. Willett
and his men found their way back as best they could, enduring on the
return march intense suffering from fatigue, cold, and exposure. Colonel
Willett then proceeded to Albany, at which place he arrived in time to hear
peace proclaimed.</p>

<p>The story of this chapter opened with the determination of a boundary
line between the king of Great Britain and his allies. It closes with an
assurance on the part of the Continental Congress, which is intended to
pacify the Indians, that, "as the country is large enough to contain and
support us all, and as we are disposed to be kind to them, to supply their
wants, and to partake of their trade, we, from these considerations and
from motives of compassion, draw a veil over what is passed, and will
establish a boundary line between them and us, beyond which we will
restrain our citizens from hunting and settling, and within which the Indians
shall not come, but for the purpose of trading, treating, or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
business equally unexceptionable."<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> The discussion of how far the kindly
spirit which pervades these promises has been maintained in subsequent
dealings with the Indians does not fall within the subject of this chapter.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid"><a name="c647" id="c647"></a>CRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE relations of the Indians to the British government and to the colonies during
the period immediately preceding the Revolutionary War, is readily studied in <i>The life
and times of Sir William Johnson, Bart.</i>, by William L. Stone (Albany, 1865, in 2 vols.<a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a>),
which was intended to form a part of a history of the relations of the Iroquois to current
events. Stone completed but two volumes of the series, the <i>Life of Brant</i> and the <i>Life of
Red Jacket</i>. The <i>Life of Sir William Johnson</i>, being incomplete at the time of his death,
was finished and published by his son, of the same name.<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a> The book for awhile stood
alone in its detailed treatment of the official relations and dealings of the superintendent
with the Indians. Later publications have infringed somewhat upon its monopoly.</p>

<p>The <i>Pennsylvania Archives</i>, and the <i>Minutes of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania</i>,
commonly cited as "Colonial Records", lay bare the secrets of the province, and
furnish authentic information upon many points which prior to their publication were
obscure.<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a></p>

<p>The documentary publications of the State of New York are for the purposes of this
chapter of even more value than those of Pennsylvania. They contain many official
papers from the hands of Sir William Johnson, and letters from Guy Johnson, Daniel
Claus, and Generals Carleton and Haldimand, treating of Indian affairs. Some of these
documents help us materially in the study of the situation. The history of the publications
known as the <i>N. Y. Colonial Documents</i> and <i>Documentary History of N. Y.</i> is told
elsewhere;<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> but the <i>Journals of the Provincial Congress</i> are of peculiar use in the present
inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> Such of the conferences, treaties, and agreements with Indians on the part
of the colonies, the Continental Congress, and the government of the United States as
have been printed, are scattered through a variety of publications.<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span></p>

<p>The literature of border life, from which the habits and methods of life of the frontier
inhabitants may be drawn, is too extensive to permit any attempt at an exhaustive recapitulation
of titles. Especial use has been made in this chapter of Dr. Joseph Doddridge's
<i>Notes on the Settlements and Indian Wars</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a> perhaps the most valuable of the many
works upon this subject. Notwithstanding the sufferings from Indian raids which Dr.
Doddridge himself endured, he deals fairly with the subject of border warfare, and candidly
admits the terrible responsibility of the whites for counter outrages. He draws
a vivid picture of the lack of law on the frontier, aggravated as it was by the conflicts of
colonies. "In the section of the country where my father lived", he says, "there was for
many years after the settlement of the country neither law nor gospel. Our want of legal
government was owing to the uncertainty whether we belonged to Virginia or Pennsylvania."
"Thus it happened that during a long period we knew nothing of courts, lawyers,
magistrates, sheriffs, or constables." "Every one was, therefore, at liberty to do whatever
was right in his own eyes."</p>

<p>In <i>An Account of the remarkable occurrences in the life and travels of Col. James Smith,
etc., etc.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a> the author unconsciously gives us a picture of the lawlessness of frontier life
and the power of the volunteers. The story is told in a simple manner, and the narrative
is full of interest. The rare <i>Chronicles of Border Warfare</i>, by Alexander S. Withers
(Clarksburg, Va., 1831), is a recognized authority, and is frequently quoted. It was reproduced
in substantial form in Pritt's <i>Border Life of Olden Times</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a> a compilation of reprints
of volumes, narratives and statements relating to border life. The relations of the
Indians to current events are also to be traced in Gale's <i>Upper Mississippi</i>, etc.,<a name="FNanchor_1328_1328" id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> and in
Ketchum's <i>History of Buffalo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1329_1329" id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> The latter work covers much of the ground which Col.
Stone had preëmpted. The materials are well arranged, the views of the author are clearly
presented, and as a result the volumes form a valuable contribution to the history of the
Indians.<a name="FNanchor_1330_1330" id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a> Many details will be found collected in Drake's <i>Book of the Indians</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1331_1331" id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a></p>

<p>James Handasyd Perkins was a careful student of the early history of the country, and
contributed many articles to the periodical literature of his day on the subject of Indian
history and border warfare, which have been collected.<a name="FNanchor_1332_1332" id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a> The compiler of <i>Annals of the
West</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1333_1333" id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a> in the preface to the third edition of that work, says: "The first edition was issued
at Cincinnati, where he (the compiler) was assisted by the lamented James H. Perkins, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
gentleman highly competent for the task." In the second edition of the <i>Annals</i> "the
editor had the valuable assistance of Rev. J. M. Peck, a gentleman whose long residence
in the far West, and familiarity with the history of those portions of the work less elaborately
treated of in the first edition, rendered him admirably qualified for the undertaking."
This work, in its chronological arrangement of events, touches upon a portion of the
ground covered by this chapter. In 1791, J. Long published in London a volume entitled
<i>Voyages and Travels of an Indian Interpreter</i>, etc. Long arrived at Montreal in 1768.
His occupation for the next seven years made him familiar with frontier life and Indian
ways. He volunteered in 1775 with the Indians who entered the English service, and
was at Isle au Noix with a few Mohawks on the occasion of their collision with the Americans.
He also served a short time with the regulars. He states intelligently the value
of the alliance of the Six Nations to the English.</p>

<p>Wills de Haas, in his <i>Indian Wars of Western Virginia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a> has devoted one chapter to
"Land Companies",<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a> and another to the "Employment of Indians as Allies." His treatment
of these topics is brief, but the chapters contain much more information on the
subjects than can generally be obtained from American histories.</p>

<p>In <i>Fugitive Essays</i>, etc., by Charles Whittlesey (Hudson, Ohio, 1852), an article is
reproduced from the January number (1845) of the <i>Western Literary Journal and Review</i>,
entitled "Indian history: their relations to us at the time of the American Revolution",
which is well worth examination.</p>

<p>The <i>Calendar of the Virginia State Papers and other Manuscripts</i>, 1652-1781 (Richmond,
1875),<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> though meagre as a whole, is particularly full on the subject of the encroachments
of individuals and companies on Indian lands. Among these papers is the
deposition of Patrick Henry, setting forth that he felt compelled to withdraw from all connection
with land schemes, when, as a member of Congress, he found himself in a position
where he might be called upon to act as a judge in matters in which he was directly interested.
It may be inferred from what he says that there were among his associates some
who were not so scrupulous.</p>

<p>Many of the questions involved in the adjustment of boundaries and settlement of treaties
between the Indians and the British government survived the Revolution, and reappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
before the United States Congress in the struggles of land companies for possession
of their alleged purchases.<a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a> Through the memorials to Congress presented by the
Illinois and Ouabache Land Company, which are to be found scattered through the
Senate and House documents, as well as in separate tracts, we learn that in order to
sustain the claim of this company it became important to show that the Six Nations did
not own the Wabash region. For that purpose Deputy-Superintendent Croghan made
affidavit that "the Six Nations claim by right of conquest all the lands on the southeast
side of the river Ohio down to the Cherokee River, and on the west side of the river
down to the Big Miami River."<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a> The king had agreed with the Indians that his people
should not go west of an established boundary line. He had warned settlers off their
lands. The colonists who were in arms against the king were after the lands, by fair
means or foul. What was considered fair means in those days, and what causes there
were for the exasperation of the Indians, cannot be fully appreciated unless the subject
be followed even beyond the days of the Revolution.</p>

<p><i>The Register of Pennsylvania</i><a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a> also contains a variety of material relating to the subject.
A number of the early documents will be found in Hubley's <i>American Revolution</i>
(1805).</p>

<p>In making an estimate of the Indian population within the borders of the United
States at this time, I have been obliged to rely largely upon my own deductions. Bancroft
(<i>United States</i>, iii. ch. 22), giving an estimate of the number of Indians east of the Mississippi
and south of the St. Lawrence and the chain of lakes in 1640, says: "We shall
approach, perhaps exceed, a just estimate of their numbers if we allow ... one hundred
and eighty thousand souls" (edition of 1841). It will be observed that the foregoing
estimate includes the Canadian Indians. In the preparation of the estimate which I have
given, I have examined many scattered statements of the number of warriors of the different
tribes, which comprehend different areas within their respective limits, and which
frequently overlap each other. The arbitrary spelling of Indian names often presents the
same name in such different dress as to make its identification difficult. If we bear in mind
that the name as it appears in print is a phonetic rendering of a word which from the
mouths of different individuals would sound differently to the same ear, and further, that
those who have given us the various renderings were men of different nationalities and of
different degrees of cultivation, we shall oftentimes be able to recognize the same tribe in
separate statements, under names the spellings of which at first sight have no seeming
identity. As regards this Indian population, a tabulated statement will he found in Jefferson's
<i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i>, which relies upon Croghan, Bouquet, and Hutchins,
supplemented by Dodge and Gallatin. Croghan's estimate will be found in Proud's <i>History<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
of Pennsylvania</i> (vol. ii. p. 296.)<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a> Bouquet's estimate will be found in the <i>Historical
Account</i> of his expedition,<a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a> headed "Names of different Indian Nations in North America,
with the numbers of their fighting men." Hutchins's estimate will be found in <i>An
historical narrative and Topographical description of Louisiana</i>, by Thomas Hutchins
(Philadelphia, 1784, App. iii. p. 65), headed "A list of the different nations and tribes of
Indians in the Northern District of North America, with the number of fighting men."
Sir William Johnson's estimate of the Present State of the Northern Indians,<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a> made Nov.
18, 1763, will be found in the <i>Doc. Hist. of New York</i>, i. p. 26, and in <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>,
vii. p. 582.</p>

<p>The estimate of Sir James Wright is in the <i>Georgia Hist. Soc. Coll.</i> (Savannah, 1873),
iii. part 2, p. 169. The synopsis of the Indian tribes, by Albert Gallatin, is printed in the
<i>Amer. Antiquarian Soc. Proc.</i>, ii. Still another list was published in <i>Sketches of the
History, manners, and customs of the North American Indians, with a plan for their
melioration</i>, by James Buchanan, Esq., his Britannic majesty's consul for the State of
New York (New York, 1824, 2 vols.), i. ch. xii. pp. 138-39, where it is called "Names of
the different Indian nations hitherto discovered in North America, the situation of their
countries, with the number of their fighting men" (1770-1780).</p>

<p>Buchanan claimed to have received this list from Heckewelder, the missionary, and it is
identical, except for certain palpable errors in transcribing, with a list in what is now
known as Trumbull's <i>Indian Wars</i>, the authorship of which is attributed in the original
edition<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> to the Rev. James Steward, D. D. Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull, in reply to a
question from me, says the book was "written by Henry Trumbull, then of Norwich,
when about seventeen years old."<a name="FNanchor_1344_1344" id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span></p>

<p>Gilbert Imlay, in <i>A Topographical Description of the Western Territory of North
America</i>, etc. (London, 1792, p. 234), gives a list of Indians on both sides of the Mississippi,
and from the Gulf to the St. Lawrence. This list was made up from "Croghan,
Boquet, Carver, Hutchins and Dodge." The figures that he uses are plainly intended for
the number of the fighting-men, but he puts the total population in this district at less than
60,000. In a second and a third edition, the list is modified. He gives twenty-eight tribes
east of the Mississippi, and his calculation of population is based upon 700 to a nation or
tribe. He finds in all 20,000 souls, and "consequently between 4,000 and 5,000 warriors."</p>

<p>I have had occasion in this investigation to examine somewhat the question of the
population west of the Mississippi, for two purposes: 1st, to determine the numbers to
be eliminated from some of the general statements which include tribes whose residence
was in the Far West; and 2d, to test the question of the proportion of warriors to population.
Brackenridge's <i>Views of Louisiana</i><a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> has proved of especial service for these
purposes. There are also some statistics in Perrin du Lac's <i>Voyage dans les deux Louisianes</i>,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_1346_1346" id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society</i> contain many estimates of the
population of the natives in different parts of the country, made at different times. Among
these an estimate (1795, p. 99) of the Creeks, Choctaws, Chicasaws, Cherokees, and Catawbas,
furnished by Dr. Ramsay, places their total population in 1780 at 42,033,&mdash;fighting
men 13,526. An estimate of the Indian nations employed by the British in the Revolutionary
War, made by Captain Dalton, superintendent of Indian affairs for the United
States (<i>Ibid.</i> x. p. 123), was published in 1783, and gives the number of men furnished
by the tribes as 12,680, of whom the Six Nations proper contributed 1,580. The Choctaws,
Chicasaws, Cherokees, and Creeks furnished 2,200. The value of this list lies only
in the opportunity which it affords for testing the probable accuracy of some of the
others.<a name="FNanchor_1347_1347" id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a></p>

<p>There is in the <i>Doc. Hist. of New York</i> (i. p. 17) "an enumeration of the Indian tribes
connected with the government of Canada in 1736." It is difficult, if not impossible, to
identify many of the tribes in this estimate.<a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a></p>

<p>Elias Boudinot, in <i>A Star in the West; or an humble attempt to discover the long
lost tribes of Israel, preparatory to their return to their beloved city, Jerusalem</i> (1816),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
devotes a small portion of his discussion to the question of population (p. 131 <i>et
seq.</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a></p>

<p>"A Table of the principal Indian Tribes" was printed in the <i>American Pioneer</i>, a
monthly periodical (Cincinnati, i. pp. 257, 408, and ii. 188), where it was credited to
Drake's <i>Indian Biography</i>; but in fact it was taken from the <i>Book of the Indians</i> by the
same author, which is prefaced with an alphabetical enumeration of the Indian tribes
and nations. The numbers of the different tribes are given, and the date of the estimates
from which the numbers were derived. Franklin furnished a partial list of warriors in
1762, which may prove useful for comparison, and is included by Benjamin Vaughan in
the <i>Political, Miscellaneous, and Philosophical Pieces, &amp;c., written by Benjamin Franklin,
&amp;c., &amp;c. Now first collected</i> (London, 1779).<a name="FNanchor_1350_1350" id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a></p>

<p>Colonel Force, in the <i>American Archives</i>, gives a vast amount of material on the employment
of Indians as soldiers by the Americans, which before had been lost from sight
in scattered publications. The indexes to these volumes do not suitably analyze their
contents. The chief corresponding British repositories are Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1351_1351" id="FNanchor_1351_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> a
mine which was worked by all the earlier writers upon the Revolutionary War, and to-day
the original authority for much of our information; and the <i>Parliamentary Register</i>, often
called the <i>Parliamentary Debates</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1352_1352" id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a>&mdash;more specific accounts of which, as well as of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
<i>Annual Register</i>, the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, and the <i>Scots Magazine</i>, will be found in
another place. All of these help to show us the information upon which the British
public formed their opinions.</p>

<p>The attitude of Congress upon the Indian question has been traced by means of the
<i>Journals</i> and <i>Secret Journals</i> of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_1353_1353" id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a></p>

<p>The fact that the powers conferred upon Carleton for the suppression of rebellion in
the provinces probably influenced opinion somewhat in the colonies has been already
adverted to, as well as the further fact, shown by extracts from other commissions, etc.,
that there was no special meaning to be attached to the language used in the commissions.
That it did have weight and was used as an argument in the discussion is shown in a
review of <i>The plan of the Colonies, or the charges brought against them by Lord M&mdash;&mdash;d
and others, in a letter to his Lordship</i>, printed in <i>The Monthly Review or Literary Journal</i>
(liv., for 1776, p. 408). "Let him review Gen. Carleton's last commission", says the
writer. "Your Lordship has already seen it once too often. For what purpose was he
authorized to <i>arm</i> the Canadians, and then to <i>march</i> into any other of the <i>plantations</i>,
and his majesty's rebellious subjects there to attack, and, by <i>God's help, them to defeat
and put to death</i>? For what purpose did Guy Johnson deliver black belts to all the
Indian tribes in his district, and persuade them to lift up the hatchet against the white
people in the colonies? The Congress is possessed of those very war-belts; they have
a copy of Governor Carleton's commission; they have long since possessed the whole
plan."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the chief American compilation, aiming to be a reflex of current news,&mdash;Moore's
<i>Diary of the American Revolution</i>,&mdash;is singularly deficient in excerpts respecting
the opinions on employing Indians.<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> There is need of but brief references to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
consideration of the subject among the later writers,&mdash;such as Ryerson in his <i>Loyalists
of America</i> (ii. ch. 33); Mahon (ch. 52) and Lecky (iv. 14), in their respective histories
of England. There is special treatment of the matter by William W. Campbell in
"The direct agency of the English Government in the employment of the Indians in the
Revolutionary War", published in the <i>New York Hist. Society Proc.</i> (1845, p. 159).<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a></p>

<p>Frederic Kidder, in <i>The Expeditions of Capt. John Lovewell</i> (Boston, 1865, p. 114),
says: "The last trace of them [the Pequakets] as a tribe is in a petition to the government
of Massachusetts, dated at Fryeburg, in which they ask for guns, blankets,
and ammunition for thirteen men who are willing to enroll themselves on the patriot
side. This document was indorsed by the proper authorities, and the request was
granted."<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a></p>

<p>On the 10th of July, 1775, Adjutant-General Gates, at Cambridge, in a circular letter of
instructions for the use of recruiting officers, says: "You are not to enlist any deserter
from the ministerial army, nor any stroller, negro, or vagabond, or person suspected of
being an enemy to the liberty of America, nor any under 18 years of age." "You are not
to enlist any person who is not an American born, unless such person has a wife and
family, and is a resident in this country" (Niles's <i>Principles and Acts</i>, etc.). Though no
mention is made of Indians, the fact of their not being excepted is often pointed out as
of significance.</p>

<p>Letters in the <i>N. H. Provincial Papers</i><a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> betray the fears, along the border, of Carleton
and Johnson, and reveal the friendly disposition of the Canadian Indians.</p>

<p>The references for the Kennebec march of Arnold are given in another chapter; but in
<i>Senter's Journal</i>, there mentioned, we have the details of Arnold's interview with the
Indians at Sartigan, and of the inducements which he offered them for enlisting. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
fact that Indians joined the American army at this point is corroborated by Judge Henry,
in his <i>Account</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1358_1358" id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> while the topic is also treated in E. M. Stone's <i>Invasion of Canada</i>
(Providence, 1867).</p>

<p>Many of the more important acts and resolves of the several colonies, apposite to this
inquiry, are in the <i>American Archives</i>. The importance which circumstances gave to
the position taken by the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts Bay causes great interest
to attach to the proceedings of that body. Many conferences between committees
and different Indians were held, the accounts of which are found in <i>A Journal of the
Honourable House of Representatives of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay in New
England. Begun at the Meeting House in Watertown in the County of Middlesex on
Wednesday the Nineteenth day of July, Anno Domini, 1775</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1359_1359" id="FNanchor_1359_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a> These will also be found
in a reprint of the Journals for 1774-1775, entitled <i>Journals of each Provincial Congress
of Massachusetts in 1774-1775</i>, etc., Boston, 1838.</p>

<p>General Gage, in his letter to Stuart, complained of two things: the employment of
Indians by the rebels and the shooting of his sentries. It has been shown that the acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
of the Massachusetts Bay Provincial Congress justified his first assertion. As to the
second, see Frothingham's <i>Siege of Boston</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1360_1360" id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a></p>

<p><i>The Military operations in Eastern Maine and Nova Scotia, during the revolution,
chiefly compiled from the journals and letters of Col. John Allan</i>, by Frederic Kidder
(Albany, 1867), completes the story of the attempt to secure the services of the Eastern
Indians, and gives the reasons alleged by the Indians for not complying with the treaty
entered into at Cambridge, to furnish a regiment.<a name="FNanchor_1361_1361" id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a></p>

<p>The events which took place in the Mohawk Valley during the summer and fall of 1775
were of far-reaching importance. Their history is recorded in the correspondence of such
men as Washington and Schuyler, in the meetings of local committees, and in conferences
with Indians. Accounts of many of them are to be found in the <i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i> and in
the <i>American Archives</i>. There is besides a mass of material in the possession of scattered
families, much of which has been worked over by local historians.<a name="FNanchor_1362_1362" id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a> The most important
of all these later works is the <i>Life of Joseph Brant (Tha-yen-dan-e-gea), including
the Border Wars of the American Revolution</i>, etc., by William L. Stone.<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a></p>

<p>The prodigious labor performed by Colonel Stone in the classification and orderly
arrangement of the immense amount of his material will be gratefully appreciated by the
investigator to-day, even though he has at command publications by the state and national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
governments containing much of the same material. Since Colonel Stone's day other
laborers have been diligently at work in the same field, gleaning facts and collecting historical
material of various kinds. Their work has revealed some errors in the <i>Life of
Brant</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1364_1364" id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a> which are not of such importance, however, as to displace the work from its position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
as the chief authority on the subject. The habits and modes of life of the Indians and
the organization of the confederacy of the Six Nations were not understood as thoroughly
when Colonel Stone wrote as they are to-day. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that
Morgan, in his <i>League of the Iroquois</i>, does not agree with Stone in the assertion that
Brant was the principal war-chief of the confederacy. A portion of Stone's ground had
been earlier covered by William W. Campbell in his <i>Annals of Tryon County, or the Border
Warfare of New York during the Revolution</i> (N. Y., 1831),<a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> a work still looked upon
as authority upon many points, republished (1849) as <i>The Border Warfare of New York
during the Revolution, or the Annals of Tryon County</i>. Another volume devoted to the
same topics, but widely different in character and in execution, is Jephtha R. Simms's
<i>History of Schoharie County and Border Wars of New York</i> (1845), republished in 1882,
with additional matter, as <i>The Frontiersmen of New York, showing customs of the Indians,
vicissitudes of the pioneer white settlers, and Border Strife in two wars, with a
great variety of romantic and thrilling stories never before published</i>,&mdash;both editions
showing an industrious care to amass, with little skill in presentation.</p>

<p>The Revolutionary War divided the councils of the Six Nations. Had they acted as
a unit in favor of the English, the problem would have been more difficult for the provincials.
The friendly warnings of the Oneidas were of constant use to the Americans
throughout the struggle. Their position materially changed the problem which was set
for St. Leger, and though they did not then act aggressively, their unfriendly attitude
must have caused his retreating column uneasiness. These Indians were probably of
greater service as neutrals&mdash;who in that character were able to penetrate the enemy's
country and report what was going on&mdash;than they would have been had they taken
up the hatchet on the American side at the outset. Their attitude was largely due to the
Rev. Samuel Kirkland, the missionary.<a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a></p>

<p>In the account of the border wars, as in all other respects, Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i> is a
useful publication, based upon ordinarily accepted authorities, with local anecdotes, traditions,
and descriptions interjected by the author.<a name="FNanchor_1367_1367" id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a> A contemporary narrative (<i>Mass.
Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, ii.), called an "Historical Journal", was necessarily written without opportunity
for critical revision.</p>

<p>We have a narrative of events from the English side in Stedman's <i>American War</i>,
where it is said that Montgomery was "joined by several parties of Indians" (i. p. 133),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
and that Ethan Allen's party numbered "about one hundred and fifty men, composed of
Americans and Indians." One inducement for Burgoyne's employment of Indians was
"a well-grounded supposition that if he refused their offers they would instantly join the
Americans." Wyoming, we learn, "fell a sacrifice to an invasion of the Indians" (ii.
p. 73). He speaks of "the Indian settlements of Unadilla and Anaguago, which were
also inhabited by white people attached to the loyal cause."</p>

<p>Thacher's <i>Military Journal</i>, a contemporaneous account of current events on the
American side, as they appeared or as they were told to the author, is often of help in
fixing the date of some event about which there is a dispute, even when the description
itself of the action is meagre, or consists of mere mention. Thus he puts the
destruction of Cobleskill in 1778, when Campbell says it was in 1779,&mdash;an error on the
part of the later writer, unless there was more than one raid upon that insignificant settlement,

<p>In the study of the topography, so far as it was known, and of the geographical nomenclature
of the frontier just previous to the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the <i>Memoir

<p>The story of St. Leger's expedition and the battle of Oriskany, though told at some
length in this chapter as illustrative of border warfare, is so essential a part of the campaign
of Burgoyne that the critical discussion of the authorities has been, except in some
matters pertaining to the use of Indians, treated rather in connection with the story of
that campaign than here.<a name="FNanchor_1370_1370" id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a></p>

<p>The historical introduction upon Sir John Johnson which Gen. J. Watts De Peyster
contributed to <i>The Orderly-Book of Sir John Johnson</i> (Albany, 1882) indicates a marked
change of opinion upon the exploits of Johnson, as compared with the views which he
had expressed in earlier accounts of the battle of Oriskany published by him in 1859,
1869 (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, Jan.), 1878 (<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Jan.), and 1880. He confesses that
an examination of the British accounts has given him a somewhat enthusiastic admiration
for Johnson's methods, but his repeated study has not yet cleared up all errors.<a name="FNanchor_1371_1371" id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
This <i>Orderly-Book</i> gives us the movements of Sir John Johnson's command up to the
time that they left Oswego. Through the details for guard and fatigue duty during the
delay at Buck Island we get at the different commands which formed the expedition. De
Peyster and Stone conclude, from the introduction of a general order for the issue of forty
days' rations for five hundred men, just before leaving Buck Island, that this determines
the number of St. Leger's command, but the evidence is hardly conclusive.<a name="FNanchor_1372_1372" id="FNanchor_1372_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a></p>

long among them as captive and adopted member; and it is on her authority (p. 114) that
it is sometimes stated that the English offered bounties for scalps.<a name="FNanchor_1373_1373" id="FNanchor_1373_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a> An account of the

<p>As respects the Minisink massacre, the accounts made public by Brant were fairly
accurate, though they ran some risk in being transmitted first to Niagara, thence to
Quebec, and finally to England. They stand the test of time better than the American
accounts. The Tory organ in New York, <i>Rivington's Gazette</i>, printed the first American
accounts, representing that only thirty escaped from the ambuscade,&mdash;a statement followed
in several histories; but the local authorities, on the strength of investigations
made at the time of erecting the monument, generally agree on the smaller statements of
loss.<a name="FNanchor_1374_1374" id="FNanchor_1374_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a></p>

<p>The earliest account of the massacre at Wyoming is in a letter written at Poughkeepsie,

largely the source whence Gordon, Botta,<a name="FNanchor_1376_1376" id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> and Marshall<a name="FNanchor_1377_1377" id="FNanchor_1377_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a> drew their accounts. Owing
probably to the fact that Marshall cites Ramsay in his footnotes, this last historian is

massacre will be found in Girardin's continuation of Burk's <i>History of Virginia</i> (iv. of the

<p>Isaac A. Chapman, the first of the local historians to touch the subject, prepared a
manuscript, with a preface dated Wyoming, July 11, 1818; but the book was not published
until after his death, as <i>A Sketch of the history of Wyoming</i><a name="FNanchor_1381_1381" id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> (Wilkesbarre, 1830).</p>

<p>Charles Miner, the first to sift out the errors from the accepted accounts, after collecting
from survivors their personal experiences, published a series of newspaper sketches
which led to his <i>History of Wyoming, in a series of letters from Charles Miner to his son,
William Penn Miner, Esq.</i>, etc. (Philadelphia, 1845). He carefully chronicled the antecedent
history of the Connecticut colony, and gave the first trustworthy detailed account of
the invasion, and the articles of capitulation granted to the several forts by Major John
Butler. Mr. Miner's agent was apparently refused, at the foreign office, London, a copy of
the report of Major Butler. This important document will be found in <i>Wyoming, its
history, stirring incidents and romantic adventures</i>, by George Peck, D. D. (New York,
1858).<a name="FNanchor_1382_1382" id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a> The author says in his preface: "Forty years since we first visited Wyoming, and
from that period we have enjoyed rare advantages for the study of its history." He gives
the report of Zebulon Butler to the board of war,<a name="FNanchor_1383_1383" id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> dated at Gnadenhütten, July 10, 1778
(p. 49), the report of Major John Butler to Lieut.-Col. Bolton, dated at Lackuwanak, 8th
July, 1778 (p. 52); and there is a thorough résumé of the discussion as to Brant's presence
at Wyoming (pp. 87, 88, 89). The report of Butler to Bolton was presumably the
document which he received through the favor of Hon. George Bancroft, who cites it
(<i>United States</i>, x. 138) in his account of the Wyoming invasion.<a name="FNanchor_1384_1384" id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a></p>

<p>The massacre at Cherry Valley has not, like Wyoming, an especial literature of its own.
The event is described in the <i>Remembrancer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a> and in all the histories, and is fully treated
in Campbell's <i>Annals of Tryon County</i> (ch. 5), in Simms's <i>Frontiersmen of New York</i>, and
in Stone's <i>Life of Brant</i> (i. ch. 17). Both Campbell and Simms lived in this region, and
it was the special field in which Brant was operating. This particular expedition was not
under Brant's control. He had apparently concluded the season's work and joined Walter
N. Butler's force reluctantly, being jealous of him for having command of the expedition.
At Wyoming the soldiers were massacred, but the citizens were spared. At Cherry Valley
most of the soldiers escaped, but in the first heat of the attack the citizens were indiscriminately
slaughtered. It would have been better for Brant's reputation if he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
present at Wyoming rather than at Cherry Valley,&mdash;although so far as his influence is
concerned it was evidently exerted to prevent excesses.<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a></p>

<p>Among the Sparks MSS. (no. xlvii.) in the Harvard College library, there are some
extracts from the diary of Benjamin Warren, who was in the fort at Cherry Valley at the
time of the attack. He says the attack on the fort was renewed early on the morning of
the 12th, but was easily repelled.</p>

<p>The <i>Boston Gazette and Country Journal</i> of Dec. 7, 1778,<a name="FNanchor_1389_1389" id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a> contains an account from an
officer who was in the fort November 11th, when it was attacked. He says it rained
hard that morning. The enemy "passed by two houses, and lodged themselves in a
swamp a small distance back of Mr. Wells's house, headquarters; half past eleven <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>
Mr. Hamlin came by and discovered two Indians, who fired upon him and shot him through
the arm. He rode to Mr. Wells's, and acquainted the colonel, the lieutenant-colonel, major,
and adjutant. The two last (the house at this time being surrounded by Indians) got to
the fort through their fire; the colonel was shot near the fort." The fort was subjected
to a brisk fire for three hours and a half. On the 12th the enemy collected the cattle,
and at sunset left. McKendry's account of the attack on Fort Alden agrees in substance
with that of Benjamin Warren.<a name="FNanchor_1390_1390" id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a></p>

<p>The expedition of General Sullivan (1779) against the Indian towns in New York has
proved a fertile field for discussion. Its policy has been assailed; its management condemned;
its results belittled. There is no want of records of occurrences in the campaign,<a name="FNanchor_1391_1391" id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a>
but their interpretation has not been settled, and probably never will be. The
account of Gordon is especially bitter against Sullivan, and he cuts down the number of
villages from forty, as given by Sullivan, to eighteen.<a name="FNanchor_1392_1392" id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a></p>

<p>Thomas C. Amory, in his <i>Military Services of General Sullivan</i>, aims at a vindication
of Sullivan by the use of material which was not known to his detractors, and he has
diligently pursued this purpose elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1393_1393" id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> The character of the charges against Sullivan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
has been partially indicated in the quotations already given. He has been attacked
because he demanded so many troops for the expedition. Whether it would have been
wise to venture with a smaller force so far into Indian country, which was within easy
supporting distance of the outposts of the enemy, is a matter of opinion, concerning which
no new facts have been recently brought to light. We know that Sullivan expected help
from the Oneidas which he did not receive, and that he anticipated that the Indians
would receive aid from Niagara, in which he was agreeably disappointed. I have already
stated that in my judgment he had a right to expect formidable opposition, and the only
explanation of his not meeting with greater resistance is to be found in the perplexity in
Haldimand's mind occasioned by the boats which Clinton had collected in the Mohawk
Valley. On this mental confusion Sullivan could not have counted.<a name="FNanchor_1394_1394" id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a> The number of
men demanded by Sullivan in the preliminary discussions about the campaign was much
larger than the number actually furnished him. It was perhaps not out of place for him
to secure, if he could, a force large enough to place his campaign beyond failure, but,
taking into consideration the general condition of army matters, the number demanded
was entirely disproportionate to the work to be performed. He wanted 2,500 men to
march up the Susquehanna, and 4,000 men to invade the towns by way of the Mohawk
(F. Moore, <i>Corresp. of Laurens</i>, N. Y., 1861, p. 136). In fact, he had 2,500 men in his own
command, and Clinton's force brought the numbers up to 4,000.<a name="FNanchor_1395_1395" id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a> He has been accused
of making demands for supplies which were unreasonable, both as to quality and as to
quantity, and it is evident from Washington's correspondence that he feared Sullivan was
not willing to march light enough for such a campaign. While Sullivan was not familiar
with Indian campaigns, and perhaps demanded more supplies at the outset than Brodhead,
or Clarke, or Williamson would have asked for, the numbers of his command must
not be forgotten. Nor must the fact be overlooked that the provisions which were delivered
to him proved to have been put up in bad packages, and had spoiled.<a name="FNanchor_1396_1396" id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span></p>

<p>Sullivan has also been found fault with for not protecting from Indian raids the neighborhood
in which his army was stationed while waiting for supplies. His action in this
respect was deliberate. He was of opinion that the blows struck along the border during
this interval of time were intended to divert him from the purposes of the campaign,
and that any attempts to check these desultory attacks, by sending out expeditions here
and there, would simply be playing into the enemy's hands.<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a> The charge of extravagant
living during the march seems absurd. At a time when the army was on half rations
and the men were using ingenious devices to take advantage of the growing crops, he
could hardly have had much opportunity for riotous living. When the expedition started
the corn was green and suitable to roast. As they advanced it became too mature for
this, and the soldiers were compelled in other ways to prepare it for food.<a name="FNanchor_1398_1398" id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a></p>

<p>Curious differences of opinion prevailed in the several accounts as to the numbers
of the enemy who opposed the army at Newtown. Some of the accounts place them as
low as 700, while others put them as high as 1,500.<a name="FNanchor_1399_1399" id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a></p>

<p>Sullivan has been ridiculed for the language used in describing the Indian settlements;
but his descriptions, though misleading, are the natural expressions of a man who found
in these settlements evidences of a higher civilization than he had expected. A comparison
of the entries in the various diaries and journals will show that many were surprised
at the excellence of the Indian houses, while others saw only the discomforts of
life under such surroundings.<a name="FNanchor_1400_1400" id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> General Sullivan has been assailed because he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
attack Niagara. There had been some discussion about a second campaign against
Canada and an attempt on Niagara, but Washington's correspondence shows that it had
been abandoned in connection with the campaign against the Indian towns, unless it
could be accomplished through the Indians themselves. The instructions to Sullivan
show this,<a name="FNanchor_1401_1401" id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a> and a letter from Sullivan, given in the <i>Laurens Correspondence</i> (p. 141), shows
that Sullivan did not conceive it to be a part of the campaign, even if he had deemed an
attack on Niagara possible.</p>

<p>In his report to the Committee of Congress, January 15, 1776, Washington discusses
the possibilities for the forthcoming campaign.<a name="FNanchor_1402_1402" id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> For the reduction of Niagara he estimates
that an army of twenty to twenty-one thousand men would be required; thirteen
thousand to remain in the East, and seven or eight thousand to operate against Niagara.
The expenses incident to such a campaign, and the great number of men required, practically
put it out of the question, and his conclusion was as follows: "It is much to be
regretted that our prospect of any capital offensive operations is so slender that we seem
in a manner to be driven to the necessity of adopting the third plan,&mdash;that is, to remain
entirely on the defensive; except such lesser operations against the Indians as are absolutely
necessary to divert their ravages from us." January 18 he wrote to General
Schuyler: "It has therefore been determined to lay the Niagara expedition entirely aside
for the present, and to content ourselves with some operations on a smaller scale against
the savages and those people who have infested our frontier the preceding campaign."<a name="FNanchor_1403_1403" id="FNanchor_1403_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a></p>

diligence of Craft in his search for the sources of authority for the campaign is shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
in his "List of Journals, Narratives, etc., of the Western Expedition, 1779"<a name="FNanchor_1406_1406" id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a> (<i>Mag. of

of the Second New York Continental Regiment, from May 1 to October 3,
1779, with an introduction, copious historical notes, and maps of the battlefield of Newtown
and the Groveland ambuscade. General Clark also makes use of "parts of other

before the reader a complete account of the whole work of the expedition, in the words
of those who participated in it, together with a list of journals, etc., similar to that of
Craft, but sufficiently different in details to show independent work.</p>

<p>The remains of Lieutenant Boyd and those who fell with him, in their desperate attempt
to cut their way through the enemy by whom they were surrounded, were in 1842 removed
from their place of burial, and deposited with appropriate ceremonies at Mount Hope. A
collection of the various proceedings on this occasion was edited by Henry O'Reilly, as
<i>Notices of Sullivan's Campaign, or the Revolutionary Warfare in Western New York;
embodied in the addresses and documents connected with the funeral honors rendered to
those who fell with the gallant Boyd in the Genessee Valley, including the remarks of Gov.
Seward at Mount Hope</i> (Rochester, 1842).</p>

<p>Brodhead's campaign against the Indian settlements on the Alleghany, in Western
New York and Pennsylvania, was carried out while Sullivan was on his march. Like Van
Schaick's raid on the Onondaga towns, although independently executed, it formed part
of the scheme of the season's work. In Gay's <i>Popular History of the United States</i>
(vol. iv.) there is a good general account of Sullivan's campaign, but in a note (p. 7) it is
said that "Brodhead's expedition has usually been considered of little moment, and it
has been denied, or doubted, by some writers, that it ever took place. Its incidents are
for the first time collated and fully told by Obed Edson, in the <i>Magazine of [Amer.]
History</i>, for November, 1879." As a matter of fact, however, there has never been occasion
for investigators to doubt that this campaign had taken place, or to underestimate its
value. The report of Brodhead was given to the public at the time,<a name="FNanchor_1409_1409" id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a> and was published
in full in the <i>Remembrancer</i> (ix. p. 152). Washington, in his letter to Lafayette, which
has already been quoted, mentioned the work done by Brodhead with evident appreciation
of its extent and value.<a name="FNanchor_1410_1410" id="FNanchor_1410_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a></p>

Canada under Sir John Johnson and others against the frontiers of New York, which were
supposed to have connection with Arnold's treason, prepared from the originals, with an
introduction and notes." Reference has already been made to the fact that Hough differed
from Stone as to the cause for the removal of the Oneidas from their castles in the winter
of 1779-1780, and their establishment near Schenectady. Hough says (p. 32): "Some of
the Oneidas evinced a willingness to join the enemy. To prevent such a misfortune, four
hundred of their people were removed to the neighborhood of Schenectady, and there
supported at public cost." In a note he adds: "We find nothing among the Clinton
Papers to justify the statement of Colonel Stone<a name="FNanchor_1412_1412" id="FNanchor_1412_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> (<i>Brant</i>, i. 55) relative to the destruction
of the Oneida settlements by the enemy during the winter of 1779-80, and are led
to believe that the removal of these people to a place of safety in the interior was a
measure of policy rather than of actual necessity from the presence of the enemy."
There is among the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> actual evidence that Hough's conclusion was correct.
In a letter from General Haldimand, dated at Quebec, Nov. 2, 1779, he says: "He [Sir
John Johnson] halted at Oswego, with an intention to cut off the Oneida nation, who have
uniformly and obstinately supported and fought for the rebels, notwithstanding the united
remonstrances and threats of the Five Nations, joined to every effort in our power to
reclaim them. In this he has likewise been disappointed, the Indians of Canada refusing
their assistance", etc.<a name="FNanchor_1413_1413" id="FNanchor_1413_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> A letter of Guy Johnson to Lord Germain makes the same statements.</p>

<p class="pc1"><b>A.</b> OPINIONS OF PROMINENT AMERICANS ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF INDIANS
IN WAR.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> is not easy to determine the position of prominent individuals on this question prior to the date when
Congress had come to a conclusion. The passage of the Quebec Bill in 1774, and the ample powers which
were conferred upon Carleton to suppress revolt, had occasioned alarm. Perhaps the circumstances justified
suspicion, but there was no special cause for it. The language used in Carleton's commission was copied from
the commission of James Murray. If there had been no change of governors, the powers conferred upon the
governor could never have been supposed to have been specially directed against the rebellious colonies.<a name="FNanchor_1414_1414" id="FNanchor_1414_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a>
After the outbreak of hostilities, we meet, in the published correspondence of the day, with occasional expressions
of opinion on the question of employing Indians. It must not be forgotten that when these letters were
written rumors were current that the English in Canada were endeavoring to secure the services of Indians,
and to the extent that the writers believed these statements their opinions were doubtless influenced by them.
On May 14th, Joseph Warren wrote to Samuel Adams, saying: "It has been suggested to me that an application
from your Congress to the Six Nations, accompanied with some presents, might have a very good
effect. It appears to me to be worthy of your attention, etc." (Frothingham's <i>Warren</i>). On August 4th,
Washington communicated to the President of Congress the opinion of a Caughnawaga chief, that if an expedition
against Canada was meditated the Indians in that quarter would give all their assistance. On Sept.
21st, he reported to the honorable Congress that, "encouraged by the repeated declarations of Canadians and
Indians, and urged by their requests", he had dispatched the Arnold expedition (Sparks's <i>Washington</i> and
his <i>Corresp. of the Rev.</i>). On August 27th, Schuyler wrote to Washington that he was informed that "Carleton
and his agents are exerting themselves to procure the savages against us." While he did not believe that
Carleton would be successful except in procuring some of the remote Indians to act as scouts, he nevertheless
added, "I should, therefore, not hesitate a moment to employ any Indians that might be willing to join us"
(Lossing's <i>Schuyler</i>). Judge Drayton, of South Carolina, on September 25th addressed the Cherokee warriors
at Congaree in the following words: "So should we act to each other like brothers; so shall we be able
to support and assist each other against our common enemies; so shall we be able to stand together in perfect
safety against the evil men who in the end mean to ruin you, as well as ourselves, who are their own flesh
and blood." In January, 1776, Washington felt that the important moment had arrived when the Indians
must take a side. He knew that if the Indians concerning whom he wrote did not desire to be idle, they
would be "for or against us." "I am sensible", he added, "that no artifices will be left unessayed to engage
them against us." On April 19th he wrote to the President of Congress: "In my opinion it will be impossible
to keep them in a state of neutrality; they must, and no doubt soon will, take an active part either for
or against us. I submit to Congress whether it would not be better immediately to engage them on our side."
On July 13th he reported to the President of Congress that, without authority from Congress, he had directed
Gen. Schuyler to engage the Six Nations in our interest on the best terms he and his colleagues could procure.
"I trust", he added, "the urgency of the occasion will justify my proceeding to Congress." On the
day of the Declaration of Independence he again wrote to Congress, submitting the propriety of engaging the
Eastern Indians. Notwithstanding the various arguments against employing them, John Adams thought "we
need not be so delicate as to refuse the assistance of Indians, provided we cannot keep them neutral." In
June, the Rev. Samuel Kirkland said that the Indians were generally of opinion that it was impracticable for
them to continue longer in a state of neutrality. Gen. Schuyler, notwithstanding his early expressions of
readiness to "employ any Indians that might be willing to join us", seemed reluctant, when the time came, to
avail himself of their services. He preferred to get decently rid of the offer of the Caughnawagas rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
to employ them. As to the Six Nations, he evidently felt that the utmost to be hoped for was to hold a portion
of them quiet through the influence of such men as Kirkland and Deane.<a name="FNanchor_1415_1415" id="FNanchor_1415_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> Schuyler's labors as Indian commissioner
had been in the direction of neutrality; and even after direct instructions from Congress to engage
the Six Nations on the best terms that could be procured, he wrote in reply, with evident satisfaction, when
the news of the disaster to our forces in Canada was spread among the Indians, that "our conduct in demanding
a neutrality in all former treaties has been greatly applauded in all their councils." <i>The Life of Jonathan
Trumbull, Sen., Governor of Connecticut</i>, by I. W. Stuart (Boston, 1859), gives particulars concerning the
contact of this active participant in affairs with some of these questions of policy. Trumbull, as well as the
Massachusetts committeemen, was in correspondence with Major Brown in Canada, and through him as well
as through them information was conveyed to the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts Bay of rumors of a
projected attempt to recapture Ticonderoga and Crown Point with a force of regulars and Indians.</p>

<p class="pc1"><b>B.</b> EVENTS AT THE NORTH, NOT CONNECTED WITH THE SIX NATIONS.</p>

<p>Among the Western tribes, the Delawares were divided, but the majority of the Indians were unfriendly,
and completely under the influence of the English commander at Detroit. At the East the attitude of the
Indians was not so pronounced, and they were slow to move. On June 20, 1776, Washington wrote to Schuyler
that he was "hopeful the bounty Congress had agreed to allow and would prove a powerful inducement to engage
the Indians in our service." From Schuyler he learned that "our emissaries among the Indians all agree that
it would be extremely imprudent to take an active part with us, as they think it would effectually militate the
contrary way." The reference in Washington's letter to bounties applies to the resolution of Congress to
offer bounties, which had passed three days before the letter was written. With the same prompt attention
he wrote to the General Court of Massachusetts, transmitting the resolve of Congress authorizing the employment
of the Eastern Indians, exactly three days after its passage; at the same time he solicited the aid of
that body in carrying it into execution. He designated five or six hundred as the number which he wished
to have engaged. On the same day he wrote to the Continental Congress that he had communicated with
the General Court of Massachusetts Bay, "entreating their exertions to have the Eastern Indians forthwith
engaged and marched to join this army." It appears from the correspondence and from the proceedings at
the conferences that he had already written a letter to these Indians, and it chanced that his letter to the
Provincial Congress reached Watertown at about the same time that a delegation from the Eastern Indians
reported there in consequence of his letter to them. When the Indians were called upon to state by what
authority they spoke, they produced the letter from Washington, leaving it to be inferred that they were
accredited upon their mission in consequence of the letter having been received. At the conference which was
held with them they were full of high-sounding phrases of friendship. "We shall have nothing to do with
Old England", they said, "and all that we shall worship, or obey, will be Jesus Christ and George Washington."
The report of the conference states that "a silver gorget and heart, with the king's arms and bust
engraved on them, were delivered to the interpreter to be returned to the Indians. He presented them to their
speaker, but with great vehemence and displeasure he refused to take them, saying they had nothing to do
with King George and England; whereupon the President told them they should have a new gorget and
heart, with the bust of Gen. Washington and proper devices to represent the United Colonies." A treaty was
exchanged with these Indians on July 17, 1776, whereby they agreed to furnish six hundred Indians to a regiment
which was to be officered by the whites, and have in addition to the Indians two hundred and fifty white
soldiers. As a result of all this, the Massachusetts Council subsequently reported that seven Penobscot
Indians, all that could be procured, were enlisted in October for one year; and in November, Major Shaw
reported with a few Indians who had enlisted in the Continental service. The Council of Massachusetts Bay
expressed their regrets to Gen. Washington that the major had met with no better success. Washington's
letter to the Eastern nations appears to have contained advice to them to keep the peace if they concluded it
was to their advantage. These nations afterwards protested that the young men who in the character of chiefs
made the treaty of war acted without authority, and they therefore returned the treaty. This practically ended
efforts to secure alliance with Eastern Indians. There was further correspondence between Congress and
Washington concerning the Stockbridge Indians, in which Congress first announced that the enlistment of
these Indians must stop, and then at Washington's request permitted it to be renewed. Finally Congress was
content to instruct the government agent to engage the friendship of the Eastern Indians, "and prevent their
taking part in the unjust and cruel war against these United States."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc1"><b>C.</b> EVENTS AT THE SOUTH.</p>

<p>The first result of the struggle between Great Britain and the colonies for the friendship of the Indians was
felt in the North at St. John's and the Cedars. The first aggressive movement within the limits of the colonies
took place in the South. The correspondence of Sir James Wright traces the progress of events in that
department. The "Liberty People", as he says, asserted in June, 1775, that Stuart was endeavoring to raise
the Cherokees against them, and "all that Stuart could say would not convince them to the contrary." In
July Sir James heard that the Provincial Congress had agreed to send 2,000 pounds of gunpowder into the
Indian country as a present from the people, "not from the king, or from the government, or from the superintendent,
or from the traders, but from the people of the province."</p>

<p>This powder was seized by the royalists,
but as an offset the annual presents of Stuart were seized at Tybee by the "Liberty People." It was
stated that the best friends of Great Britain lived in the back parts of Carolina and Georgia. If the Indians
were put in motion, they, and not the rebels, would suffer. Nevertheless, the first blow from the Indians came
from that quarter. Early in July, 1776, news was received at Savannah, at Charleston, and at Fincastle, Va.,
that the Indians were at work upon the border, carrying destruction wherever they went. On the 7th of July,
General Lee wrote to the president of the Virginia Convention that an opportunity offered for a coöperative
movement. The Continental Congress, having received a report of the circumstances from the president of
South Carolina, recommended, on the 30th of July (1776), the States of Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia
to afford all necessary assistance. As soon as the first intelligence of the outbreak in South Carolina reached
Col. Andrew Williamson, who at the beginning of this campaign apparently ranked as major, he promptly
rallied the inhabitants of the frontier of that State. By the middle of July he had collected a body of 1,150
volunteers. With this force he invaded the Indian territory, and during the remainder of the month of July
and the first half of August he was occupied in destroying the Cherokee lower towns. On his return to his
main camp from a raid with a detachment, about the middle of August, he found that a number of his men
had gone home, and that many of those who remained were suffering for clothes and other necessaries. He
erected a fort at Essenecca, which he named after President Rutledge, and furloughed a part of his force until
August 28th.</p>

<p>At the same time that the depredations were committed which caused Col. Williamson to invade the Indian
country, the settlements in Virginia and North Carolina, on the border of what we now know as Tennessee,
were threatened by the Indians. The inhabitants along the border at once "forted" themselves. A small
force collected at Eaton's station met a party of Indians on the 20th of July, and repulsed them, with a loss
of thirteen of their warriors. Watauga, where 150 persons, of whom 40 were men, had assembled in the fort,
was besieged by another band. The Indians hung about the fort for six days, and skulked in the woods for a
fortnight longer, but left on the approach of a relief column. Other Indians went up the Holston to Carter's
Valley, but accomplished nothing in that immediate vicinity.<a name="FNanchor_1416_1416" id="FNanchor_1416_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a> The settlements in Virginia, in the Clinch
Valley and for a long distance from this point, were, however, raided, and the surrounding country devastated.</p>

<p>Georgia performed her share of the season's work simultaneously with Colonel Williamson's first raid. An
independent command, led by Major Jack,<a name="FNanchor_1417_1417" id="FNanchor_1417_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> operated against the lower towns beyond the Tugaloo, during the
latter part of July.</p>

<p>The work performed by South Carolina and Georgia during the months of July and August was not considered
complete. It was determined to inflict a blow which would be remembered. About the first of September
Colonel Williamson again marched into the Indian country, this time at the head of about two thousand
men. It was intended that on an appointed day in September he should effect a junction with General Rutherford
of North Carolina, who at the head of twenty-four hundred men simultaneously marched from that
State. Although the two columns met in Indian territory, the junction was not effected at the appointed date,
and the work of destroying the middle towns and valley settlements was independently performed. Virginia
sent out an expedition at the same time against the upper or over-hill towns. This force, after it was joined
by some companies from the northwestern portion of North Carolina, numbered eighteen hundred men, and
was commanded by Colonel William Christian. The purposes of this expedition were successfully accomplished.</p>

<p>The South Carolina troops had the misfortune to encounter nearly all the resistance that was offered by the
Indians, and the two expeditions lost 22 men killed, with 11 men mortally wounded, and 63 men otherwise
wounded. They had the satisfaction, however, of knowing that the joint expedition had thoroughly performed
its work. The Cherokee towns were burned, and the crops of the Indians were destroyed. The attack by the
Indians consolidated the colonists and aroused their indignation. The Council of South Carolina asserted
that they were now convinced of what they had before but little reason to doubt, "the indiscriminate atrocity
and unrelenting tyranny of the hand that directs the British war against us." The Assembly spoke of it as a
"barbarous and ungrateful attempt of the Cherokee Indians, instigated by our British enemies." The Cherokees
accepted such terms of peace as their conquerors allowed. Next year separate treaties were made between
representatives of the tribes and Virginia and North Carolina, and between other representatives and South
Carolina and Georgia. In the treaty in which South Carolina participated, a portion of the Indian territory was
ceded to that State on the ground of conquest. For several years thereafter the Indians kept so quiet that but
little was heard from them in that portion of the country. As a sequel to the campaign it may be noted that,
on the 25th of September, President Rutledge informed the Assembly of South Carolina that Colonel Williamson
desired instructions as to whether the Indians taken prisoners should become slaves. Such an impression
prevailed in camp, and one prisoner had already been sold as a slave.<a name="FNanchor_1418_1418" id="FNanchor_1418_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span></p>

<p>McCall, in his <i>History of Georgia</i>, is authority for the statement that General Rutherford was accompanied
on his march by a small band of Catawba Indians. In Virginia the matter of enlisting Indians was considered
in the Convention, and on the 21st of May, 1776, a resolution was passed to engage a number of warriors,
not to exceed two hundred. A few days afterward, however, the execution of this resolution was postponed
in such a way as to make it ineffective.</p>

<p>In January, 1777, Col. Nathaniel Gist was authorized by Congress to raise four companies of rangers, and
was instructed to proceed to the Cherokee or any other nation of Indians, and to attempt to procure a number
of warriors not exceeding five hundred, who were to be equipped by Congress and receive soldiers' pay.<a name="FNanchor_1419_1419" id="FNanchor_1419_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a></p>

<p>We have seen that in 1777 treaties were made with the Cherokees. The Indians at the Chickamauga settlements,
which were clustered along the Tennessee, below the site of Chattanooga, and near where the river crosses
the state line, had not participated in the treaties. In the interval between the joint campaign in the fall of
1776 and the spring of 1779 outrages had been committed by these Indians, and it was determined to punish
them. A thousand volunteers from the back settlements of North Carolina and Virginia assembled on the
banks of the Holston, in the northeastern part of Tennessee, a few miles above where Rogersville stands. Of
these Col. Evan Shelby had command. They were joined by a regiment of twelve-months men which belonged
to Colonel Clarke's Illinois expedition. On the 10th of April, 1779, this force embarked in dug-outs and
canoes, descended the rapid running stream, surprised the Indians, killed a number of them, burned eleven of
their towns, destroyed their provisions, and drove off or killed their cattle. All this having been accomplished
without a battle, the troops returned.</p>

<p>In 1780 the contribution of men by the border settlements of North Carolina to the force which fought the
battle of King's Mountain left those settlements exposed to Indian raids. As soon after the battle as possible
some of the men were sent to Watauga. They learned upon arrival that news had been received of an Indian
advance. Col. John Sevier organized an expedition against the Indians, and marched to meet them. The
number of volunteers thus hastily gathered together reached about one hundred and seventy. At the end of
the second day's march the Indians were discovered. They retreated, and the next day Sevier followed them.
The customary ambuscade was prepared by the Indians, but the American leader was too wary to be deceived.
On the contrary, he adopted their own tactics, and defeated them in a brief engagement at Boyd's Creek, in
which twenty-eight Indians were killed. A few days after this Colonel Sevier was joined by Col. Arthur
Campbell, with troops from Virginia. The united forces amounted to seven hundred men. They penetrated
the country to the southward, burning a number of Indian towns, and held a council with a large body of Cherokees.
After completing the expedition, a message was sent, on January 4, 1781, to the chiefs and warriors of
the Indians. It was signed by Col. Arthur Campbell, Lieut.-Col. John Sevier, and Joseph Martin, agent and
major of militia, and consisted of a summons to the Indians to send deputies to negotiate a treaty of peace at
the Great Island within two moons.<a name="FNanchor_1420_1420" id="FNanchor_1420_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a></p>

<p>Towards the end of August, 1780, Colonel Williamson and Colonel Pickens, of South Carolina, raided the
Indian territory and destroyed a large amount of stores. To prevent further depredations, the Indians were
compelled to remove their habitations to the settled towns of the Creeks.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1781 the Cherokees invaded the settlements on Indian Creek. Colonel Sevier called
for volunteers, and attacked them. He killed seventeen Indians and put the rest to flight.</p>

<p>Early in 1781 General Greene made a treaty with the Cherokees, by which they engaged to observe neutrality.
This treaty having been violated by the Indians during the summer, Gen. Andrew Pickens, at the head
of a mounted force of three hundred and ninety-four men, penetrated to the Cherokee country, burned thirteen
towns, killed upwards of forty Indians, and took a number of prisoners. McCall (<i>Georgia</i>, ii. 414)
thus summarizes Pickens's method of campaigning: "The general's whole command could not produce a
tent or any other description of camp equipage. After the small portion of bread which they could carry in
their saddle-bags was exhausted, they lived upon parched corn, potatoes, peas, and beef without salt, which
they collected in the Indian towns." Soon after this expedition some of the Creeks and Cherokees again
invaded Georgia. They were met beyond Oconee River by Colonel Clarke and by Col. Robert Anderson, of
Pickens's brigade, and were driven back. Major John Habersham was sent out by Wayne on an expedition,
and his report, Feb. 8, 1782, is in <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, iv. 129. In February, 1782, Governor Martin addressed a letter
to Colonel Martin and Colonel Sevier, instructing them to drive intruders off the Cherokee lands.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1782 a body of Indians crossed the State of Georgia without being discovered,
and on the morning of the 24th of June surprised General Wayne's command. After the first flush of success
attendant upon the surprise had been overcome by the Americans, they repulsed the Indians, with
the loss of fourteen killed, among whom was one of their chiefs. The kind treatment of some prisoners who
were taken aided in detaching the Indians from the British side.</p>

<p>In September, 1782, the upper-town Cherokees, in a talk, complained piteously of the intruders upon their
lands, and said they had done nothing to break the last treaty. At the same time, other Indians of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>
tribes began depredations. Colonel Sevier, with one hundred volunteers, marched into the Indian country, held
a conference with the friendly Indians, and punished those who were hostile by burning their villages.</p>

<p>The Southern campaigns against the Indians have not been treated as fully in local and general histories as
those against the Northern tribes. The policy of the several leaders in these campaigns was not entitled, perhaps,
to the same recognition as has been awarded to that which governed the Sullivan campaign. The several
columns from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia each burned Indian towns and devastated
Indian crops, but the plan was not directed by the general in command of the national armies. There
have been but few local historians in the South who have searched for diaries, journals, and letters containing
details of such affairs. At the time when the centennial anniversaries of these events might fitly have been
celebrated by the publication of such original material as could be found, there was not the same disposition
in the South to be grateful for the results of the Revolutionary War as then prevailed in the North. Further
than that, the materials from which such contributions to history are generally made had been scattered and
destroyed during the civil war. For these reasons, the number of books which treat of the border wars in the
South is small.</p>

<p>The most complete accounts of the attacks upon the Cherokee settlements which have been published are
to be found in the histories of Tennessee. John Haywood's <i>Civil and Political History of the State of Tennessee
from its earliest Settlement up to the year 1796</i>, etc. (Knoxville, 1823), is an extensive collection of
facts concerning the various raids of the Indians and the counter attacks upon their scattered settlements,
which has been freely used by subsequent writers. J. G. M. Ramsey, in his <i>Annals of Tennessee to the end
of the eighteenth Century: Comprising its settlement as the Watauga Association from 1769 to 1777; A
part of North Carolina from 1777 to 1784</i> (Charlestown, 1853), relies to a great extent upon Haywood, and
acknowledges his obligation by frequent references in his footnotes. In the preparation of this work, Mr.
Ramsey says that he had access to the journals and papers of his father, a pioneer of the country, and also to
the papers of Sevier, of Shelby, the Blounts, and other public men. He examined the papers of all the old
Franklin Counties and the public archives at Milledgeville, Raleigh, Richmond, and Nashville.</p>

<p>Haywood says the Georgia expedition was commanded by Col. Leonard McBury. Ramsey follows Haywood
in this regard. All the other accounts say that Major or Colonel Jack was in command.</p>

<p>The campaign of the Virginia column is briefly described in Girardin's continuation of Berk's <i>History of
Virginia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1421_1421" id="FNanchor_1421_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a> Brief allusions to this campaign are made in Wheeler's <i>Historical Sketches of North Carolina</i>,
and in Martin's <i>History of North Carolina</i>. The story is more fully told in an <i>Historical Sketch of the Indian
War of 1776</i>, by D. L. Swain, which is reprinted from the <i>North Carolina University Magazine</i> (May,
1852) in the <i>Historical Magazine</i> (Nov., 1867, p. 273). This account states that there were "three armies
simultaneously fitted out by Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina", but makes no mention of the work
which the Georgia contingent had already performed.</p>

<p>A journal kept during the Williamson expeditions was published in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, vol. xii. (Oct.,
1867, p. 212), by Professor E. F. Rockwell, of North Carolina, as "Parallel and combined expedition against
the Cherokee Indians in South and North Carolina in 1776." The writer describes the houses in the Cherokee
towns as follows: "Their dwelling-houses is made some one way and some another. Some is made with saplings
stuck in the ground upright; then laths tide on these with splits of cane or such like; So with daubing
outside and in with mud merely, they finish a close warm building. They have no chimnies, and their fires
are all in the middle of the houses."</p>

<p>C. L. Hunter, in <i>Sketches of Western North Carolina, Historical and Biographical, illustrating principally
the Revolutionary period</i>, etc. (Raleigh, 1877), under "General Griffith Rutherford" gives a brief
account of the march against the middle towns, and under "Colonel Isaac Shelby" he gives a paragraph to
the expedition against the Chickamaugas in 1779.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the Cherokee outbreak in the South was the first aggressive movement made by the
Indians during the Revolutionary War, and that this fact has caused the joint attack of the colonies to be
noticed in the general histories of the times. It naturally finds a place in Moultrie's <i>Memoirs</i> and in Ramsay's
<i>South Carolina</i>, but without detail. If we turn to Drayton's <i>Memoirs</i> we shall find an extended account of
the expeditions of Colonel Williamson, who commanded the South Carolina troops, in the summer of 1776,
when they ravaged the Cherokee settlements,&mdash;the campaigns being illustrated by a map of which a fac-simile
is given herewith. Several letters are published in the Appendix as authorities. The movements of Major
Jack in Georgia are given (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 313), and some account of the march of General Rutherford's army from
North Carolina and of the attempts at coöperation. It is stated (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 353) that Virginia also raised an
army, but no account of the movement of the troops is given.</p>

<p>The <i>American Archives</i> contain reprints of letters from several points in the South, which enable us to
trace the history of most of these movements. We have rumors of the outbreak from various places scattered
from Georgia to Virginia; stories of the siege of Watauga and of the gathering of the Indians in Carter's
Valley; accounts of the desolation along the frontier; of the marches of Rutherford and of Williamson; of
the speech of Rutledge, and of the replies of the Council and of the Assembly of South Carolina.</p>

<p>The <i>Remembrancer</i> also reprints some of these letters. Drayton, in his <i>Memoirs</i> (ii. p. 212), says that Col.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
Bull, in March, 1776, marched to Savannah with four hundred Carolina troops, "to awe the disaffected, to support
the Continental regulations, and in particular to prevent the merchant ships from going to sea." These
troops were accompanied by some Georgia militia and by "about seventy men of the Creek and Euchee Indians."
In corroboration of this statement Drayton cites the <i>Remembrancer</i> (1776, Part ii. pp. 333, 334),
where is a letter from Charleston, which opens, "By a remarkable Providence, the Creek Indians have engaged
in our favour." It then goes on to describe how they became enraged with the Tories because they destroyed
the house of a white man with whom the Indians were friendly, and adds that "they have brought down 500,
who have killed several men of the fleet."</p>

<p>Another reference to the use of Indians by the Americans will be found in McCall's <i>Georgia</i> (ii. p. 82),
where he says that General Rutherford was "joined by the Catawba Indians."</p>

<p>Various accounts of events connected with these campaigns will be found in the <i>Remembrancer</i> (Part ii.,
1776, pp. 286, 319-334; and Part iii., 1776, pp. 50, 252-274, and 275), including a letter, Sept. 4th, which says:
"The colonel's (Williamson's) next object will be the middle towns, where he expects to be joined by General
Rutherford with 200 [2,000?] North Carolinians. Colonel Lewis, of Virginia, will go against the upper or over
hill settlements, so that we have no doubt the savages will be effectually chastised."</p>

<p>The treaty at De Witt's Corner, May 20, 1777, between South Carolina, Georgia, and the Cherokees was
printed in the <i>Boston Gazette and Country Journal</i>, Aug. 18, 1777.</p>

<p>A description of the Cherokee lower towns and of the siege of Watauga is given by Edmund Kirke (James
R. Gilmore) in <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i> (July and August, 1855), in a paper on "The Pioneers of the South
West." Bare mention is made of the fact that Georgia participated in the campaign of 1776, by Stevens in
his <i>Georgia</i>, who follows Moultrie in assigning the command of the Georgia troops to Colonel Jack.</p>

<p>McCall, in his <i>History of Georgia</i>, gives a curious account of an attempt by a party of Americans to penetrate
the Indian country and seize Cameron. Their leader, Capt. James McCall, had with him two officers,
twenty-two Carolinians, and eleven Georgians. They were suspected by the Indians of treachery, and were
themselves attacked. Their leader was captured and several of the men were killed, but the greater number
escaped, and after severe sufferings reached the settlements. Drayton (<i>Memoirs</i>, ii. 338) states that this expedition
of McCall's was forwarded in consequence of an agreement on the part of the Cherokees in June to
permit the arrest of refugees in their towns. The attack was therefore a piece of treachery on the part of the
Indians. McCall himself escaped shortly afterward, and joined the Virginia column of invasion. He again
made an attempt to seize Cameron. This time he reached the Indian town where Cameron had his headquarters,
but the latter had left for Mobile the morning that Captain McCall arrived at the town. McCall gives an
account of a raid by General Pickens in the fall of 1782. This apparently is the same as the one described
in 1781.</p>

<p>C. C. Jones's <i>Georgia</i> deals with the border wars to about the same extent as McCall. The precise time of
Jack's raid is not given, but Jones has followed those who have spoken of it as simultaneous with the joint
movement in Virginia and North and South Carolina, among whom we find Ramsay in his <i>History of the Revolution
of South Carolina</i>. A letter to Gov. Bullock, from B. Rea, July 3, 1776 (<i>Remembrancer</i>, Part iii.,
1776, p. 50), says: "I shall order the draft that has been made of this regiment to Broad River and Ogeechee
as soon as possible, but not to go over the line till I receive your excellency's orders, which I shall wait
for with impatience. I shall likewise be glad to know how far we are to act in concert with the Carolinians, or
if we are only to guard our own frontiers." This shows that troops were put in the field by Georgia before
the question of coöperation was raised, but that it immediately suggested itself as a possibility.</p>

<p>It will be inferred from what has been said that confusion of dates as to the movement of the troops exists.
McCall tells the story as if Jack's march in the middle of July were part of a preconcerted plan, in which South
Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia participated. Jones, as has been seen, follows him in this respect.
Ramsey, in his <i>Annals of Tennessee</i>, says Christian went into the field on the 1st of August. Williamson,
on his second raid, and Rutherford started out about the 1st of September. Christian's march was evidently
in coöperation with them, and doubtless at the same time, although in Foote's <i>Sketches of Virginia</i> it is said
(pp. 118, 119) that Col. William Christian's campaign against the Cherokees was in October. It is probable
that he did not return to the settlements until that month.</p>

<p>It is evident that the attack upon the lower towns of the Cherokees by the Georgia militia was not regarded
at the time as a part of the joint concerted movement. On the 5th of August President Rutledge issued a
proclamation requiring the Legislative Council and General Assembly to meet at Charleston on the 17th of
September, at which time his excellency congratulated them on the success of the troops under Colonel Williamson,
and added, "It has pleased God to grant very signal success to their operations; and I hope by his
blessings on our arms, and those of North Carolina and Virginia, from whom I have promises of aid, an end
may soon be put to this war." In the replies of the Council and of the Assembly recognition is made of the
coöperative movements of the North Carolina and Virginia forces. No reference is made in any of these proceedings
to the Georgia contingent.</p>

<p>The <i>Boston Gazette and Country Journal</i>, Sept. 16, 1776, contains an account of the outbreak in North
Carolina, which says: "The ruined settlers had collected themselves together at different places and forted
themselves: 400 and upwards at Major Shelby's, about the same number at Captain Campbell's, and a considerable
number at Amos Eaton's." It then describes the relief of Watauga by Colonel Russell with three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
hundred men. The acts of these men and the first raid of Williamson were the spontaneous movements of the
frontier inhabitants. The participation of Georgia was inspired from headquarters at Augusta, with intelligent
comprehension of the value of coöperation. The campaigns of the month of September were concerted.</p>

<p>The raid of Gen. Andrew Pickens is described in Ramsay's <i>South Carolina</i> and in Henry Lee's <i>Memoirs</i>,
the account in the latter being copied in Cecil B. Hartley's <i>Heroes and Patriots of the South</i> (Philad., 1860).
The raid of Col. Arthur Campbell is described in Girardin's continuation of Burk's <i>Virginia</i> (iv. p. 472).
Campbell's report, in the <i>Calendar of the State Papers of Virginia</i> (i. p. 434), says that he destroyed upwards
of one thousand houses, and not less than fifty thousand bushels of corn and a large quantity of other provisions.</p>

<p class="pc1"><b>D.</b> CONNECTICUT SETTLERS IN PENNSYLVANIA.</p>

<p>In 1768, the Proprietaries of Pennsylvania secured an Indian deed for the territory already claimed by the
Susquehanna Company of Connecticut, and a lease was executed, which vested in certain enterprising individuals
the rights of the Proprietaries to this region, whether gained by royal grant or by purchase. This was
followed by simultaneous preparation on the part of the Pennsylvanian lessees and of the Connecticut Company
for the occupation by settlers, who were expected to defend their rights against other claimants. The
Pennsylvanians were first on the ground, and in January, 1769, built a block-house on the land which had
been improved by former Connecticut settlers. Early in February the first detachment of colonists from Connecticut
arrived, and then began the contest for possession, which was waged, with success alternating on either
side, until the fall of 1771. Houses were burned, crops were laid waste, cattle were driven off and killed, and
there was some bloodshed during the progress of these hostilities. Proclamations were put forth by the
governor of Pennsylvania, and warrants were issued by the courts of that province for the arrest of the Connecticut
leaders for the crime of arson. The several military expeditions of the Pennsylvanians were generally
accompanied by a sheriff, whose mission was supposed to be to execute the laws. The citizens of that
province do not appear to have been in sympathy with the lessees of the Proprietaries. If they had been, it
would have been easy to have crushed the Connecticut colony. This settlement was not at the outset recognized
as a part of Connecticut. Permission had been given the company to apply to his majesty for a separate
charter. The expectation that an independent government might perhaps be formed, and the opposition
to the movement already expressed at London, explain the supineness of the mother colony. The Susquehanna
settlement depended for its life upon the efforts of the company. Five townships were laid out, and
liberal offers of shares in the lands were made to the first settlers in each of them. Three more townships
were subsequently settled on the same plan. These inducements had attracted settlers in such numbers that
the Pennsylvanian lessees could not dispossess them. In the autumn of 1771 the Pennsylvanians withdrew,
leaving the Connecticut colonists, for the time, in undisturbed possession. Some correspondence followed between
the authorities of the colonies, in which the government of Pennsylvania sought to ascertain how far
the colony of Connecticut backed up the emigrants; and the governor of that colony in reply denied having
authorized any hostile demonstration, but carefully avoided saying anything which could be interpreted as a
relinquishment on the part of the colony of its rights under the charter to the land. During the next two
years the settlement, although looked upon by Pennsylvania as an invasion and not as yet acknowledged by
Connecticut, increased in numbers and prospered. Meetings of the Proprietors were occasionally held, at
which the affairs of the towns were adjusted in a general way, authority being delegated to a committee of
settlers to act in the intervals between the meetings. In June, 1773, the company adopted at Hartford a form
of government for the settlers, stating in the preamble that "we have as yet no established civil authority
residing among us in the settlement." In October the Connecticut Assembly resolved that the colony would
"make their claim to these lands, and in a legal manner support the same." Commissioners were appointed,
and fruitless negotiations were opened with Pennsylvania. In January, 1774, the territory of Susquehanna
Company was incorporated into the town of Westmoreland, and became temporarily a part of the
county of Litchfield, Connecticut. Almost simultaneously, proclamations were issued by the governors of the
two colonies, each prohibiting settlements on the disputed territory except under authority of the colony which
he represented. Meantime the settlements in the valley increased. In September, 1775, about eighty settlers,
who had just arrived on the west branch of the Susquehanna, were attacked by the Pennsylvania militia. One
man was killed; several were wounded; and the men of the Connecticut party were taken prisoners to Sunbury.
Upon receipt of this news the Continental Congress, in November, passed resolutions urging the two
colonies to take steps to avoid open hostilities. This was, however, of no effect. Boats from Wyoming,
loaded with the property of settlers, were seized and confiscated at Fort Augusta. During the fall, extensive
preparations were made by the Pennsylvanians for an invasion of Wyoming, under authority from Governor
Penn, for the purpose of enforcing the laws of Pennsylvania. In December, Congress expressed the opinion
that all appearance of force ought to stop until the dispute could be decided by law; but at the time that the
resolution expressing this opinion was under consideration, an army of Pennsylvanians, accompanied by a
sheriff, was already invading the valley. The Connecticut people, having been forewarned, successfully resisted
this military posse. Several lives were lost in this attempt of the Pennsylvanians to dispossess the colonists.
With this failure the attempts of Pennsylvania to expel the Connecticut settlers by force ended. The Revolutionary
War was now in progress. Connecticut needed her able-bodied men. She now forbade further settlement
on the disputed territory unless licensed by her Assembly.</p>

<p>The Trumbull MSS. in possession of the Mass. Hist. Soc. contain copies of the papers connected with the
discussion of the title of the colony to its settlement in the Susquehanna Valley. There is probably no single
collection of papers so rich in this direction.</p>

<p class="pc1"><b>E.</b> JOURNALS AND DIARIES OF THE SULLIVAN EXPEDITION.</p>

<p>A list of the journals of Sullivan's expedition was prepared by the writer of this chapter for publication in
the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Oct., 1886, and this list in an extended and revised form was to be appended here;
but the repetition is rendered unnecessary by the publication of an elaborate volume by the State of New York,
<i>Journals of the military expedition of Major-General John Sullivan against the Six Nations of Indians
in 1779, with records of Centennial Celebrations</i>,&mdash;compiled by George S. Conover, under the direction of
Frederick Cook, Secretary of State. It reprints, and in some cases gives for the first time in type, the journals
of twenty-six participants, pertaining either to the main expedition or to that against the Onondagas. An
enumeration is also given of the journals known to have existed, but no longer to be found.</p>

<p>Appended to the journals are the reports of Sullivan, Brodhead, and a roster of the expeditionary army.
The main historical narrative is an elaborate account, compacted from four centennial addresses, given by the
Rev. David Craft in 1879, and revised from the original publication in the <i>Centennial Proceedings</i> of the
Waterloo (N. Y.) Library and Historical Society. In a note it is shown that a collation of all the journals
supports Sullivan's statements in his official report, making his total loss in the campaign 41 men, while 41
Indian settlements or towns were destroyed.</p>

<p>The portraits of the book are those of Sullivan (with the spear), General Clinton (profile), Gansevoort (by
Stuart), and Philip Van Cortlandt. The rest of the volume describes the various centennial celebrations in
1879, at Elmira, Waterloo, Geneseo, and Aurora, with the addresses, principal among which is one by Erastus
Brooks on "Indian History and Wars", and another by Major Douglass Campbell on "The Iroquois and New
York's Indian policy."</p>

<p>The maps include one by Gen. John S. Clark of the battlefield of Newtown (not far from Elmira) and the
Chemung Ambuscade; another, by the same, of the Groveland Ambuscade, near Conesus Lake, and the route
thence to the Genessee; five maps of as many sections of Sullivan's route, surveyed by Lieutenant Benjamin
Lodge, the originals of which make a part of the collection of maps made by Robert Erskine, the topographical
engineer of the Continental army, and by his successor, Simeon De Witt, and now in the cabinet of the
N. Y. Hist. Society. Gen. J. S. Clark, in describing these maps, says that the route of Dearborn on the west
side of Cayuga Lake, and General Clinton's descent of the N. E. branch of the Susquehanna, do not appear
to have been surveyed, but that Clinton's route is well illustrated in a sketch of Col. William Butler's march
(Oct.-Nov., 1778) made by Capt. William Gray, which is also included in the volume. The five maps above
referred to are reproductions from the originals, with some names added from the rough preliminary sketches,
also preserved in the same collection. A rough plan of Tioga, in fac-simile of a drawing in the journal of
Capt. Charles Nukerck, is also given.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p class="pc1"><b>F.</b> BOUNTIES FOR SCALPS.</p>

<p>It has been stated in the narrative that the colonies themselves were partially responsible for the low estimate
in which Indians were held by the inhabitants of the frontiers. Bounties had been so frequently offered
for the destruction of wild animals and of Indians that the border settlers might well infer that the law drew
no distinction between the savage and the brute. Mrs. Jackson, in her <i>Century of Dishonor</i> (App. p. 406),
quotes from Gale's <i>Upper Mississippi</i> (p. 112) a vigorous denunciation of the acts of the governments in
granting bounties for scalps: "In the history of the Indian tribes in the Northwest, the reader will at once
perceive that there was a constant rivalry between the governments of Great Britain, France, and the United
States as to which of them should secure the services of the barbarians to scalp their white enemies, while each
in turn was the loudest to denounce the shocking barbarities of such tribes as they failed to secure in their
own service. And the civilized world, aghast at these horrid recitals, ignores the fact that nearly every important
massacre in the history of North America was organized and directed by agents of some one of these
governments." One or two instances, taken from the records by way of illustration, will suffice to show how
the settlers along the frontier and legislators reciprocally viewed this subject. In November, 1724, John
Lovewell, Josiah Farwell, and Jonathan Robbins, presented a "Humble Memorial" to the General Court of
Massachusetts Bay, in which they set forth that they, with forty or fifty others, were "inclinable to range and
keep out in the woods for several months together, in order to kill and destroy their Indian enemy, provided they
could meet with incouragement suitable." For five shillings a day, and such other reward as the government
should see cause to give them, they would "employ themselves in Indian hunting one whole year." On the
17th of November, the General Court by vote authorized the formation of the company, the men to receive
"two shillings and sixpence per diem, the sum of one hundred pounds for each male scalp, and the other
premiums established by law to volunteers without pay or subsistence" (Kidder's <i>Captain John Lovewell</i>, pp.
11, 12). Col. Johnson, in 1747, was "quite pestered every day with parties returning with prisoners and scalps,
and without a penny to pay them with" (Stone's <i>Sir William Johnson</i>, i. 255, 342). For the outlay made in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
behalf Col. Johnson was ultimately reimbursed by the province of New York. In the memorial or representation
of their case, submitted by the rioters who murdered the Conestega Indians to the authorities at Philadelphia,
it is written: "Sixthly. In the late Indian war, this Province, with others of his Majesty's colonies,
gave rewards for Indian scalps, to encourage the seeking them in their own country, as the most likely means
of destroying or reducing them to reason; but no such encouragement has been given in this war, which has
damped the spirits of many brave men, who are willing to venture their lives in parties against the enemy.
We therefore pray that public rewards may be proposed for Indian scalps, which may be adequate to the
dangers attending enterprises of this nature." On the 12th of June, 1764, the authorities of Pennsylvania
offered bounties for scalps, presumably in response to this petition (<i>Penna. Col. Rec.</i>, ix. 141, 189).</p>

<p>On the 27th of September, 1776, a committee reported to the South Carolina Assembly, that it was "not
advisable to hold Captive Indians as Slaves, but as an encouragement to those who shall distinguish themselves
in the war against the Cherokees, they recommended the following rewards, to wit: For every Indian man
killed, upon certificate thereupon given by the Commanding Officer, and the scalp produced as evidence
thereof in Charlestown by the forces in the pay of the State, seventy-five pounds currency; For every Indian
man prisoner one hundred pounds like money" (<i>American Archives</i>, 5th ser., iii. 32).</p>

<p>It is true that bounties had previously been offered in New York for scalps taken from the "enemy", but at
the time of the Revolution New York and Massachusetts had apparently abandoned the policy of offering
bounties for scalps. Abundant records show that they had been committed to this policy in earlier times.
The Act of Assembly in South Carolina, the previous legislation in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Maryland, and Virginia, and the subsequent legislation in Pennsylvania and Illinois, were directed
exclusively against Indians. <i>Penna. Colonial Records</i> (xii. 311; xii. 632; xiii. 201). <i>Laws of the Colonial and
State Governments relating to Indians and Indian Affairs from 1633 to 1831 inclusive, with an appendix
containing the proceedings of the Congress of the Confederation and the laws of Congress from 1800 to 1830
on the Same Subject</i> (Washington city, 1832), p. 239. In the <i>Pennsylvania Archives</i> (iii. p. 199) there is a
curious letter from the superintendent of Indian affairs in the Southern Department to the governor of Maryland,
dated June 30, 1757, in which he says that several of the colonies are becoming fond of giving large rewards
for scalps. If these rewards were confined to their own people he should consider it laudable, but as
they are offered chiefly to Indians the case is very different. He says the Indians make several scalps out of one.
The Cherokees in particular make four scalps out of one man killed. "Here are now", he adds, "twenty
scalps hanging out to publick view which are well known to have been made out of five Frenchmen killed.
What a sum (at £50 each) would they produce if carried to Maryland, where the artifice would not probably
be discovered!" In early times in Maryland, the proof required from persons who had killed Indians, in order
that the reward might be claimed, was the production of the right ear of the dead Indian. There was less
opportunity to subdivide the ears, and thus multiply the bounties. The charge that the English paid bounties
for scalps thus found its way naturally into the histories, and the officers who had been disciplined in the previous
wars were probably ready to make such offers. Doddridge (<i>Notes</i>, 274) expresses the belief current on
the frontier when he says, "The English government made allies of as many of the Indian nations as they could,
and they imposed no restraint on their savage mode of warfare. On the contrary, the commandants at their
posts along our Western frontiers received and paid the Indians for scalps and prisoners, thus, the skin of a
white man's or even a woman's head served in the hands of the Indian as current coin, which he exchanged
for arms and ammunition, for the further prosecution of his barbarous warfare." This belief found expression
at the time, and worked its way into print. The <i>Remembrancer</i> gives a letter from Capt. Joseph Bowman
"at a place called Illinois Kaskaskias, upon the Mississippi", dated July 30, 1778, in which we read: "The
Indians meeting with daily supplies from the British officers, who offer them large bounties for our scalps"
(<i>Remembrancer</i>, viii. p. 83). There is, however, better authority than rumors of this class to justify those
authors who repeat this statement. When Governor Hamilton was captured at Vincennes, he was sent
to Williamsburg, and his conduct was investigated by the Council of Virginia. In their report the Council say,
"The board find that Governor Hamilton gave standing rewards for scalps, but offered none for prisoners,
which induced the Indians, after making the captives carry their baggage into the neighborhood of the fort,
there to put them to death, and carry in their scalps to the governor, who welcomed their return and success
by a discharge of cannon" (<i>Memoir, Correspondence, and Miscellanies from the Papers of Thomas Jefferson</i>,
ed. by Thomas Jefferson Randolph, Boston, 1830; 2d ed., vol. i. p. 456). Thus the official sanction of a board
composed of prominent men of good reputation has been given to the statement. In weighing the value of
this decision we must not forget that Hamilton was the special object of hatred to the Virginians. Col. George
Rogers Clarke, in an official communication to the governor of Virginia, from Kaskaskia, Feb. 3, 1779, speaks
of "A late meneuv<sup>r</sup> of the Famous Hair Buyer General Henry Hamilton, Esqr., Lieut.-Governour of De
Troit", etc., etc. (<i>Calendar of the State Papers of Virginia</i>, p. 315). C. W. Butterfield edited a reprint of <i>A
Short Biography of John Leith</i> (Lancaster, Ohio, 1831) as <i>Leith's Narrative</i> (Cincinnati, 1883), and in this
new edition (p. 39) we find an account of a brutal murder, by Indians, of a prisoner at Sandusky: "They
knocked him down with tomahawks, cut off his head, and fixed it on a pole erected for the purpose; when
commenced a scene of yelling, dancing, singing, and rioting." To this part of Leith's narrative the annotator
attaches a note, in which he states that a part of the "importance of this recital is in a historical sense;"
"that captives were brought to the points contiguous to Detroit, and then tomahawked and scalped, the direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
result of Hamilton's barbarous policy of offering rewards for scalps, but paying none for prisoners." The
language of the note is ambiguous, but a natural interpretation of its purpose would be that the statement in
the text was relied upon to prove the charges against Hamilton. I presume this prisoner was scalped,&mdash;it
would probably have been recorded by Leith as a remarkable event if he had escaped being scalped,&mdash;but a
statement which omits mention of the fact can hardly be cited as evidence against Hamilton.</p>

<p>The Virginia Council, while they published no evidence bearing upon the question of Hamilton's buying
scalps, were more explicit when it came to his inciting Indians to acts of war:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Williamsburgh, Va. In Council, June 16, 1779. Case of Hamilton, Dejaine La Mothe." "They find
that Hamilton has executed the task of inciting the Indians to perpetrate their accustomed cruelties on the
citizens of these States, without distinction of age, sex, or condition, with an eagerness and activity which
evince that the general nature of his charge harmonized with his particular disposition; they should have
been satisfied, from the other testimony adduced, that these enormities were committed by savages acting under
his commission, but the number of his Proclamations, which at different times were left in houses, the inhabitants
of which were killed or Carried away by Indians, one of which Proclamations, under the hand and
seal of Governor Hamilton, is in possession of the Board, puts the fact beyond doubt", etc. (<i>Remembrancer</i>,
viii. p. 337). "The narrative of the Capture and treatment of John Dodge by the English at Detroit" was
made public about the same time (<i>Remembrancer</i>, viii. p. 73). The portion of Dodge's story which relates
to the reception by Hamilton of Indians returning with scalps and prisoners, bears a striking resemblance to
the report of the Council. Dodge states that Hamilton become so enraged at him that the governor "offered
£100 for his scalp or his body." In another place he says: "These sons of Britain offered no reward for
prisoners, but they gave the Indians twenty dollars a scalp", etc., etc.; and again: "One of these parties returning
with a number of women and children's scalps and their prisoners, they were met by the commandant
of the fort, and after the usual demonstrations of joy, delivered their scalps, for which they were paid."</p>

<p>Some correspondence passed between Jefferson and the governor of Detroit on the question of Hamilton's
treatment as a prisoner, in which Jefferson dwells at length upon Hamilton's responsibility for the acts of the
Indians, but it is to be remarked that no charge is made against Hamilton of paying bounties for scalps
(<i>Calendar of State Papers of Virginia</i>, i. p. 321). Before the British government is finally convicted of
having offered bounties for scalps, it is just that other evidence should be adduced than such affidavits as that
of Moses Younglove (Campbell, <i>Tryon County</i>, 2d ed., p. 116), who swears that he "was informed by several
sergeants-orderly for General St. Leger that twenty dollars were offered in general orders for every American
scalp." The mere showing of scalps at headquarters does not necessarily imply that the Indians were to be
paid for them (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 307). According to Campbell (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 117), Col. Gansevoort, in a letter, confirms the
statement that twenty dollars were offered by St. Leger for every American scalp. Col. Gansevoort, besieged
in Fort Stanwix, relied of course upon some other person for this statement. It is probably the Younglove
story in another shape. It must not be forgotten that St. Leger ordered Lt. Bird "not to accept a capitulation,
because the force of whites under Bird's command was not large enough to restrain the Indians from barbarity
and carnage."</p>

<p>It adds little force to the evidence that we find similar allegations against the British in the class of books
represented by Seaver's <i>Life of Mary Jemison</i> (p. 114), (various editions,&mdash;see Field's <i>Indian Bibliography</i>,
nos. 1,380-81). In a similar manner, Simms (<i>Frontiersmen</i>, i. p. 10) cites a letter-writer as saying that the
price per scalp was eight dollars; and Jenkins (<i>Wyoming Memorial</i>, p. 151) charges Burgoyne with opening
a market for scalps at ten dollars each. Simms (<i>Schoharie County</i>, p. 578) says that a certificate, signed by
John Butler, concerning certain scalps taken by "Kayingwaarto, the Sanakee chief", was found upon the body
of an Indian killed during the Sullivan campaign. The details of the descriptions easily enable us to identify
the scalps referred to in the certificate. An excellent local authority (Ketchum's <i>Buffalo</i>, i. 327, 329) analyzes
the story thus "Gi-en-gwah-toh in Seneca is identical with Say-en-qua-ragh-ta in Mohawk, and is another spelling
of the name in the certificate.... It is historically certain that the age, if nothing else, would preclude
the possibility of Sayenquaraghta's being the person who wounded and scalped Capt. Greg and his corporal
near Fort Stanwix in 1778. And it is equally certain that Sayenquaraghta was not killed by a scouting party
of Sullivan's army in 1779, but was alive and well at Niagara in 1780, and came to reside at Buffalo Creek in
1781." The incident sought to be identified with this receipt was not only one of the most striking among
the events of the border war, but the Indian actor appears to have been equally prominent. Butler makes
especial mention of Brant and Kiangarachta&mdash;probably the same name as Gi-en-gwah-toh or Sayenquaraghta&mdash;in
his account of the battle of Newtown (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>).</p>

<p>If we are forced to such evidence as this against the British government, we unfortunately find ourselves
confronted with testimony of a like character against the Americans. Guy Johnson writes to Germain (<i>N. Y.
Col. Docs.</i>, viii. 740): "Some of the American colonies went further by fixing a price for scalps." Again it is
said (<i>Amer. Archives</i>, 4th, v. 1102): "Seneca sachems assert that Oneidas want Butler's scalp, and that General
Schuyler offered $250 for his person or scalp." Thomas Gummersall declared at Staten Island, Aug. 6,
1776 (<i>Amer. Archives</i>, 5th, i. 866), that "Mr. Schuyler, a rebel general, invited Sir John Johnson down, promising
him protection, and at the same time employed the Indian messenger, in case he refused, to bring his
scalp, for which he was to have a reward of one hundred dollars." It might, perhaps, be claimed that the
bounties offered by South Carolina justified the first of these counter-assertions by the English, but I presume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
there would be no hesitation in classing these statements, as a whole, among those which were especially prepared
for the purpose of influencing public opinion.</p>

<p>Before leaving this subject, the reader may need to be warned against a fabrication of Franklin, which has
deceived many. Sparks speaks of Franklin "occasionally amusing himself in composing and printing, by
means of a small set of types and a press he had in his house, several of his light essays, <i>bagatelles</i>, or <i>jeux
d'esprit</i>, written chiefly for the amusement of his friends. Among these were the following, printed on a half-sheet
of coarse paper, so as to imitate as much as possible a portion of a Boston newspaper", which he gave
out as a <i>Supplement to the Boston Independent Chronicle</i> of March 12, 1782. This pretended newspaper
contained what purported to be an extract from a letter from Captain Gerrish, of the New England militia,
dated Albany, March 7, 1782, which reads as follows: "The peltry taken in the expedition will, you see,
amount to a good deal of money. The possession of this booty at first gave us pleasure; but we were struck
with horror to find among the packages eight large ones, containing scalps of our unhappy country-folks, taken
prisoners in the three last years by the Seneka Indians from the inhabitants of the frontiers of New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and sent by them as a present to Colonel Haldimand, governor of
Canada, in order to be by him transmitted to England. They were accompanied by the following curious letter
to that gentleman;" which is given under the signature of James Crawfurd, and affords a detailed account
of the contents of each package. This fictitious Supplement was reprinted as genuine in Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>.
In the first edition of Campbell's <i>Annals of Tryon County</i> it was printed in the Appendix as genuine,
and copied from a newspaper published in Dutchess County during the Revolution (<i>Ibid.</i>, 2d ed., 307).
It was also reprinted in <i>Rhode Island Historical Tracts</i> (no. 7, p. 94, note I). It was exposed by Sparks, by
Parton in his <i>Life of Franklin</i> (ii. p. 437), by Campbell in his second edition of the <i>Annals of Tryon County</i>,
and by Col. Stone in the Introduction to his <i>Brant</i> (i. p. xvi.). In a note Col. Stone spoke of the document
as "long believed and recently revived and included in several works of authentic history." There are copies
of the original fabrication in the Stevens Collection of Frankliniana (Dept. of State at Washington; Stevens's
<i>Hist. Coll.</i>, i. p. 168); and in the Boston Public Library (<i>Franklin Collection</i>, p. 12).</p>

<p class="pc1">FROM THE TREATY OF PEACE WITH FRANCE, 1763, TO THE
TREATY OF PEACE WITH ENGLAND, 1783.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">BY WILLIAM FREDERICK POOLE, LL.D.<br />
<i>Librarian of the Newberry Library, Chicago.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE treaty of peace signed at Paris, February 10, 1763, marks perhaps
the most important epoch in the political and social history of North
America.<a name="FNanchor_1422_1422" id="FNanchor_1422_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a> It settled forever a question which had been in doubt for a
century,&mdash;whether the rule and civilization of France or of Great Britain
were to shape the destinies of the western continent. It was the culmination
of a seven years' war, in which the vigorous administration of William
Pitt had crushed the allied forces of France and Spain. The capture of
Quebec by Wolfe, and the surrender of the French army to Amherst at
Montreal, were but incidents in the general humiliation which France and
Spain had experienced on the continent of Europe, in India, in the West
Indies, and on the ocean. They could fight no longer, and were glad to
accept any terms of peace which Great Britain might dictate.<a name="FNanchor_1423_1423" id="FNanchor_1423_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a></p>

<p>The Treaty of Paris made a strange transformation of the political map
of North America, and for the first time brought under British sway the
territory which now comprises the Western States of the American Union.
Great Britain in the preceding century had granted in the charters of her
American colonies boundaries extending from ocean to ocean; but her
actual possessions until 1763 were a fringe of country along the Atlantic
coast, and extending west to the crests of the Alleghanies. Spain was in
possession of Florida and Mexico, and the remainder of the continent
was in the real or nominal possession of France. Her imperial domain
extended from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, and from the Alleghanies
to undetermined limits beyond the Rocky Mountains. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
Treaty of Paris, Canada and that portion of Louisiana between the Alleghanies
and the Mississippi came to Great Britain. In a secret treaty with
his Bourbon ally, Carlos III. of Spain, made November 3, 1762, the day
when the preliminary articles of peace were signed,<a name="FNanchor_1424_1424" id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> Louis XV. ceded to
Spain that part of Louisiana which lay west of the Mississippi, with the
island on which New Orleans is situated. France therefore, in this desperate
crisis, parted with all her American possessions on the main land,
and her name nearly disappeared from the map of North America.<a name="FNanchor_1425_1425" id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a> Spain
in the war had lost Havana, and in order to recover this key to her other
West India possessions she gave up to Great Britain Florida in exchange
for Havana.</p>

<p>Severer terms than these would have been exacted by Great Britain
from both the allies, except for the recent accession of George III. to the
throne, and the changes he made in his cabinet and policy. In the midst
of the negotiations of the treaty, Pitt resigned in disgust, and they were
concluded by his successor, the Earl of Bute, and by the Duke of Bedford.
The transfers of the immense territories ceded by the treaty were not immediate,
and several years elapsed before they came into possession of their
new rulers.</p>

<p>In the discussions by the new cabinet as to the terms of the treaty, a
question arose which was alarming to the American colonies. Should
Canada or the Island of Guadaloupe be restored to France? The sugar
trade of the latter, it was claimed, was more important to Great Britain
than the Canadian for trade. It was further claimed that, if the colonies
were relieved from the menace of the French and their savage allies, they
would cover the continent, become a great nation, manufacture their own
goods, and eventually declare themselves independent.<a name="FNanchor_1426_1426" id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a> Many pamphlets
appeared in England advocating and opposing the restoration of Canada to
France, but there was no abler advocate of the retention of Canada than
Dr. Franklin, who was then in London.<a name="FNanchor_1427_1427" id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 7th of October, 1763, George III. issued a proclamation,<a name="FNanchor_1428_1428" id="FNanchor_1428_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a> providing
for four new governments or colonies, namely: Quebec, East Florida,
West Florida, and Grenada, and defining their boundaries. The limits
of Quebec did not vary materially from those of the present province of
that name, and those of East and West Florida comprised the present
State of Florida and the country north of the Gulf of Mexico to the parallel
of 31° latitude.</p>

<p>It will be seen that no provision was made for the government of nine
tenths of the new territory acquired by the Treaty of Paris, and the
omission was not an oversight, but was intentional. The purpose was to
reserve as crown lands the Northwest territory, the region north of the
great lakes, and the country between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi,
and to exclude them from settlement by the American colonies. They
were left, for the time being, to the undisputed possession of the savage
tribes.<a name="FNanchor_1429_1429" id="FNanchor_1429_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a> The king's "loving subjects" were forbidden making purchases
of land from the Indians, or forming any settlements "westward of the
sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the West and Northwest",
"and all persons who have wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves
upon any lands" west of this limit were warned "forthwith to remove
themselves from such settlements." Certain reasons for this policy were
assigned in the proclamation, such as "preventing irregularities in the
future, and that the Indians may be convinced of our justice", etc.; but
the real explanation appears in the Report of the Lords Commissioners for
Trade and Plantations, in 1772, on the petition of Thomas Walpole and
others for a grant of land on the Ohio. The report was drawn by Lord
Hillsborough, the president of the board. The report states:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">"We take leave to remind your Lordships of that principle which was adopted by this
Board, and approved and confirmed by his Majesty, immediately after the Treaty of Paris,
viz.: the confining the western extent of settlements to such a distance from the seacoast
as that those settlements should lie within reach of the trade and commerce of this
kingdom, ... and also of the exercise of that authority and jurisdiction which was conceived
to be necessary for the preservation of the Colonies in a due subordination to, and
dependence upon, the mother country. And these we apprehend to have been the two
capital objects of his Majesty's proclamation of the 7th of October, 1763.... The great
object of colonizing upon the continent of North America has been to improve and extend
the commerce, navigation, and manufactures of this kingdom.... It does appear to us
that the extension of the fur trade depends entirely upon the Indians being undisturbed
in the possession of their hunting-grounds, and that all colonizing does in its nature, and
must in its consequences, operate to the prejudice of that branch of commerce.... Let
the savages enjoy their deserts in quiet. Were they driven from their forests the peltry-trade
would decrease; and it is not impossible that worse savages would take refuge in
them."<a name="FNanchor_1430_1430" id="FNanchor_1430_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Such in clear and specific terms was the cold and selfish policy which
the British crown and its ministers habitually pursued towards the American
colonies; and in a few years it changed loyalty into hate, and brought
on the American Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_1431_1431" id="FNanchor_1431_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Before the royal proclamation of 1763 had been issued, or even drafted,
a new and fierce Indian war, which is known in history as the Pontiac War,
was raging on the frontier settlements. With the conquest of Canada and
the expulsion of France as a military power from the continent, the English
colonists were abounding in loyalty to the mother country, were exultant
in the expectation of peace, and in the assurance of immunity from
Indian wars in the future; for it did not seem possible that, with the loose
system of organization and government common to the Indians, they could
plan and execute a general campaign without the co-operation of the French
as leaders.</p>

<p>This feeling of security among the English settlements was of short
duration. A general discontent pervaded all the Indian tribes from the
frontier settlements to the Mississippi, and from the great lakes to the
Gulf of Mexico. The extent of this disquietude was not suspected, and
hence no attempt was made to gain the good-will of the Indians. There
were many real causes for this discontent. The French had been politic
and sagacious in their intercourse with the Indian. They gained his friendship
by treating him with respect and justice. They came to him with
presents, and, as a rule, dealt with him fairly in trade. They came with
missionaries, unarmed, heroic, self-denying men, who labored without pay
for what they deemed the highest welfare of their dusky brethren. Many
Frenchmen married Indian wives, dwelt with the native tribes, and adopted
their customs. To the average Englishman, on the other hand, Indians
were disgusting objects; he would show them no respect, nor treat them
with justice except under compulsion. To him the only good Indians were
dead Indians, and hence he shot savages as he would wild beasts.<a name="FNanchor_1432_1432" id="FNanchor_1432_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a> So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>
long as the English had the French as competitors for the good-will of
the Indian, they treated him with some measure of tact and justice; but
when this competition was withdrawn, it was a sad day for both races.
The fur trade, by which the Indians obtained their necessary supplies, had
been mainly in the hands of the French; and when it was cut off, the Northern
and Western Indians, as they had lost the use of bows and arrows, and
needed firearms and ammunition in order to take their game, were often
in distress for want of food. When the military posts in the West were
in possession of the French, the Indians were habitual visitors, and they
loitered about the forts. The French tolerated the custom, and treated the
intruders with kindness, although their indolent and filthy habits greatly
taxed the patience of the garrisons. When these posts came into possession
of the English, the visitors were insulted and driven away, and they were
fortunate if they were not clubbed.<a name="FNanchor_1433_1433" id="FNanchor_1433_1433"></a><a href="#Footnote_1433_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a></p>

<p>The French had shown little disposition to make permanent settlements;
but the English, when they appeared, came to stay, and they occupied large
tracts of the best land for agricultural purposes. The French hunters and
traders, who were widely dispersed among the native tribes, kept the Indians
in a state of disquietude by misrepresenting the English, exaggerating their
faults, and making the prediction that the French would soon recapture
Canada and expel the English from the Western territories.</p>

<p>Pontiac, the chief of the Ottawas, was the Indian who had the motive,
the ambition, and capacity for organization which enabled him to concentrate
and use all these elements of discontent for his own malignant and
selfish purposes. After the defeat of the French, he professed for a time
to be friendly with the English, expecting that, under the acknowledged
supremacy of Great Britain, he would be recognized as a mighty Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span>
prince, and be assigned to rule over his own, and perhaps a confederacy of
other tribes.<a name="FNanchor_1434_1434" id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> Finding that the English government had no use for him, he
was indignant, and he devoted all the energies of his vigorous mind to a
secret conspiracy of uniting the tribes west of the Alleghanies to engage in
a general war against the English settlements. In the autumn of 1762 he
sent messengers with war-belts to the tribes living north of the great lakes,
to those in the Ohio and Illinois countries, and they went as far south as
the mouth of the Mississippi. His scheme was to make a simultaneous
attack on all the Western posts in the month of May, 1763; and each attack
was assigned to the neighboring tribes. His summer home was on a small
island at the entrance of Lake St. Clair; and being near Detroit, he was to
conduct in person the capture of that fort.<a name="FNanchor_1435_1435" id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a></p>

<p>On the 6th of May, 1763, Major Gladwin,<a name="FNanchor_1436_1436" id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> in command at Detroit, had
warning from an Indian girl that the next day an attempt would be made
to capture the fort by treachery. When Pontiac, on the appointed morning,
accompanied by sixty of his chiefs, with short guns concealed under
their blankets, appeared at the fort, and, as usual, asked for admission, he
was startled at seeing the whole garrison under arms, and that his scheme
of treachery had miscarried. For two months the savages assailed the fort,
and the sleepless garrison gallantly defended it, when they were relieved
by the arrival of a schooner from Fort Niagara, with sixty men, provisions,
and ammunition.</p>

<p>Fort Pitt, on the present site of Pittsburg, Pa.,<a name="FNanchor_1437_1437" id="FNanchor_1437_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a> was in command of Captain
Ecuyer, another trained soldier, who had been warned of the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>
conspiracy by Major Gladwin in a letter written May 5th. Captain Ecuyer,
having a garrison of three hundred and thirty soldiers and backwoodsmen,
immediately made every preparation for defence. On May 27th, a party of
Indians appeared at the fort under the pretence of wishing to trade, and
were treated as spies. Active operations against Fort Pitt were postponed
until the smaller forts had been taken.</p>

<p>Fort Sandusky was captured May 16th; Fort St. Joseph (on the St. Joseph
River, Mich.), May 25th; Fort Ouatanon (now Lafayette, Ind.), May 31st;
Fort Michillimackinac (now Mackinaw, Mich.), June 2d; Fort Presqu' Isle
(now Erie, Pa.), June 17th; Fort Le Bœuf (Erie County, Pa.), June 18th;
Fort Venango (Venango County, Pa.), June 18th; and the posts at Carlisle
and Bedford, Pa., on the same day. No garrison except that at Presqu' Isle
had warning of danger. The same method of capture was adopted in each
instance. A small party of Indians came to the fort with the pretence of
friendship, and were admitted. Others soon joined them, when the visitors
rose upon the small garrisons, butchered them, or took them captive. At
Presqu' Isle the Indians laid siege to the fort for two days, when they set it
on fire. At Venango no one of the garrison survived to give an account of
the capture.<a name="FNanchor_1438_1438" id="FNanchor_1438_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a></p>

<p>On June 22d, a large body of Indians surrounded Fort Pitt and opened
fire on all sides, but were easily repulsed. The next day they informed
Captain Ecuyer<a name="FNanchor_1439_1439" id="FNanchor_1439_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a> that every other English fort had been taken, and that all
the tribes were coming to take Fort Pitt. If he and his garrison would
then leave, they would assure him a safe conduct to the English settlements;
but otherwise they would be unable to protect him from the bad
Indians who would soon arrive. The commander thanked them for their
kind solicitude in his behalf, and informed them that he had plenty of men,
provisions, and ammunition, and could hold the fort against all the Indians
in the woods. He told them also that an army of six thousand English
would soon arrive at Fort Pitt, and that another army of three thousand
had gone up the lakes to punish the Ottawas and Ojibwas. "Therefore",
he said, "take pity on your women and children, and get out of the way
as soon as possible." The Indians departed the next day, and did not reappear
until July 26th, when they repeated their old story of "love for the
English", and grieved that "the chain of friendship had been broken." The
following night they surrounded the fort, and with knives dug burrows in
the river banks, from which they threw fire-arrows into the fort and shot
bullets whenever they had sight of a soldier above the parapets. This
sort of warfare was more dangerous to the besiegers than to the besieged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
During five days and nights of ceaseless attack the losses of the Indians
were more than twenty killed and wounded. In the garrison seven were
slightly wounded, and none killed. The Indians then disappeared in order
to intercept the expedition of Colonel Bouquet, which was approaching from
the east with a convoy of provisions for the relief of Fort Pitt.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for the country that there was an officer stationed at
Philadelphia who fully understood the meaning of the alarming reports
which were coming in from the Western posts. Colonel Henry Bouquet
was a gallant Swiss officer who had been trained in war from his youth, and
whose personal accomplishments gave an additional charm to his bravery
and heroic energy. He had served seven years in fighting American Indians,
and was more cunning than they in the practice of their own artifices.<a name="FNanchor_1440_1440" id="FNanchor_1440_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a>

<p>The promptness and energy with which this duty was performed,
under the most embarrassing conditions, make the expedition one of the
most brilliant episodes in American warfare. The only troops available for
the service were about five hundred regulars recently arrived from the siege
of Havana, broken in health, and many of them better fitted for the hospital
than the field.<a name="FNanchor_1442_1442" id="FNanchor_1442_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a> Orders for collecting supplies and means of transportation

nothing had been done towards their execution. Such, however, was his
energy and sagacity that in eighteen days the horses, oxen, wagons, and
provisions needed had been collected, and he was ready to march. As the
long train moved out of Carlisle towards the west, where lay the bleaching
bones of Braddock's army, the inhabitants looked on in anxious silence.
The sight of sixty invalid soldiers conveyed in wagons did not add to the
cheerfulness of the scene. Bouquet's most efficient soldiers were the 42d
regiment of Highlanders, whom he used as flankers.<a name="FNanchor_1443_1443" id="FNanchor_1443_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a></p>

<p>On the 25th of July he reached Fort Bedford, where he left his invalids
to recuperate, and engaged thirty backwoodsmen as guides. All communication
with Fort Pitt, one hundred and five miles distant, was cut off, and
the woods were filled with prowling savages. On August 2d he reached
Fort Ligonier, fifty miles from Bedford, where he left his draught-oxen and
wagons, and went on with three hundred and fifty pack-horses. About a
day's march further west lay the defiles of Turtle Creek, where he expected
the Indians would lay an ambuscade. He therefore determined to
proceed as far as a small stream called Bushy Run, rest till night, and pass
Turtle Creek under cover of darkness. At one o'clock in the afternoon of
August 5th, when the train was half a mile from Bushy Run, a report of
rifles was heard at the front, indicating that the advanced guard was engaged.
Two companies were ordered forward to support it. The woods
were quickly cleared, when firing was heard in the rear, and the troops
were ordered back to protect the baggage train. Forming a circle around
the convoy, the troops kept up the fight gallantly until night. As they
were exposed in the open field, while the Indians were under cover in the
woods, their loss was heavy compared with that of the enemy. Several
officers and about sixty soldiers were killed or wounded, and the situation
had become desperate. They had no choice but to camp on the hill where
the engagement had taken place, and without a drop of water. Sentinels
and outposts were stationed to guard against a night attack, and the morrow
was awaited with anxious solicitude. During the night Colonel Bouquet
wrote to General Amherst: "Whatever our fate may be, I thought it
necessary to give your excellency this information.... I fear insurmountable
difficulties in protecting and transporting our provisions, being already
so much weakened by the losses of this day in men and horses."</p>

<p>With the early morning light the woods rang with the exultant war-cries
of the Indians. The battle was renewed, and the savages, seeing the distress
of the troops, pressed closer and closer, expecting an easy victory.
Colonel Bouquet, with a quick perception of the situation and full knowledge
of the Indian character, saw that his only hope of escaping the fate
of Braddock's army was to draw the enemy from their cover and bring
them into close engagement with his regulars. This he did by a stratagem.
He ordered his most advanced troops, when in action, to fall back suddenly,
as if in retreat, behind a second line lying in ambush. The Indians he expected
would follow, eager to seize the train.</p>

<p>The line in ambush would
then open fire, and in the surprise and confusion of the savages the remaining
troops would charge upon them. The stratagem was a complete success.
As the advanced line retreated, the Indians rushed out of the woods,
supposing they were victors. When the line in ambush had delivered its
fire and stopped the progress of the Indians, the retreating line had changed
direction and were ready to make a charge upon the flank. The ambuscading
line then rose and fell upon the enemy in front, who fled, leaving
sixty of their number on the field, and among them several prominent chiefs.
The pursuit was continued, and the victory was complete.<a name="FNanchor_1444_1444" id="FNanchor_1444_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> The next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span>
the expedition, carrying their wounded on litters, moved on towards Fort
Pitt, twenty-five miles distant, and arriving four days after the fight, to the
great joy of the beleaguered garrison.</p>

<p>The battle of Bushy Run, both for its military conduct and its political
results, deserves a place among the memorable battles in America. The
Indians fought with a courage and desperation rarely seen in Indian warfare,
and the English troops with a steadiness and valor which was due to
their training as regulars and the direction of so able a commander. The
tidings of this victory broke the spirit of the Indian conspiracy, and the
reports were received with rejoicing in all the English colonies.<a name="FNanchor_1445_1445" id="FNanchor_1445_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a></p>

<p>The ultimate purpose of Colonel Bouquet's expedition, after relieving
Fort Pitt, was to invade the Ohio country, punish the Shawanese, Delawares,
and other tribes, extort from them treaties of peace, and recover the
English captives in their possession. On account of his losses of men,
horses, and supplies at Bushy Run, he was unable to carry out this design
until he was reinforced, and it was now too late in the season to expect that
his wants could be supplied from the East. His Ohio expedition was therefore
postponed until the next year.</p>

<p class="p2">On the 29th of July Detroit was reinforced by two hundred and eighty
men under Captain Dalzell, who in June had left Fort Niagara in twenty-two
barges, with several cannon and a supply of provisions and ammunition.
The day after his arrival, Captain Dalzell proposed, with two hundred
and fifty men, to make a night attack on Pontiac's camp and capture
him. Major Gladwin discouraged the attempt, but finally, against his
judgment, consented. Some Canadians obtained the secret and carried it
to Pontiac, who waylaid the party in an ambuscade. Twenty of the English
were killed and thirty-nine wounded. Among the killed was Captain
Dalzell himself.<a name="FNanchor_1446_1446" id="FNanchor_1446_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a> Pontiac could make no use of this success, as the fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span>
was strongly garrisoned and well supplied with provisions and ammunition.
Elsewhere there was nothing to encourage him. The battle of Bushy Run
and the arrival of Colonel Bouquet at Fort Pitt alarmed the Western tribes
and ruptured the Pontiac confederation. In October some of the chiefs
who beleaguered the fort at Detroit sued for peace, and in November the
siege was raised. All hope of capturing Fort Pitt had vanished, and the
warriors returned to their hunting-grounds. There was quietness on the
frontiers during the winter of 1763-64.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1764 scattered war parties were again ravaging the borders.
Colonel Bouquet was recruiting in Pennsylvania, and preparing an
outfit for his march into the valley of the Ohio. In June, Colonel Bradstreet,
with a force of twelve hundred men, was sent up the great lakes.
On arriving at Fort Niagara he found assembled a large body of Indians
whom Sir William Johnson had summoned into council, using threats when
they did not readily respond to his summons. It was apparent that the
haughty spirit of the tribes was broken. Treaties of peace were concluded,
and a strip of land between the lakes Erie and Ontario, four miles wide on
each side of the river Niagara, was ceded to the British government.<a name="FNanchor_1447_1447" id="FNanchor_1447_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a></p>

<p>Bradstreet proceeded up Lake Erie, and near Presqu' Isle made, on his
own authority, an absurd treaty of peace with some alleged deputies of the
Ohio Indians who had made the Western settlements so much trouble; and
he added to his folly by writing to his superior officer, Colonel Bouquet,
that the Colonel need not march into the Ohio country, as the business
of pacifying the Western Indians had been attended to. Bradstreet went
on to Sandusky; and instead of punishing the Wyandots, Ottawas, and
Miamis, as he was instructed to do, accepted their promise to follow him
to Detroit and there make treaties. He arrived in Detroit on the 26th
of August. Pontiac had departed, and sent messages of defiance from the
banks of the Maumee.<a name="FNanchor_1448_1448" id="FNanchor_1448_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a></p>

<p>Colonel Bouquet met with every obstacle in raising troops and collecting
supplies for his Ohio expedition, from the stubborn Quakers in the Assembly
of Pennsylvania. It was not until September 17th that his convoy
arrived at Fort Pitt. Early in October he marched with fifteen hundred
men and a long train of pack-horses into the valley of the Muskingum.
Wherever he appeared with his strong force the Indian tribes were ready,
after much talk, to make treaties of peace and deliver up their white captives,
two hundred of whom, and some with reluctance, were taken back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
the settlements.<a name="FNanchor_1449_1449" id="FNanchor_1449_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a> Colonel Bouquet marched to the forks of the Muskingum,<a name="FNanchor_1450_1450" id="FNanchor_1450_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a>
meeting with no opposition, and, having accomplished his purposes,
retraced his march, and arrived at Fort Pitt on the 28th of November.
The success of the expedition and the return of the captives to their homes
were the occasion of joy through the whole country. The assemblies of
Pennsylvania and Virginia passed votes of thanks to Colonel Bouquet, and
the king conferred on him the rank of brigadier-general. Early in the summer
of 1765 he was put in command of the Southern district, and died of
fever at Pensacola, September 2, ten days after his arrival.<a name="FNanchor_1451_1451" id="FNanchor_1451_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a> Had he lived

<p>The Pontiac War, so far as battles and campaigns were concerned, was
ended; but Pontiac was still at large and as untamed as ever. His last hope
was the Illinois country, where the foot of an English soldier had never
trod. Thither he went, and applying to M. Neyon, in command of Fort
Chartres, for aid, was refused. He returned to his camp on the Maumee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span>
and collecting four hundred of his own warriors, and as many of other tribes
as would join him, reappeared at Fort Chartres. M. Neyon had left the
country in disgust, with many French residents of the Illinois country, and
M. Saint Ange de Bellerive was his successor in command of the fort. His
visitors, with a mob of Illinois Indians, clamored for weapons and ammunition
to fight the English. St. Ange's position was embarrassing, if not
dangerous; but he acted with prudence and sagacity. He was under orders
to deliver up the fort whenever a British force arrived. He refused to comply
with the demands of the Indians, but pacified them with pleasant words
and a few presents. The most agreeable sight to this worthy Frenchman,
at that time, would have been the arrival of a regiment of British infantry.</p>

<p>Pontiac, again baffled, sent an embassy of warriors down the Mississippi,
with an immense war-belt, and with instructions to show it at every Indian
village on the river, and to procure from the French commandant at New
Orleans the aid he could not get at Fort Chartres. The warriors reached
New Orleans soon after the distressing news had come that Western Louisiana
had been ceded to Spain by the secret treaty of November 3, 1762.
The health of the governor, D'Abbadie, had given way under the intelligence
that a Spanish governor and garrison might arrive any day. The
governor gave the Indians one hearing, and postponed the interview until
the next day. Before the hour named had arrived he was dead.<a name="FNanchor_1453_1453" id="FNanchor_1453_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> M. Aubry,
his successor, received the warriors, and said he could do nothing for
them. Sullen and disappointed, they paddled their canoes northward, and
the last hope of the conspiracy expired.<a name="FNanchor_1454_1454" id="FNanchor_1454_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a></p>

<p>An attempt was made early in 1764 to take possession of the Illinois
country by sending English troops up the Mississippi River. Major Arthur
Loftus, with four hundred regulars, ascended two hundred and forty miles
above New Orleans, where Indians in ambuscade fired on them, killed six
men, and wounded six others.<a name="FNanchor_1455_1455" id="FNanchor_1455_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> The expedition turned back, and returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[702]</a></span>
to Pensacola. Captain Philip Pittman<a name="FNanchor_1456_1456" id="FNanchor_1456_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a> arrived at New Orleans a few months
later with the same design, and ascertaining the temper of the Western
Indians, did not make the attempt.<a name="FNanchor_1457_1457" id="FNanchor_1457_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a></p>

<p>General Gage, who in November, 1763, succeeded General Amherst as
commander-in-chief, saw that there would be no permanent peace with the
Western Indians until Fort Chartres and the Illinois country were occupied
by British troops, and he resolved to send a force by way of Fort
Pitt and the Ohio River. Before executing the plan he thought it advisable
to send a messenger in advance, who would visit the tribes, ascertain
their dispositions, and allay their enmities if he could not secure their
friendship. George Croghan was the person selected for this responsible
and dangerous mission. He was deputy-superintendent of Indian affairs
under Sir William Johnson. As a fur-trader he had been on friendly relations
with the Western tribes, and spoke their language. Lieutenant
Alexander Fraser, who spoke French, was to accompany him. They
arrived at Fort Pitt in February, 1765, where Croghan was delayed for
three months, holding councils with Indians.<a name="FNanchor_1458_1458" id="FNanchor_1458_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a></p>

<p>Croghan left Fort Pitt on the 14th of May, in two bateaux, with a few
soldiers and fourteen<a name="FNanchor_1459_1459" id="FNanchor_1459_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a> Indian deputies, Shawanese, Mingos, and Delawares,
as evidence and pledge that there was peace between the English and
the Western tribes.</p>

with its gate in cut stone, furnished with two

</div></div>

<p>On the 23d he arrived at the mouth of the Scioto,
where the Shawanese delivered to him seven French traders. On the
6th of June he came to the mouth of the Wabash, where there were indications
of the presence of hostile Indians. He dropped down the Ohio
six miles further and encamped. On the morning of the 8th his party was
fired into by eighty Kickapoos and Mascoutins, and two white men and
three of the Shawanese deputies were killed. Croghan himself, and all the
rest of the party except two white men and one Indian, were wounded.
They were robbed of their outfit, and carried as prisoners to Vincennes.<a name="FNanchor_1460_1460" id="FNanchor_1460_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a>
Here Croghan found Indian acquaintances and friends who treated him and
his party with kindness, and rebuked their assailants.<a name="FNanchor_1461_1461" id="FNanchor_1461_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a> At Post Ouatanon<a name="FNanchor_1462_1462" id="FNanchor_1462_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span>
Croghan found more of his Indian acquaintances; and his captivity being
ended, he resumed his official character of ambassador, received deputations
from the neighboring tribes, held councils, heard and made speeches,
and smoked the pipe of peace. He here received a message from St. Ange,
requesting him to visit Fort Chartres, and arrange matters there, which had
become exceedingly annoying. He started for the Illinois country on the
18th of July, accompanied by the chiefs of the neighboring tribes. He
soon met Pontiac and the deputies from the Illinois tribes on their way to
visit him. Both parties returned to the fort and held a council. Pontiac
and the Illinois tribes agreed to make peace with the English, as the other
nations had done.<a name="FNanchor_1463_1463" id="FNanchor_1463_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[705]</a></span></p>

<p>The object of his visit being accomplished, Croghan turned his face
homeward, and reached Detroit on the 17th of August. Here he called
the Ottawas and the other neighboring tribes into a council, which continued
for several days. The Indians acknowledged that they now saw
that the French were indeed conquered; that henceforth they would listen
no more to the whistling of evil birds, but would lay down the hatchet, and
sit quiet on their mats. Pontiac was present, and said: "Father, I declare
to all nations that I had made my peace with you before I came here; and
I now deliver my pipe to Sir William Johnson, that he may know that I
have made peace, and taken the King of England to be my father in the
presence of all the nations now assembled."<a name="FNanchor_1464_1464" id="FNanchor_1464_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a></p>

<p>From Detroit, Croghan communicated to the commander at Fort Pitt
tidings of the complete success of his Western mission; and a company
of the 42d regiment of Highlanders, the veterans of Quebec, Ticonderoga,
and Bushy Run, under the command of Captain Thomas Stirling, was dispatched
in boats for Fort Chartres. Captain Stirling arrived early in October,<a name="FNanchor_1465_1465" id="FNanchor_1465_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a>
and on the 10th relieved St. Ange from his embarrassing command.<a name="FNanchor_1466_1466" id="FNanchor_1466_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[706]</a></span></p>

<p>Croghan left Detroit on the 26th of November, visited Fort Niagara, and
arrived at Fort Stanwix, October 21, where he prepared his report to Sir
William Johnson, which Sir William transmitted to the Lords of Trade,
November 16, 1765.<a name="FNanchor_1468_1468" id="FNanchor_1468_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a></p>

<p>For the next decade, the discreet management of the native tribes by Sir
William Johnson secured the Western settlements from Indian depredations.
During this period there was a constant emigration from Maryland,
Virginia, and Pennsylvania into the country between the mountains and
the Ohio River, and explorations were begun in Kentucky. The treaty
of Fort Stanwix, made with the Six Nations and their dependants in the
autumn of 1768, transferred to the British crown the Indian title to what
is now the State of Kentucky east of the Tennessee (then Cherokee)
River, and a large part of Western Virginia. To the province of Pennsylvania
it ceded an extensive tract on its western borders, and defined the
boundaries between the English settlements and the Indian territory.<a name="FNanchor_1469_1469" id="FNanchor_1469_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> In
making this important treaty, Sir William was acting under instructions
from the crown, and was furnished with a map<a name="FNanchor_1470_1470" id="FNanchor_1470_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> indicating the boundaries
desired, for which concessions the crown would give money and presents.
He summoned the deputies of the Six Nations and their dependent tribes
to meet him in council at Fort Stanwix (now Rome, N. Y.), on the 20th of
September, 1768. By the 22d, 2,200 Indians had arrived,<a name="FNanchor_1471_1471" id="FNanchor_1471_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a> and when the

<p>Open hostilities between the Indians and settlers on the Western frontier,
which had been suspended since 1765, broke out anew in the spring of
1774,<a name="FNanchor_1475_1475" id="FNanchor_1475_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a> and raged for a few months in what has been called "Cresap's War",<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[708]</a></span>
but is now more properly known as the "Dunmore War." Lord Dunmore
was then governor of Virginia, and commander of the English forces engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span>
in the brief campaign. As to the specific cause of the Dunmore War
there has been much controversy. The killing of Logan's family, wrongly
charged upon Captain Michael Cresap, was one of the causes assigned.
Another was the conduct of Dr. John Connolly, the agent of Lord Dunmore
in West Virginia, who was charged with being concerned in a plot to
bring on a conflict between the settlers and the Indians, in order to serve
British interests in the Revolutionary War which was then coming on.<a name="FNanchor_1476_1476" id="FNanchor_1476_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a>
Lord Dunmore was suspected at the time of being in the plot,<a name="FNanchor_1477_1477" id="FNanchor_1477_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a> and the
charge was probably as groundless as that made against Captain Cresap.
The occasion of the outbreak lay upon the surface of events,&mdash;the growing
disquietude and jealousy of the Indians in view of the advancing settlements
of the whites, which had reached the eastern bank of the Ohio and
was moving farther west. The Shawanese and Delawares had been robbing
traders and scalping settlers, whenever an opportunity occurred, ever
since they had made a treaty of peace with Colonel Bouquet in 1764. Sir
William Johnson's letters to the home government during these nine years
are full of narratives of these outrages, and forebodings that another Indian
war might break out at any time. More white persons were killed by
these Indians during this period of nominal peace than in the whole campaign
of the Dunmore War.</p>

<p>A bitter controversy between Virginia and Pennsylvania for possession
of the country between the mountains and the Ohio added to the complications
arising from the Indian troubles.<a name="FNanchor_1478_1478" id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a> Virginia held Fort Pitt and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[710]</a></span>
in possession of the country. In 1774 the tide of emigration was setting
strongly towards Kentucky, which had been explored by Daniel Boone in
1769, and later by other parties.<a name="FNanchor_1479_1479" id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> In April, a party of eighty or ninety Virginians
made a rendezvous at the mouth of the Little Kanawha, with the
intention of descending the Ohio and making a settlement in Kentucky.
George Rogers Clark, whose name is to appear later in more important
transactions, then twenty-one years of age, was one of the party. In a letter,<a name="FNanchor_1480_1480" id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a>
written some years later, to Dr. Samuel Brown, professor in Transylvania
University, he gives a clear account of the manner in which the Dunmore
War began. While camping at the rendezvous, "reports", says Clark,
"from the Indian towns were alarming, which caused many to decline meeting.
A small party of hunters below us had been fired on by the Indians,
which led us to believe that the Indians were determined to make war."
They resolved to surprise an Indian town on the Scioto, but had no competent
leader. "We knew of Captain Cresap being on the river, about fifteen
miles above us, with some hands, settling a plantation, and intending to follow
us to Kentucky as soon as he had fixed his people. We also knew he
had experience in a former war.<a name="FNanchor_1481_1481" id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a> It was proposed, and unanimously agreed
on, to send for him to command the party." The messenger met Cresap
on his way to Clark's camp. "A council was called, and to our astonishment
our intended general was the person who dissuaded us from the enterprise,
alleging that appearances were suspicious, but there was no certainty
of a war; that if we made the attempt proposed, he had no doubt of success,
but that a war would be the result, and that we should be blamed for
it, and perhaps justly. He was asked what measure he would recommend
to us. His answer was that we should return to Wheeling to obtain intelligence
of what was going forward; that a few weeks would determine the
matter; and if we should find the Indians not hostilely disposed, we should
have full time to prosecute the intended settlements in Kentucky. This
measure was adopted, and in two hours we were under weigh."</p>

<p>On arriving at Wheeling, the people, being in a state of alarm, flocked
into their camp from every direction. All the hunters and men without
families joined them, and they became a formidable party. From Pittsburg
they received a message from Dr. Connolly requesting them to keep their
position until the messengers returned who had been sent to the Indian
towns. Before an answer could be received, a second message, addressed
to Captain Cresap, arrived by express from Pittsburg, stating that war was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span>
inevitable. Cresap was entreated to use his influence with the party to
cover the country until the inhabitants could fortify themselves. "The time
of the reception of this letter", says Clark, "was the epoch of open hostilities
with the Indians. The war-post was planted, a council called, the letter
read, the ceremonies used by the Indians on so important an occasion acted,
and war was formally declared. The same evening two scalps were brought
into camp. The following day some canoes of Indians were discovered descending
the river, taking advantage of an island to cover themselves from
our view. They were chased by our men fifteen miles down the river. They
were forced ashore, and a battle ensued. A few were wounded on both sides,
and we got one scalp only."</p>

<p>The more important charge brought against Cresap, of killing Logan's
family, George Rogers Clark disposed of in the same letter, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On our return to camp [from Grave Creek] a resolution was formed to
march next day and attack Logan's camp on the Ohio [at Baker's Bottom,
opposite the mouth of Yellow Creek], about thirty miles above Wheeling.
We actually marched about five miles, and halted to take refreshment. Here
the impropriety of executing the proposed enterprise was argued; the conversation
was brought on by Cresap himself. It was generally agreed that
those Indians had no hostile intentions, as it was a hunting party, composed
of men, women, and children, with all their stuff with them.... In short,
every person present, particularly Cresap, upon reflection, was opposed to
the projected measure. We returned, and on the same evening decamped
and took the road to Redstone. It was two days after this that Logan's
family was killed; and from the manner in which it was done, it was viewed
as a horrid murder by the whole country."</p>

<p>The killing of Logan's family was done by a party of whites living in
the vicinity, under the lead of one Greathouse, who was not a member of
the party of Cresap, nor, so far as appears, had he any acquaintance with
Cresap.<a name="FNanchor_1482_1482" id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a> The "Speech of Logan", which Jefferson printed in his <i>Notes on
Virginia</i> (1787, p. 105), and accompanied with the comment that Cresap
was "a man infamous for his many murders he had committed on these
injured people",<a name="FNanchor_1483_1483" id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a> has perpetuated an unmerited stigma upon the memory
of an innocent and patriotic man. The speech for a century has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[712]</a></span>
regarded as a choice specimen of Indian eloquence, and the youth of the
land have worn it threadbare as a declamation exercise.<a name="FNanchor_1484_1484" id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[713]</a></span></p>

<p>The savagery and miseries of a border war now burst upon the Western
frontier. The settlers left their homes and took refuge in the forts, and
many new stockades were constructed. Roving bands of Indians swept
over the country, pillaging the farms and murdering every white person
they found. The Virginia government took prompt action in raising two
armies to invade the Indian country. One assembled at Lewisburg, in
Greenbriar County, under General Andrew Lewis; and the other at Fort
Pitt, under Lord Dunmore. General Lewis had orders to march to the
mouth of the Great Kanawha; and Lord Dunmore, descending the Ohio,
promised to meet him there. Early in June, while these forces were collecting,
Colonel Angus McDonald, with four hundred men, dropped down
the Ohio from Wheeling, and landing at Grave Creek, marched against the
Indians on the Muskingum, and found their village deserted. The Indians,
expecting the whites would cross the river in pursuit, were prepared to
receive them in an ambuscade; but finding that the whites were now as
well skilled in woodcraft as they, came in and proposed terms of peace.
Five chiefs were required of them as hostages. One of these was liberated
under the promise that he would bring in the chiefs of other tribes to
make peace. A second was sent out to find the first, and neither returning,
Colonel McDonald burnt their town, destroyed the crops, and went
back to Wheeling with the three hostage chiefs, whom he sent to Williamsburg
as prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_1485_1485" id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a></p>

<p>General Lewis took up his march with eleven hundred men on the 11th
of September, and arriving at Point Pleasant, near the mouth of the Great
Kanawha, on the 6th of October, found that Lord Dunmore was not there.
On the 9th a despatch was received from his lordship, stating that he had
changed his plans, and should land at the mouth of the Big Hockhocking.
Lewis was ordered to cross the Ohio and meet him near the Indian towns.
The Indians had this information, doubtless, before it was received by General
Lewis, and resolved to attack his camp forthwith before a junction of
the two armies was made. The battle came on the next morning while
General Lewis was preparing to cross the river, and was fought with the
highest courage and skill on both sides until evening, when the Indians
were surprised by a flank movement which they supposed was a reinforcement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span>
They gave way and retreated across the river. The Indians were
commanded by the noted chief Cornstalk.<a name="FNanchor_1486_1486" id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a> The battle of Point Pleasant
ranks with Bushy Run as one of the most plucky and evenly contested
battles ever fought between Indians and white soldiers. The losses of the
Virginians were seventy-five killed and one hundred and forty wounded.
The losses of the Indians, who fought under cover, were probably about
the same, but were not ascertained, as they threw their dead into the
river.<a name="FNanchor_1487_1487" id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a></p>

<p>Reinforced by several companies under Colonel Christian, General Lewis
crossed the river, with the intention of joining Lord Dunmore near Chillicothe.
At Salt Licks (now Jackson, Ohio) he had orders to halt his troops.
Suspecting the motives of Lord Dunmore, he disregarded the orders and
pressed on. Near Chillicothe Dunmore made a treaty with the Ohio Indians,
who promised not to hunt south of the Ohio, and not to molest voyagers
on the river. Lord Dunmore's conduct in changing the plan of the
campaign, which left General Lewis exposed to a separate attack, and his
subsequent conduct in making peace with the Indians before he had punished
them for their breach of former treaties, were regarded by the soldiers
engaged as premeditated treachery. This impression was confirmed by
the plot he later made with Indians to ravage the settlements of Virginia,
and by his hasty departure from the colony. His real motives will never
be known. The initial scenes in the drama of the Revolutionary War were
in progress. His position as a Tory governor was embarrassing, and naturally
inspired suspicion in the minds of the colonists.<a name="FNanchor_1488_1488" id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a></p>

<p>While the Dunmore War was in progress, the "Quebec Bill" was discussed
and enacted by the British Parliament. The bill so enlarged the
boundaries of the province of Quebec that it made the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers its southern and western limits, and the whole Northwest territory
a part of Canada. The bill in its passage did not escape the protest
of Lord Chatham, Edmund Burke, Charles James Fox, Colonel Barré,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span>
and the corporation of the city of London.<a name="FNanchor_1489_1489" id="FNanchor_1489_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a> The colonies, at the time of
the enactment of the Quebec Bill, made complaint concerning it "for establishing
the Roman Catholic religion in the province of Quebec, abolishing
the equitable system of English laws, and erecting a tyranny there, to
the great danger (from so total a dissimilarity of religion, law, and government)
of the neighboring colonies."<a name="FNanchor_1490_1490" id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a> Its real purpose and effect, however,
of robbing the American colonies of 240,000 square miles of territory which
had already been ceded to them in their charters, and establishing the Mississippi
and the Ohio rivers as Canadian boundaries, in case of war and a
separation of the Eastern colonies from the mother country, were not mentioned,
and seem not to have been considered. The colonies then had
little interest in, and scarcely a thought of, the country beyond the Alleghanies.
During the war, however, they learned something of the value of the
West; and in the negotiations for peace, in 1782-3, the Quebec Bill was
often recurred to as one of the principal causes of the Revolution.<a name="FNanchor_1491_1491" id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a></p>

<p class="p2">For several years after the close of the Dunmore War the Western Indians
were again quiet. They heard with satisfaction of the opening battles
of the Revolution, and were not in haste to take the war-path for either
side. Except at the British post of Detroit, the sentiments of the settlers
west of the mountains were intensely anti-English. The Eastern colonies
were too much occupied in their own defence to give any attention to what
was happening at the West. The hardy pioneers, left to themselves, conducted
their own campaigns. They were not enrolled in the Continental
army, and they knew little of, and cared less for, the Continental Congress
and the great commander-in-chief of the army. They recognized only the
authority of Virginia; and, as voluntary and patriotic rangers, they achieved
some of the most important and brilliant victories of the war, concerning
which the official proceedings of Congress, and the voluminous correspondence
of Washington and of other prominent actors in the war, make
scarcely a mention.</p>

<p>The northeastern portion of Kentucky was explored by Dr. Walker in
1747, the central portion by Daniel Boone and others in 1769, and the
northwestern portion in 1773. The first log cabin in Kentucky was built
by James Harrod at Harrodsburg, Mercer County, in 1774, and the first
fort by Boone, at Boonesborough, Madison County, in June, 1775.<a name="FNanchor_1492_1492" id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a> About<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span>
this time George Rogers Clark made an exploring tour in Kentucky, and in
the autumn returned to his home in Albemarle County, Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_1493_1493" id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> In the
following spring he went back to Kentucky; and, in view of the depredations
which the Ohio Indians were committing on the settlements, called a
meeting of the pioneers at Harrodsburg to devise a plan of defence. His
plan was to appoint delegates who should proceed to Williamsburg and
petition the Assembly that Kentucky be made a county of Virginia. The
meeting, however, acting before his arrival and against his judgment,
elected him and Gabriel Jones to be members of the Virginia Assembly.
Their journey through the trackless wilderness and across the mountains
was attended with great suffering, and they arrived after the legislature
had adjourned. Patrick Henry was the governor. Before him and the
Council, Clark laid the claim of Kentuckians to be regarded as citizens of
Virginia, and asked for five hundred pounds of powder as a gift for their
protection. He was heard with attention and respect, but was told that
the Council had no authority to furnish the gunpowder as a gift. It could
be loaned to the Kentuckians as friends, but not as citizens. Clark refused
to accept it on such conditions, and left, saying, "A country which is not
worth defending is not worth claiming." He was called back, and an order
on the commandant at Fort Pitt was given to him for the powder. At the
autumn session of the legislature Kentucky was made a county of Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_1494_1494" id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a></p>

<p>On returning to Kentucky Clark found the country more disturbed than
ever. The Ohio Indians were invading it with larger parties; they lay in
ambush about every fort,<a name="FNanchor_1495_1495" id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> and murdered the luckless soldier of the garrison
who ventured outside the stockade. Clark seriously pondered over this
alarming state of affairs, and came to the conclusion that the strategic points
for defending Kentucky were on the north side of the Ohio River. He had
probably never heard of Scipio Africanus and of his policy of fighting
the enemy in the enemy's country. Without disclosing his thoughts to any
one, he sent, during the summer of 1777, two young hunters as spies to
Kaskaskia and Vincennes, and, having received favorable reports, started
in October<a name="FNanchor_1496_1496" id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a> for Williamsburg. There, on December 10th, he laid before
Governor Henry his plan for the conquest of the Northwest territory from
the British, whom he regarded as the instigators of the Indian raids upon
Kentucky. He also consulted confidentially with George Mason, George
Wythe, and Thomas Jefferson. They, with the governor, were enthusiastic
for the execution of his scheme and took immediate steps to furnish him
with ammunition and supplies.</p>

<p>The recent surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga
had inspired a new energy in the conduct of the war. The necessary
legislation was obtained under the pretext that the supplies were for the
defence of Kentucky. Twelve hundred pounds, in the depreciated currency
of Virginia, was voted him for expenses in the enemy's country. In
January, 1778, Clark received from Governor Henry the rank of colonel,
and two sets of instructions: one, which was public, for the defence of
Kentucky; and the other, which was secret, for an "attack on the British
post at Kaskaskia." He was empowered to raise seven companies, of
fifty men each, in any county of the commonwealth, to act as militia under
his orders.<a name="FNanchor_1497_1497" id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a> He began recruiting, under his public orders, at Fort Pitt, but
with little success, owing to quarrels between Virginia and Pennsylvania,
and the opposition to the policy of sending soldiers, who were needed there,
to defend Kentucky.<a name="FNanchor_1498_1498" id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a> After much tribulation he raised three companies,
and took them down the river to Corn Island, at the Falls of the Ohio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[718]</a></span>
opposite Louisville. Several companies that had been recruited elsewhere
were promised him, but they did not arrive. Some of his men deserted, but
enough Kentuckians joined him to make up four companies, or nearly two
hundred men.<a name="FNanchor_1499_1499" id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> Here he divulged the secret of their destination, and read
to the men his confidential instructions. They willingly accepted the situation,
and the next day the expedition started. As their boats shot the falls,
the sun was in total eclipse, which fixes the date as June 24, 1778. He had
just received from Fort Pitt the news of the treaty of alliance between
France and the United States, which he could use to advantage with the
French settlers at Kaskaskia. With two relays at the oars, he ran the
boats day and night, and on the 28th landed on an island at the mouth of
the Cherokee (Tennessee) River. Here a party of white hunters, who had
been at Kaskaskia eight days before, was brought in, and they volunteered
to accompany him. Nine miles below the island, and one mile above old
Fort Massac, they ran into a small creek, concealed their boats, and without
a cannon,<a name="FNanchor_1500_1500" id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a> a horse, or any means of transporting baggage or supplies,
took up their march of more than a hundred miles across the prairies.<a name="FNanchor_1501_1501" id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[719]</a></span></p>

<p>On the afternoon of July 4th they arrived within three miles of Kaskaskia,
the river of that name lying between them and the town. There they
remained concealed until dark, when they marched to a farm-house on the
east bank of the river, about a mile north of the town, captured boats,
crossed the river, and found that the people of the town, who a few days
before had been under arms expecting an attack, were not aware of their
approach. "I immediately", writes Clark, "divided my little army into
two divisions: ordered one to surround the town; with the other I broke
into the fort,<a name="FNanchor_1502_1502" id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a> secured the governor, Mr. Rocheblave, [and] in fifteen minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[720]</a></span>

people on pain of death to keep close to their houses, which they observed;
and before daylight had the whole town disarmed."<a name="FNanchor_1503_1503" id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a></p>

<p>Clark had been informed by the hunters who accompanied him that the
French residents of Kaskaskia regarded the Kentuckians, whom they called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[722]</a></span>
<i>Big-Knives</i>, as more savage than Indians; and resolving to make use of
this impression, he gave them a shock which would enable them later to
appreciate his lenity. The troops, therefore, kept up during the night the
most hideous noises; and the residents, believing they had indeed fallen
into the hands of savages, gave themselves up as lost. In the morning
Clark had for them another surprise. M. Gibault, the priest, with some
aged citizens, came to him and begged that the people might once more
assemble in their church, hold a service, and take leave of each other,
which request was readily granted. When the service was over a deputation
came and said the people would submit to the fate of war and the loss of
their property, but asked that they might not be separated from their wives
and children. "Do you mistake us for savages?" said Clark. "My countrymen
disdain to make war upon women and children. It was to prevent
the horrors of Indian butchery upon our wives and children that we have
taken up arms and appear in this stronghold of British and Indian barbarity.
Now please inform your fellow-citizens that they are at liberty to conduct
themselves as usual without the least apprehension." They were told of
the treaty of alliance with France, and that if he could have surety of their
attachment to the American cause they could enjoy all the privileges of its
government, and their property would be secure to them. The people were
transported with joy, and took the oath of allegiance to the State of Virginia.
They also raised a company of volunteers, who accompanied Major
Bowman to Cahokia, a French settlement sixty miles north of Kaskaskia.
That town readily gave its adhesion to the American cause. Clark also
put himself in friendly relations with the Spanish commandant at St. Louis.<a name="FNanchor_1504_1504" id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a></p>

<p>Clark next turned his attention to the British post of Vincennes.
M. Gibault, the friendly priest, in view of what had taken place at Kaskaskia
and Cahokia, thought that it was unnecessary to send troops to Vincennes.
The post was in his spiritual jurisdiction, and he offered to undertake the
mission himself, with several persons accompanying him. The result was
the same as at Cahokia. The few British soldiers at the post could make
no resistance to the popular sentiment, and withdrew to Detroit. Clark,
having no troops to spare, allowed the residents, after taking the oath, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>
garrison and to be responsible for the safety of the fort, which he put in
charge of one of his own officers, Captain Leonard Helm, who retained one
of his own privates. M. Gibault returned to Kaskaskia about the 1st of
August; and Clark, in less than one month after his arrival, was in possession
of every British post in the Illinois country, without a battle or the
loss of a life.<a name="FNanchor_1505_1505" id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a></p>

<p>A problem now demanded solution which was of so difficult a nature
that it would challenge the sagacity and resources of a veteran commander,
and Clark was not a veteran. He was twenty-five years of age, and his
only military experience had been as a ranger in Kentucky, and as a
captain in the short and bloodless campaign of Lord Dunmore. How was
he to hold this immense territory with less than two hundred three-months
militiamen, whose term of enlistment had already expired, and with no hope
of receiving recruits from Kentucky or Virginia? The British commander
could send down a force which would outnumber his ten to one. The
savage tribes which had ravaged Kentucky could by concerted action overwhelm
his scanty force. The Virginia currency which he brought to pay
for supplies he found would buy nothing in the Illinois country. It was
fortunate for the nation and the Western States that George Rogers Clark
was equal to the emergency, and that he had the self-reliance and sagacity
to solve the problem successfully.</p>

<p>By his personal entreaties and promises to pay his men, about one hundred
of them reënlisted. The others he sent home, with despatches, and
with M. Rocheblave, the late commander at Kaskaskia, as a prisoner, to
Governor Henry at Williamsburg.<a name="FNanchor_1506_1506" id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> His four companies he soon filled up
with resident French recruits, and pretended that he could get all the American
soldiers he wanted at the Falls of the Ohio.</p>

<p>He next undertook the pacification and control of the Indian tribes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[724]</a></span>
His sudden appearance in the Illinois country and rapid capture of the
Western posts was the occasion of astonishment to the Western tribes;
and their chiefs from a range of five hundred miles flocked to Cahokia to
see the strange warrior of the "Big Knives." Clark met them there in
council with a stern and haughty dignity. Soft speeches to Indians before
they were under control he regarded as bad policy. He showed no fear in
their presence, and no anxiety for their friendship. He laid before them a
war-belt and a peace-belt, and told them to take their choice. If they did
not want to have their own women and children killed, they must stop killing
the women and children of the Americans. One chief after another
rose and made submissive speeches. He refused to smoke the peace-pipe
with any until he had heard from every tribe represented, and treaties were
concluded. All the tribes gave in their allegiance to the American cause,
and he had no further trouble with the Illinois Indians. The councils at
Cahokia lasted five weeks, and their influence extended to all the nations
around the great lakes. Captain Helm, under Clark's instructions, made
similar treaties with the Wabash Indians.</p>

<p>The training and discipline of his little army now received his attention,
and in order to conceal his weakness in numbers he allowed no parade
except of the guards. About Christmas, 1778, he heard from his spies
that Governor Hamilton was preparing to send an army into the Illinois
country; and later, that Hamilton with eight hundred men had descended
the Wabash and recaptured Vincennes.<a name="FNanchor_1507_1507" id="FNanchor_1507_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a> Early in January Hamilton sent
a scouting party to Kaskaskia to waylay and capture Clark, and it came
near succeeding while Clark was returning from a visit to Cahokia. This
party was supposed to be an advanced guard of Hamilton's army, and every
preparation was made to defend the town. On the 29th of January, 1779,
Colonel François Vigo,<a name="FNanchor_1508_1508" id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a> a Spanish merchant of St. Louis, arrived from Vincennes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span>
and reported that Hamilton had sent away his Indians and most of
his troops, leaving only eighty in the garrison; and that he was intending
to collect them in the spring, and with five hundred Southern Indians make
a campaign against Kaskaskia.</p>

<p>Clark now conceived the project of capturing Vincennes with his small
force before Hamilton could reassemble his troops, and its execution forms
one of the most daring and brilliant expeditions in American warfare. On
the 4th of February he sent off a large boat called "The Willing", mounting
two four-pounders and six swivels, under command of Lieutenant John
Rogers, who had forty-six men and orders to sail for the Wabash, and, ten
leagues below Vincennes, await further orders. On the next day Clark
crossed the Kaskaskia River with one hundred and seventy men, marched
three miles, and encamped. On the 7th he began his painful march across
the Illinois prairies, a distance as a bird flies of one hundred and forty
miles, but as he marched, of more than two hundred. The winter was breaking
up, the rivers were swollen, the prairies were covered with water and
ice, and the mud was such as can only be found in that rich alluvial country.
On the 13th they reached the banks of the Little Wabash. Before
them lay a stretch of water three miles wide and from three to four feet
deep. They made a canoe, and on the 15th ferried the ammunition across
and took the men over the channel, marching them the remaining distance
through the water. On the 16th their provisions ran short. Major Bowman's
journal says: "17th, marched early; crossed several runs very deep;
came to the Embarrass River; tried to cross; found it impossible; travelled
till 8 o'clock in mud and water, but could find no place to encamp on.
18th, came in sight of the swollen banks of the Wabash; made rafts for
four men to cross and go up to the town and steal boats; but they spend
day and night in the water to no purpose, for there is not one foot of dry
land to be found. 19th, Colonel Clark sent two men in the canoe down
the river to meet the bateau 'The Willing,' with orders to come on day
and night, that being our last hope, and we starving; no provisions of any
sort now two days." On the 20th they found some canoes and killed a
deer. On the 21st the little army plunged into the water and waded for
more than a league,&mdash;Clark says "breast high", Bowman says "sometimes
to the neck", the boats picking up such as were likely to drown. On
the 22d, says Bowman, "Clark encourages his men, which gave them great
spirits; marched on in the waters; those that were weak and famished
went in the canoes; no provisions yet; Lord help us." On the 23d they
crossed the Wabash, wading four miles through water breast-high. "We
plunged into it with courage, Colonel Clark being first, taking care to have
the boats take those that were weak and numbed with the cold." Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span>
crossed, they captured an Indian canoe with some buffalo meat, tallow and
corn, which were made into a broth and fed to the famishing men, who
soon recovered their strength.<a name="FNanchor_1509_1509" id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a> No tidings had come from "The Willing",
for she had not yet arrived.<a name="FNanchor_1510_1510" id="FNanchor_1510_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a></p>

<p>The town was but a few miles distant, and was unaware of his approach.
Clark resolved not to delay the attack until the boat had arrived with his
artillery and ammunition, but to capture the fort immediately with the men
and means he had. Before moving on the town he wrote a proclamation,
addressed to the inhabitants, worded in his peculiar style, and advising all
"friends of the king to instantly repair to the fort, join their <i>hair-buying</i><a name="FNanchor_1511_1511" id="FNanchor_1511_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a>
general, and fight like men. True friends of liberty may depend on being
well treated; but they must keep out of the streets, for every one I find
in arms on my arrival I shall treat as an enemy." The same evening he
marched, took possession of the town, and threw up earthworks in front of
the fort. The firing began immediately, and was kept up all night. His
men lay in rifle-pits within thirty yards of the walls, the cannon of the
fort being so mounted that they could not be trained upon them. Whenever
port-holes of the fort were opened to fire, the besiegers poured in a
volley of musket-balls, and severely wounded seven of the garrison. Two
pieces of cannon were silenced in fifteen minutes. In the morning, Clark
summoned Hamilton to surrender, stating that if he were obliged to storm
the fort, Hamilton would receive the treatment due to a murderer. "Beware",
he added, "of destroying stores of any kind, or any papers or letters
that are in your possession; for, by heavens, if you do, there will be
no mercy shown you."<a name="FNanchor_1512_1512" id="FNanchor_1512_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> While these negotiations were pending, Clark's
men took the first full meal they had had for eight days. The summons to
surrender was refused, and the firing went on.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Governor
Hamilton asked for a truce of three days, and for a conference as to terms.
Clark replied that he would consider no other terms than surrender at discretion;
but that he, with Captain Helm, would meet "Mr. Hamilton at the
church." At this time a party of Indians came in whom Hamilton had
sent to the Ohio for scalps. Clark's men tomahawked them in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[728]</a></span>
fort, and threw their bodies into the river.<a name="FNanchor_1513_1513" id="FNanchor_1513_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a> Clark's terms of capitulation
were accepted; and at ten o'clock the next day (the 25th) the fort and its
stores were delivered up, and the garrison of seventy-nine officers and men
surrendered as prisoners of war.<a name="FNanchor_1514_1514" id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a> The only casualty to Clark's soldiers was
one man slightly wounded.</p>

<p>Hearing that a convoy with provisions, clothing, and ammunition was on
its way to Vincennes from Detroit, Clark sent fifty-three men in boats up the
Wabash to intercept it.<a name="FNanchor_1515_1515" id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a> They met the convoy one hundred and twenty miles
up the river, and captured it, with forty prisoners and despatches for Hamilton.<a name="FNanchor_1516_1516" id="FNanchor_1516_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a>
The value of the goods captured was £10,000, and Clark's men, who
had been suffering for clothing and supplies, were bountifully provided for.
Clothing to the value of £800 was laid aside for the troops which Clark
expected would soon join him in an expedition, which he was planning, for
the capture of Detroit.<a name="FNanchor_1517_1517" id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a> This project had been on his mind ever since he
came into the Illinois country, and all his energies were now directed to its
execution. Not being able with his few troops to guard so many prisoners,
he sent Governor Hamilton, his principal officers, and a few other
persons who had made themselves especially obnoxious by being out with
Indian parties, as prisoners of war to Virginia, and paroled the remainder.<a name="FNanchor_1518_1518" id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[729]</a></span></p>

<p>Having met and established friendly relations with the chiefs of the
neighboring tribes, he placed Captain Helm in charge of the civil affairs
of Vincennes, Lieutenant Brashear in command of the fort with a garrison
of forty men, and embarked, on March 20, 1779, for Kaskaskia, on board
"The Willing" and seven other boats. They made the trip of three hundred
and fifty miles without casualty, and on arriving at Kaskaskia, after
an absence of seven weeks, were welcomed by Captain Robert George, who,
with his company of forty-one men, had come up from New Orleans, and
was in command of the post.</p>

<p>The military conquest of the Illinois country now being complete, a
civil government was forthwith established. The Assembly of Virginia
was prompt to act as soon as the capture of Kaskaskia was known. In
October, 1778, the territory northwest of the Ohio was constituted a county
of Virginia, and was named the county of Illinois.<a name="FNanchor_1519_1519" id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a> On December 12th,
Colonel John Todd was appointed county lieutenant. The governor in his
letter of instructions directed Colonel Todd to coöperate with Colonel Clark
in his military operations, to have care for the happiness, increase, and prosperity
of the county, and to see that justice was duly administered. Colonel
Todd's appointment was especially pleasing to Colonel Clark, who said, in
writing to George Mason: "The civil department in the Illinois had heretofore
robbed me of too much of my time that ought to be spent in military
reflection. I was now likely to be relieved by Colonel John Todd. I was
anxious for his arrival and happy in his appointment, as the greatest intimacy
and friendship had subsisted between us. I now saw myself rid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[730]</a></span>
a piece of trouble that I had no delight in."<a name="FNanchor_1520_1520" id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a> Colonel Todd arrived in Kaskaskia
in May, 1779. Courts of justice and militia companies were immediately
organized in Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes,<a name="FNanchor_1521_1521" id="FNanchor_1521_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> and, from the
lack of American citizens who were qualified, nearly all the official positions
were filled by French residents.<a name="FNanchor_1522_1522" id="FNanchor_1522_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a> A complete civil government was organized
and regularly administered in the Northwest territory until the treaty
of peace with Great Britain in 1783. This local government became an
important factor in the negotiations for that treaty, with reference to the
question of boundaries.</p>

<p>Colonel Clark had promises of troops from Virginia and Kentucky for his
Detroit expedition, and he was to meet them at Vincennes. Arriving there
in July, 1779, he found only thirty from Kentucky of the three hundred
promised him. There were no tidings of recruits from Virginia; and Major
Bowman, his trusty companion in former campaigns, was fighting the Shawanese
on the Ohio at a disadvantage.<a name="FNanchor_1523_1523" id="FNanchor_1523_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> Clark, being very impatient, sent
out officers to recruit in the settlements, and for this purpose went himself
to the Falls of the Ohio. Here he received a letter from Jefferson, now
the governor of Virginia, giving him new assurances of Virginia troops for
the Detroit expedition, and stating that it was his intention to build a fort
on the Mississippi, below the mouth of the Ohio, in order to strengthen
the claim of the United States to the Mississippi as its western boundary.
The duty of building this fort was later committed to and performed by
Colonel Clark. The fort was completed in June, 1780, and was called Fort
Jefferson.<a name="FNanchor_1524_1524" id="FNanchor_1524_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a></p>

<p>At this time twelve hundred Indians and Canadians from Detroit, with
artillery, under Captain Byrd, were coming silently down the Big Miami
river to invade Kentucky and help carry out a scheme of conquest soon
to be explained. They went up the Licking river, captured two stockades,
which were defenceless against cannon, committed the customary British
and Indian barbarities, and, although meeting with no opposition, retreated
as rapidly as they came. In explanation of the sudden retreat it has been
said that the British commander was shocked at the brutal conduct of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[731]</a></span>
Indians, and would proceed no further.<a name="FNanchor_1525_1525" id="FNanchor_1525_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a> In view of the habitual practice
of the British commanders at Detroit of paying the Indians for American
scalps,<a name="FNanchor_1526_1526" id="FNanchor_1526_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a>&mdash;a practice Clark alludes to in the term "hair-buying general",
which he applied to Governor Hamilton,&mdash;this explanation is charitable,
but it seems hardly probable. It is more likely that Captain Byrd and his
Indians heard the report that Colonel Clark had suddenly returned from
his defence of St. Louis and the Illinois country against Sinclair's Indians,
and was likely to make it a busy summer for the invaders in Kentucky.
Clark with two companions proceeded to Harrodsburg to enlist troops.
He there closed the land office, and soon had a thousand men with artillery
at the mouth of the Licking, ready for an expedition across the Ohio. He
moved rapidly upon Chilicothe and other Indian towns, which he destroyed,
with their crops, and also a British trading-post where the Indians had been
supplied with arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>Clark's favorite scheme of organizing an expedition for the capture of
Detroit was delayed, and his spirit chafed under the disappointment. Jefferson
was deeply interested in the project, and, Sept. 26, 1780, wrote an
earnest letter to General Washington, urging him to furnish the means.
"We have long meditated the attempt, under the direction of Colonel Clark,
but the expense has obliged us to decline it. We could furnish the men,
provisions, and every[thing] necessary, except powder, had we the money.
When I speak of furnishing the men, I mean they should be militia, for
such is the popularity of Colonel Clark, and the confidence of the Western
people in him, that he could raise the requisite number at any time."<a name="FNanchor_1527_1527" id="FNanchor_1527_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a> On
Dec. 15th he writes again, in more urgent terms, and says: "The regular
force Colonel Clark already has, with a proper draft from the militia beyond
the Alleghany, and that of three or four of our northern counties, will be
adequate for the reduction of Fort Detroit, in the opinion of Colonel Clark....
I am the more urgent for an immediate order, because Colonel Clark
awaits here your Excellency's answer by the express."<a name="FNanchor_1528_1528" id="FNanchor_1528_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a> Washington was
also impressed with the military importance of Clark's expedition, and,
Dec. 29th, instructed Colonel Brodhead, in command at Fort Pitt, to furnish
Clark with the artillery and stores he required, and such a detachment of
Brodhead's and Gibson's regiments as could be spared.<a name="FNanchor_1529_1529" id="FNanchor_1529_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a></p>

<p>Colonel Brodhead did not acknowledge General Washington's instructions,
which were placed in Colonel Clark's hands to deliver, until the 25th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[732]</a></span>
of February, and they did not reach him until the 21st.<a name="FNanchor_1530_1530" id="FNanchor_1530_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a> During this interval
of nearly two months, Benedict Arnold, with fifteen hundred British
troops, sailed up the James River, and was ravaging Virginia, which, from
the absence of its Continental soldiers, was almost defenceless.<a name="FNanchor_1531_1531" id="FNanchor_1531_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a> In this
emergency, Colonel Clark tendered his services to Baron Steuben in her
defence, and with a small body of militia received the enemy in Indian
and Western fashion. Jefferson, writing, Jan. 18, 1781, to the Virginia delegates
in Congress, says: "Baron Steuben had not reached Hood's by
eight or ten miles, when they [the enemy] arrived there. They landed
their whole army in the night, Arnold attending in person. Captain Clark
(of Kaskaskias) had been sent forward with two hundred and forty men by
Baron Steuben; and, having properly disposed of them in ambuscade, gave
them a deliberate fire, which killed seventeen on the spot and wounded
thirteen."<a name="FNanchor_1532_1532" id="FNanchor_1532_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a></p>

<p>Colonel Clark's outfit at Fort Pitt went on very slowly and with many
embarrassments. Writing, with the rank of brigadier-general, to Washington,
on the 26th of May, 1781, he says: "The invasion of Virginia put it
out of the power of the governor to furnish me with the number of men
proposed for the enterprise to the West."<a name="FNanchor_1533_1533" id="FNanchor_1533_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a> Colonel Brodhead did not feel
that he could spare the troops at the fort which were promised. Clark's
only hope was now in getting Continental troops. "But I have not yet
lost sight of Detroit", he says, and wishes to set out on the expedition
early in June. He was doomed to disappointment. The summer and autumn
wore away, and the obstacles in his path increased. The troops he
expected were employed elsewhere; the Western Indians again became
hostile, and there was a general apprehension among the settlements of
incursions upon them from Detroit by the British and their Indian allies.
The opportunity of capturing Detroit had passed. General Irvine, in command
at Fort Pitt, writing to Washington, Dec. 2, 1781, says: "I presume
your Excellency has been informed by the governor of Virginia, or General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[733]</a></span>
Clark, of the failure of his expedition." He reports General Clark at
the Rapids of the Ohio with only seven hundred and fifty men, and "the
buffalo meat all rotten." "The general is apprehensive of a visit from
Detroit, and is not without fears the settlement will be obliged to break up
unless reinforcements soon arrive from Virginia."<a name="FNanchor_1534_1534" id="FNanchor_1534_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a></p>

<p>At this point, George Rogers Clark, at the age of twenty-nine years,
ceased to be a factor in Western history. His favorite scheme had failed
under circumstances which he could not control. No command was offered
him in the Continental army. With a feeling that he was neglected, that
his eminent services were not appreciated, and with a sense of wrong that
his private property had been sacrificed to pay public debts,<a name="FNanchor_1535_1535" id="FNanchor_1535_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a> his mind became
depressed, and he fell into social habits which tended to increase his
despondency. In November, 1782, he conducted a force of ten hundred
and fifty men against the Indians on the Miami, took ten scalps and seven

British trading-post;<a name="FNanchor_1536_1536" id="FNanchor_1536_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a> but he displayed none of the brilliancy shown in his
earlier campaigns. He was discharged from the service of Virginia July
2, 1783, with a letter of thanks for his services from the governor. The
financial distress of the State was assigned as the motive for his discharge.<a name="FNanchor_1537_1537" id="FNanchor_1537_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a></p>

<p>In March, 1782, the frontier settlers, without provocation and in cold
blood, butchered nearly a hundred "Christian Indians" in the Moravian
mission settlements on the Muskingum. These Indians, under the instruction
of their teachers, had adopted the habits and pursuits of civilized life,
and were non-resistant in their principles. Their villages, Schönbrun, Gnadenhütten,
and Salem, were regularly laid out, with houses and chapels
built of squared logs and having shingled roofs. They had farms yielding
abundant crops, and schools where the children were educated. Visitors
from Western tribes far and near came to look upon the strange sight, and
verify the reports which had reached them of the happiness and prosperity
of the "Christian Indians." The number of converts had increased so
rapidly that good Father David Zeisberger and his assistant, John Heckewelder,
the missionaries, believed that the whole Delaware tribe would soon
come under their influence.<a name="FNanchor_1538_1538" id="FNanchor_1538_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a></p>

<p>With the outbreak of the American Revolution the troubles of these gentle
missionaries and their converts began. They were between two raging
fires. Their peace principles forbade their engaging in the conflict or favoring
either side, although their sympathies, which they could not express,
were with the Americans. As a natural consequence of their neutrality,
they fell under the suspicion and hatred of both parties. The British at
Detroit were eager to secure all the Ohio tribes in their interest, and the
missionaries made the Delawares pledge themselves to remain neutral. It
was also suspected, and it was doubtless true, that the Moravians gave
information to the Americans as to the movements of hostile tribes. The
British, therefore, were of the opinion that the Moravian settlements were
in secret alliance with the enemy, and they resolved to break up the settlements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[735]</a></span>
and remove the inhabitants to Sandusky.<a name="FNanchor_1539_1539" id="FNanchor_1539_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a> On the other hand, the
settlers on the frontiers of Pennsylvania and Virginia hated the "Christian
Indians", first, and chiefly, because they were Indians; and secondly, because
they allowed the Wyandots to come among them, and had fed and
hospitably treated other hostile tribes which had made raids on the white
settlements. In the autumn of 1781 Colonel David Williamson raised a
company of volunteers in western Pennsylvania to visit the Moravian
towns and remove the inhabitants to Fort Pitt; but in the execution of
the scheme he was anticipated by the British and their Indian allies, the
Shawanese,<a name="FNanchor_1540_1540" id="FNanchor_1540_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a> Wyandots, and Hurons, who were there before him. On
August 10, 1781, one Matthew Elliott, in the service of the governor of Detroit,
and Half-King, a chief of the Hurons, appeared at Gnadenhütten with
three hundred whites and Indians flying the British flag. Without offering
personal violence, they urged the missionaries and converts to abandon the
Muskingum country, and place themselves under the protection of the
British at Sandusky, on the ground that they were in constant peril from
the white settlers on the border. Having declined the offer of British
protection, their fears were appealed to, their cattle were shot, and their
houses ravaged by the Indians. Worn out by fear and persecution, on
September 11th they turned their unwilling steps from the valley of the
Muskingum towards Sandusky, under the charge of their uninvited escorts.<a name="FNanchor_1541_1541" id="FNanchor_1541_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a>
Having reached their destination, the missionaries were sent to Detroit
to answer before the governor to charges made against them, and were
acquitted.<a name="FNanchor_1542_1542" id="FNanchor_1542_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a></p>

<p>During the winter the captives at Sandusky suffered from want of proper
shelter and food, and a party of a hundred went back to the deserted villages
to gather corn which had been left standing in the fields. A report
of their return reached the white settlements, and Colonel Williamson,
without any civil or military authority, again picked up a company of volunteers
and started for the Muskingum country. On his former expedition
he brought back several Indians whom the British party had overlooked,
and after the form of a trial at Fort Pitt they were released. The colonel
was blamed by the people that he had not shot the Indians at sight. Arriving
at the deserted towns, he found the "Christian Indians" harvesting
their corn and suspecting no danger. He told them that he had come to
remove them to Fort Pitt, and ordered them to a building, where they were
confined. A vote was then taken by his men, whether the prisoners should
be taken to Fort Pitt or put to death. Only eighteen voted to spare their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[736]</a></span>
lives. The captives were informed of their fate, and were told that, "inasmuch
as they were Christians, they would be given one night to prepare for
death in a Christian manner." In the morning they were tomahawked and
butchered in the most shocking manner. "Thus", said Loskei, the Moravian
bishop, "ninety-six persons magnified the name of the Lord by patiently
meeting a cruel death."<a name="FNanchor_1543_1543" id="FNanchor_1543_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Another expedition, known as the "Crawford Campaign", was forthwith
organized, the purpose of which was to exterminate the Wyandots and
the Moravian Delawares on the Sandusky, and to give no quarter to any
Indian. Colonel Williamson was again the chief organizer, and probably
the same men were enlisted who had disgraced themselves on the Muskingum.
Colonel William Crawford,<a name="FNanchor_1544_1544" id="FNanchor_1544_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a> who had seen much service in the
Continental army, was put in command, much against his wishes, and Williamson
was second in rank. On May 25, 1782, four hundred well equipped
and mounted backwoodsmen, breathing vengeance against the red men,
started out from Mingo Bottom, on the Ohio, for the Sandusky country, a
journey of one hundred and fifty miles. Nineteen days later a remnant of
them returned to the same spot, a defeated and demoralized rabble, with a
loss of seventy killed, wounded, and missing. The Indians knew their
plans, and had time to summon the neighboring tribes and to procure British
soldiers and artillery from Detroit. Two battles were fought, in which
they were outnumbered and outgeneralled, and it was fortunate that any of
them escaped. Stragglers came in daily, reporting the sufferings and cruel
tortures they had undergone, but none of them could report the fate of
Colonel Crawford. He was captured, and the barbarity of the Indian mind
exhausted itself in the ingenuity of the tortures with which he was put to
death.<a name="FNanchor_1545_1545" id="FNanchor_1545_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[737]</a></span></p>

<p>On May 26, 1780, a raid was made on the Spanish post of St. Louis by
a party of fifteen hundred Indians and a hundred and forty English and
Canadian traders, fitted out by Lieutenant-Governor Sinclair, of Michilimacinac,
and led by a Sioux chief named Wabasha. The affair lasted only
a few hours, and no assault was made on the fortified enclosure; but a
considerable number of persons found on their farms or intercepted outside
of the palisades were shot or captured. A portion of the party crossed the
Mississippi and made a similar raid on Cahokia. They all then left for
their northern homes as rapidly as they came,&mdash;some by way of the Wisconsin
and Fox rivers, and others by way of the Illinois River to Chicago,
where Sinclair had two vessels awaiting them.</p>

<p>This affair has been the occasion of many conflicting statements<a name="FNanchor_1546_1546" id="FNanchor_1546_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a> as to
the time it occurred, the number of persons killed and captured, and how
it happened that so large a body of Indians in the British service came so
far and did so little which was warlike. It has been often asserted, and as
often denied, that George Rogers Clark, at the request of the Spanish
commandant, was at St. Louis at the time of the incursion, or so near as
to render efficient service. The purpose and character of this expedition,
and the causes of its failure, are explained by contemporary documents<a name="FNanchor_1547_1547" id="FNanchor_1547_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a>
recently published, which were not accessible to earlier writers. It was a
part of a much larger scheme ordered, and perhaps devised, by the cabinet
in London, to capture New Orleans and all the Spanish posts west of the
Mississippi and the Illinois country.<a name="FNanchor_1548_1548" id="FNanchor_1548_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span></p>

<p>On May 8, 1779, Spain declared war against Great Britain, and on July 8
authorized her American subjects to make war upon Natchez and other
English posts on the east bank of the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_1549_1549" id="FNanchor_1549_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a> On June 17, Lord
George Germain, secretary for the colonies, wrote to General Haldimand,
informing him that Spain had declared war, and that hostilities were to
begin at once; and he was ordered to attack New Orleans and reduce the
Spanish posts on the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_1550_1550" id="FNanchor_1550_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a> These orders were issued in a circular
letter sent to all the Western governors. Sinclair acknowledged the circular
February 17, 1780, and informed the general that he had taken steps
to engage the Sioux and other tribes west of the Mississippi for the
expedition.<a name="FNanchor_1551_1551" id="FNanchor_1551_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a> De Peyster at Detroit wrote to Haldimand, March 8, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[739]</a></span>
had taken measures "to facilitate Sinclair's movements on the Mississippi,
and be of use to Brigadier Campbell, if he has not already taken New
Orleans. The Wabash Indians will amuse Clark at the Falls of the Ohio."<a name="FNanchor_1552_1552" id="FNanchor_1552_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a>
The general scheme here touched upon was, that General Campbell, stationed
at Pensacola, should, with a British fleet and army, come up the
Mississippi to Natchez, and there meet the Indian expedition sent by
Sinclair down the western bank of the river, which was under instructions
to capture and destroy the Spanish posts on its way. The united forces
were then to expel the Spaniards from all their settlements on the lower
Mississippi. The scheme miscarried. Governor Galvez, of New Orleans,
a person of great ability and energy, no sooner heard of the declaration of
war against Great Britain than he raised a fleet and army to capture the
British posts on the Mississippi; and in September, 1779, the forts at
Manchac, Baton Rouge, and Natchez, with their garrisons, surrendered to
him. He took also eight English vessels employed in transport service, and
in carrying the supply of provisions to Pensacola.<a name="FNanchor_1553_1553" id="FNanchor_1553_1553"></a><a href="#Footnote_1553_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a> Galvez next turned his
attention to Mobile, which he captured March 14, 1780; and then to Pensacola,
which surrendered May 9, 1781. Brigadier Campbell, therefore, in
May, 1780, was otherwise engaged than in executing the splendid scheme
which had been assigned to him by the British cabinet and his superior
officer, General Haldimand.<a name="FNanchor_1554_1554" id="FNanchor_1554_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[740]</a></span></p>

<p>It does not appear that, at the time of the attack on St. Louis, Sinclair,
or the party of Indians and traders engaged in the expedition, had heard of
the successes of the Spaniards on the lower Mississippi, and of the collapse
of the main scheme.<a name="FNanchor_1555_1555" id="FNanchor_1555_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a> Haldimand furnished Sinclair with the latter
information in a letter written at Quebec, June 19th, twenty-four days after
the fiasco at St. Louis, and supposing, apparently, that the expedition had
not moved from Prairie du Chien. "I have received", he said, "your letters
of the 15th and 17th of February, and much approve of the measures
they advise me you have taken in the arrangement of the war parties intended
to favor the operation of Brig. General Campbell, agreeably to the
circular letter forwarded to you.... It is very unfortunate that the [Campbell]
expedition should have been either abandoned or not undertaken so
early as was intended, owing probably to the fleet having been dispersed,
which, from what has happened upon the Mississippi, would appear has
been the case. The intermediate attacks you have proposed the Indians
should make will, however, answer a good end."<a name="FNanchor_1556_1556" id="FNanchor_1556_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a></p>

<p>That Colonel George Rogers Clark was present on the opposite bank of
the river at the time of the St. Louis attack, and was there by request of
the Spanish commandant, Leyba, and for the defence of the Illinois country,
can no longer be doubted.<a name="FNanchor_1557_1557" id="FNanchor_1557_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a> The proof is in a report of Col. John Montgomery,
printed in the <i>Calendar of Virginia State Papers</i> (iii. 443). Montgomery
was one of Clark's four captains in his Kaskaskia campaign, and at
the period of which he speaks was in command, under Clark, of the post of
Kaskaskia. In his report he states: "In the spring of 1780 we [at Kaskaskia]
were threatened with an invasion. Colonel Clark, being informed
of it, hurried with a small body of troops from the Falls to the mouth of
the Ohio, where he received other expresses from the Spanish commandant
and myself, and luckily joined me at Cohos [Cahokia] in time enough to
save the country from impending ruin, as the enemy appeared in great
force within twenty-four hours after his arrival. Finding they were likely
to be disappointed in their design, they retired after doing some mischief
on the Spanish shore, which would have been prevented if unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[741]</a></span>
the high wind had not prevented the signals being heard." It is evident
from this statement that the defence of his own territory was Clark's chief
motive for being present on this occasion, and that the invitation of and
friendship for the Spanish commandant at St. Louis were mere incidents in
the transaction. "Prisoners and deserters from the enemy confirmed the
report", says Montgomery, "that a body of a thousand English and Indian
troops were on their march to the Kentucky country with a train of artillery;<a name="FNanchor_1558_1558" id="FNanchor_1558_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a>
and the colonel, knowing the situation of that country, appeared to
be alarmed, and resolved to get there previous to their arrival.... After
giving me instructions, he left Cohos on the 4th of June, with a small escort,
for the mouth of the Ohio, on his route to Kentucky." The orders he left
with Col. Montgomery were to pursue the Indians retreating up the Illinois
River and attack their towns about the time they were disbanding, and to
proceed as far as Rock River. "I immediately", says Montgomery, "proceeded
to the business I was ordered to do, and marched three hundred
and fifty men to the lakeopen [?] on the Illinois River;<a name="FNanchor_1559_1559" id="FNanchor_1559_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a> and from thence
to the Rock River, destroying the towns and crops, the enemy not daring
to fight me."<a name="FNanchor_1560_1560" id="FNanchor_1560_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a></p>

<p>How much the presence of Clark near the scene of action contributed
to the demoralization of the Indian forces is not mentioned by any of the
contemporary writers. It is known, however, that his name was a terror
to the savage tribes; and Sinclair, in organizing his expedition, found this
dread of Clark among the Sioux and other nations west of the Mississippi.
He wrote to Captain Brehm, Haldimand's aide-de-camp, February 15, 1780,
that there was nothing in Hamilton's disaster which ought to alarm the
Sioux, and that "many of them never heard of it. The short-sighted
harpies, which necessity has thrown into the service, dwell upon the
stories they hear from fretful bands of Delawares, Mascoutins, and Kickapoos
near where the event happened. Admit that the disaster has all the
supposed consequent misfortunes, it is still more necessary for us to engage
the Indians to take a part, which will at once declare their enmity to the
party they are engaged to act against."<a name="FNanchor_1561_1561" id="FNanchor_1561_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a> "The party" Sinclair had in
mind was evidently Clark himself; and with him the chief object of the
expedition was to recapture the Illinois country.</p>

<p>The general scheme devised by Lord George Germain for the complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[742]</a></span>
conquest of the West,&mdash;of bringing down a large party of northwestern
Indians upon St. Louis and Ste. Geneviève; of sending an expedition
from Detroit to invade Kentucky and keep Colonel Clark busy; of bringing
up the Mississippi to Natchez, under General Campbell, a fleet and
army, there to unite with the northern expeditions, and from thence to
capture the Illinois country and all the Spanish settlements on the river&mdash;was
an excellent one, and had every promise of success. St. Louis was
in no condition to resist an assault, and rank cowardice marked the conduct
of the governor and the few soldiers stationed at the post when the Indian
raiders appeared.<a name="FNanchor_1562_1562" id="FNanchor_1562_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a> The Illinois country was very feebly garrisoned, and
not a soldier or a shilling had ever been contributed by the Continental
Congress for its conquest or defence. The scheme failed because of the
promptness and exceptional activity of the Spaniards under Governor
Galvez, and the watchfulness and energy of Colonel Clark. It was the
last concerted effort of Great Britain to regain possession of the West;
as the campaign of Clinton and Cornwallis, with its result one year later
at Yorktown, was her expiring effort on the Atlantic coast.<a name="FNanchor_1563_1563" id="FNanchor_1563_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a> If the
Western scheme had been successful, the country north of the Ohio River
would have been a part of the province of Quebec, and might have remained
Canadian territory to this day. In negotiating two and three years
later the treaty of peace with Great Britain under such conditions, it is
difficult to conceive what boundaries the United States could have secured.
Spain therefore rendered an invaluable service to the United States by
enabling George Rogers Clark to hold with his Virginia troops the country
he had conquered from the British, until the treaty of peace confirmed to
the nation the Mississippi River as its western boundary.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this important service, there was nothing friendly and
disinterested, at this time, in the relations of Spain to the United States.
She was looking solely to her own interests, and refused to acknowledge
the independence of the United States, or enter into a treaty of alliance
except on the most degrading conditions. She must be allowed the exclusive
right to navigate the Mississippi, the undisturbed possession of the
Floridas and of the east bank of the Mississippi, which she had captured
from the British. Spain asserted that the United States had no territorial
rights west of the Alleghanies, and that their western boundaries were
defined by the royal proclamation of October 7, 1763.<a name="FNanchor_1564_1564" id="FNanchor_1564_1564"></a><a href="#Footnote_1564_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a> The captures of
Manchac, Baton Rouge, Natchez, and Mobile had awakened her military
zeal, and nothing less than the possession of the entire Mississippi Valley
would then satisfy her territorial ambition. French diplomacy favored
some of these extraordinary claims of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_1565_1565" id="FNanchor_1565_1565"></a><a href="#Footnote_1565_1565" class="fnanchor">[1565]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[743]</a></span></p>

<p>For the purpose of strengthening the Spanish claim to territory east of
the Mississippi, the governor of St. Louis, Don Francisco Cruvat, sent out
on the 2d of January, 1781, an expedition to capture St. Joseph, an English
fort situated near the present site of Niles, Michigan. Although
two hundred and twenty leagues distant, this was the nearest post to St.
Louis which raised the British flag. The expedition was in command of
Captain Eugenio Pourré, and comprised sixty-five militiamen (of whom
thirty were Spaniards) and sixty Indians. The journey, made in the depth
of winter across a trackless country, each man on foot carrying his provisions
and equipments, was a daring exploit, and it was successful in accomplishing
its immediate purpose. They took the fort in the name of his
most Catholic Majesty, made prisoners of the few English soldiers found
in it, divided the provisions and stores among their own Indians and those
living near, and returned to St. Louis early in March, with the English flag,
which Captain Pourré delivered with due ceremony to Governor Cruvat.<a name="FNanchor_1566_1566" id="FNanchor_1566_1566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1566_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a>
The treaty of peace, which it is not the purpose of this chapter to discuss,
brought this and other shallow pretensions on the part of the Spaniards to
territorial rights east of the Mississippi River to an end.<a name="FNanchor_1567_1567" id="FNanchor_1567_1567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1567_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> campaign of Yorktown over, Rochambeau made his headquarters at Williamsburg (Parton's <i>Jefferson</i>,
ch. 29), while Washington, having dispatched two thousand men south under St. Clair (instructions in
Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, viii. 198) to reinforce Greene, moved with the rest of the army, by land and water, to
the neighborhood of the Hudson (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, viii. 199, 200; Irving's <i>Washington</i>, iv. ch. 29, 30;
Kapp's <i>Steuben</i>, ch. 23; Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. ch. 5). Washington at once acted in conjunction with Congress
to prevent the country lapsing into a neglect of the war establishment through over-confidence in the
effects of the capture of Cornwallis. In April, 1782, Washington left Philadelphia and joined the army, establishing
his headquarters at Newburgh, in a house which is still standing. (Views of it are in <i>Mag. of Amer.
Hist.</i>, 1883, p. 357 (taken in 1834); Irving's <i>Washington</i>, quarto ed., iv. 434; W. H. Bartlett's <i>Hist. of U. S.</i>;

Cantonment of the Main Continental Army" <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, 1883, vol. x. 355), which is accompanied by
a plan of the camp near New Windsor. Simeon De Witt's maps of the locality and the camp are in the N. Y.
Hist. Soc. library. De Witt was the geographer of the American army, succeeding Erskine, who had died in
1780. Various orderly-books of this time are in the American Antiquarian Society library. Other papers on
the camp are in <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, Jan., 1884, p. 81; by J. T. Headley in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, lxiv. 651, and <i>Galaxy</i>,

<p>Washington and Congress were soon perplexed with the case of Capt. Joshua Huddy, and with a project of
retaliation for that officer's execution. Huddy, an officer of the New Jersey line, commanded a block-house at
Tom's River, New Jersey, and was there captured with his men by a band of refugee loyalists (W. S. Stryker's
<i>Capture of the Block-House at Tom's River</i>). Huddy was taken by Capt. Richard Lippincott, a New Jersey
loyalist, to Sandy Hook, where he was hanged on the pretence that he had been engaged in causing the death
of Philip White, a Tory, who had been killed while endeavoring to escape from his guard. Congress ordered
retaliation, and a young British officer, then a prisoner, Capt. Charles Asgill, was drawn by lot to suffer death
unless Clinton should surrender Lippincott. Clinton condemned the action of Lippincott, who was, however,
acquitted on trial, on the ground that his action was in accordance with instructions from the board of Associated
Loyalists (Jones's <i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i>, vol. ii. note xxix. p. 481). The execution of Asgill was postponed
by Washington in the hope of some compensating arrangement, and at the instance of Lady Asgill, the
young man's mother, the French monarch interceded with such effect that Congress, in November, 1782, ordered
Washington to set Asgill at liberty. (References: Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, i. 378; viii. 262, 265, 301-310, 336,

printed in the <i>Columbian Mag.</i>, Jan. and Feb., 1787. This young officer of twenty died as Gen. Sir Charles
Asgill in July, 1823. Cf. <i>Diplomatic Corresp.</i>, xi. 105, 128, 140; Irving's <i>Washington</i>, iv. ch. 29; Sparks's

<p>Early in May the news from England made it evident that the war was approaching an end, and the promised
release from further campaigning left the public mind in a better condition to comprehend how weak a
stay Congress had proved itself, and how insufficient was the power lodged in that body to compel the States
to do any and all acts necessary for the common good. The natural distrust which was created of the form of
government, whose success in carrying on the war had been largely fortuitous, was still more increased by the
difficulties yet to be encountered in disbanding an army, in satisfying its well-earned demands, and in organizing
a stable control for the future (Bancroft, final revision, vi. 59, etc.) It was not, then, surprising that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[745]</a></span>
notions of counteraction should in any minds take the form of a monarchical solution of the problem, and
this sentiment found expression in a letter, written by Col. Nicola, of the army, to Washington, in which it was
somewhat adroitly suggested that Washington should consent to be the head of a royal government. Washington
met the suggestion with an indignant and stern reply, and we hear nothing more of the subject (Sparks,
viii. 300, etc.; Irving, iv. 370).</p>

<p>Sir Guy Carleton was sent to relieve Sir Henry Clinton in New York, and he arrived early in May. His
instructions (April 4, 1782,&mdash;<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, lviii.; cf. Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, viii. 294-298) were to avoid hostilities
except for defence. He failed to open communication with Congress to treat for peace (Madison's
<i>Debates</i>, vol. i.; Rives's <i>Madison</i>, i. 331, 333). An account of the cantonments of the British about New York
just before this (Feb., 1782) is in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (xlix. vol. iii.). Clinton's account of his being relieved is
in Mahon, vii. App., p. xvii. It was not till August that Carleton's communications to Washington rendered
it certain that the concession of independence was a preliminary of the negotiations then going on for peace.
Active hostilities accordingly ceased on both sides, though a posture of caution and vigilance was still maintained
by each commander. The French, who had remained in Virginia, now joined (September) the Americans
on the Hudson. There is among the Rochambeau maps an excellent colored plan (no. 33), measuring
twenty inches wide by thirty high, showing the country from White Plains north, and called <i>Position des Armées
Amer. et Française à King's Ferry, Peak's Hill, et Hunt's Taverne, 17 Sept. et 20 Oct., 1782</i>. In
October the French under the Baron de Viomenil marched to Boston and embarked, while Rochambeau and
Chastellux sailed from Baltimore. On the final departure of the French see a paper by J. A. Stevens in the
<i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, vii. p. 1. The report on their departure, made to Congress, is dated Jan. 1, 1783,&mdash;<i>Secret
Journals</i>, iii. 267.</p>

<p>In Dec., 1782, the army had set forth in representations to Congress the sufferings which it had experienced
from the want of pay (<i>Journals of Congress</i>, iv. 206; Madison's <i>Debates</i>, etc., i. 256; Rives's <i>Madison</i>, i.
383; Morse's <i>Hamilton</i>, i. 114). Nothing satisfactory came of this appeal, and a movement of uncertain
extent, but seemingly having the countenance of officers of high rank, was aimed at producing action on the
part of the army, which might easily, if allowed to proceed, have passed beyond prudent control, till a claim
for redress of grievances might instigate an act of mutiny. Its chief manifestations were in two successive
anonymous addresses, circulated through the camp at Newburgh, which were written, as was later acknowledged,
by Major John Armstrong, a member of Gen. Gates's staff. Washington interposed at a meeting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[746]</a></span>
the officers (March 15, 1783), and by a timely address turned the current. The original autograph of his
address belongs to the Mass. Hist. Society, and that body issued a fac-simile edition of it (Boston, 1876), with
letters of Col. Pickering, Gov. John Brooks, Judge Dudley A. Tyng, and William A. Hayes, authenticating
the document, and describing the scene when Washington read it. Copies of the addresses made by Armstrong
himself are in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>, xlix. 1, 8, and they are given in Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, viii. 551; and
in a <i>Collection of papers, relative to half-pay and commutation of half-pay, granted by Congress to officers
of the army. Compiled by the permission of General Washington from the original papers in his possession</i>
(Fishkill, 1783). Cf. Sabin, iv. 14, 379. Washington at a later day, Feb. 23, 1797, wrote to Armstrong,
exonerating him from having intended any evil to the country (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, no. xxiv.). The genuineness
of this letter having been assailed, Armstrong (Nov. 27, 1830) wrote a letter asserting its truth, and this autograph
letter is in Harvard College library. More or less extended accounts of the incidents accompanying this
attempt to organize a coercion of the civil by the military power will be found in the lives of Washington by
Marshall (iv. 587); Sparks (viii. 369, 393); and Irving (iv. ch. 31); in Pickering's <i>Pickering</i> (i. ch. 29, 30, 31;

<p>A letter from Lafayette, who had gone to France, shortly afterwards arrived, announcing the signing of the
preliminary articles of peace; and the news being confirmed by a letter from Carleton, Washington, on April
19, the eighth anniversary of the day of Lexington, issued a proclamation announcing cessation of hostilities.

<p>Knox had suggested (Drake's <i>Knox</i>), and in April, 1783, the Society of the Cincinnati had been formed from
the officers of the army, with a plan of transmitting membership to descendants. It was intended as an
organization to perpetuate a brotherhood formed in arms, and to offer an organization which might conveniently
deliberate as occasion required upon the condition of the country. As a rule the principal civil leaders
of the Revolution looked upon the combination with disapproval (Wells's <i>Sam. Adams</i>, iii. 202; Austin's
<i>Gerry</i>, ch. 25; Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, x. 58; Bigelow's <i>Franklin</i>, iii. 247; John Adams, <i>Works</i>, ix. 524, called
it "the first step taken to deface our temple of liberty"), and even with dread, lest it might lend itself to the
creation of castes and the furtherance of schemes against the liberties of the country. There was a widespread
dissatisfaction among the people generally, not always temperately expressed, and years were required to remove
the apprehension so incontinently formed. The society was organized in the Verplanck house (view in
<i>Appleton's Journal</i>, xiv. 353); the fac-similes of the signatures to the original subscription are given in the
<i>Penna. Archives</i>, vol. xi., and a representation of a certificate signed by Washington is in Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>,
ii. 128. The bibliography of the society and its branches, by States, is given by Lloyd P. Smith in the
<i>Bulletin of the Philadelphia Library</i>, July, 1885. Particular reference may he made to the accounts and
expositions given in the <i>Penna. Hist. Soc. Memoirs</i> (1858), vi. pp. 15-55, by Alexander Johnston; <i>North
Amer. Review</i>, v. lxxvii. 267, by W. Sargent; <i>St. Clair Papers</i>, i. 590; Kapp's <i>Steuben</i>, ch. 26; E. M. Stone's

Amer. Hist.</i>, Sept., 1883, pp. 171, 235, 253.</p>

<p>On the 18th June, 1783, Washington from Newburgh, whither he had removed his headquarters from Verplanck's
after the departure of the French, issued his last circular letter to the States (Sparks, viii. 439; Irving,
iv. 394), full of counsel and warning.<a name="FNanchor_1568_1568" id="FNanchor_1568_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1568_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a></p>

<p>The troops were in large part dismissed on furlough, and finally, Congress (Oct. 18) by proclamation, directed
the disbandment of the army, to take effect Nov. 2 (<i>Secret Journals</i>, iii. 406). A small body was, however, still
kept together under Knox, to await the definitive form of the treaty. Washington now occupied a brief
space in making a journey with Gov. Clinton over the battlefields of Burgoyne's campaign. He then, at the
request of Congress, proceeded to Princeton, and was domiciled for a while at Rocky Hill, in order to be at
hand for conferences with that body. From this place, Nov. 2, 1783, he issued a farewell address to the army.
(Sparks, viii. 491; Irving, iv. 402; Pickering's <i>Pickering</i>, i. 488.)</p>

<p>The last surviving pensioner of the Revolution is called one Lemuel Cook in the <i>Amer. Hist. Record</i>, ii.
357. In 1864, what purported to be the record of the latest survivors of the war appeared in Elias B. Hillard's
<i>Last Men of the Revolution</i> (Hartford, 1864). An account of John Gray as the last soldier of the Revolution,
by J. M. Dalzell, was printed at Washington in 1868. B. P. Poore's <i>Descriptive Catal. of Gov't Publications</i>
will enable one to trace many of those soldiers whose claims came before Congress.</p>

<p>Carleton giving notice of his readiness to evacuate New York, Washington now returned to West Point,
and prepared to enter the city with Gov. Clinton on the appointed day. The general and the governor entered
the upper end of the town on Nov. 25, while the British embarked at the lower end. Valentine's <i>N. Y. City
Manual</i> for 1861 gives various documentary records, some in fac-simile. On Dec. 1 there were fireworks, a
broadside programme of which is in the cabinet of the Mass. Hist. Society. Trumbull painted a picture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[747]</a></span>
the scene of the evacuation, which is given in the <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, 1883, p. 387. The histories of New
York city commemorate the event, and there are illustrated papers on it in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, Nov., 1883 (vol.
lxvii. 609), and <i>Manhattan Mag.</i>, Dec., 1883. Cf. <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, xi. 42; Lieut.-Col. Smith's letter in <i>N. Y. City
during the Rev.</i> (N. Y., 1861); Irving's <i>Washington</i>, iv. ch. 33; Jones's <i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i> (ii. 504).
Some days after the British had gone, Washington met his principal officers (Dec. 4) in Fraunce's Tavern,
and bade them farewell.</p>

<p>This building stood on the corner of Pearl and Broad streets, N. Y., and was occupied by Washington as
headquarters when he entered the city after the British evacuated in 1783. The cut follows a view given in
Valentine's <i>N. Y. City Manual</i>, 1854, p. 547, accompanied by a paper by W. J. Davis. Cf. <i>Mag. of Amer.
Hist.</i>, iii. 144, 151, 152; Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 839; Gay's <i>Pict. Hist. U. S.</i>, iv. 90; Dawson's <i>Westchester</i>.
The opening chapter of McMaster's <i>History of the People of the United States</i>, (N. Y., 1883) describes the
appearance of New York city at this time, and indeed of the other principal American towns, and the habits
of living through the country. An account of New York at this time is also in the <i>Manhattan Mag.</i>, ii. 561.</p>

<p>Immediately leaving New York, Washington journeyed to Annapolis, where Congress was then assembled.
Here, on Dec. 23, he met Congress in the State House (view in <i>Columbian Mag.</i>, Jan., 1789; Lossing's
<i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 402), where he resigned his commission in an address. (Sparks, viii. 504, and App., xiv.; Marshall,
iv. 622. A fac-simile of the manuscript is given in the <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, 1881, vol. vii. 106. Cf. <i>Journals
of Congress</i>, iv. 318; Ridgeley's <i>Hist. of Annapolis</i>.) On Christmas Eve, Washington reached Mount
Vernon, once more a private gentleman.</p>

<p>Congress on the 14th Jan., 1784, sitting at Philadelphia, finally ratified the definitive treaty of peace.</p>

There is a notable instance in the case of the
judicial tenure. By the British Constitution, the
king is not only the fountain of justice, but by
a legal fiction he administers it in person, as
James I. once proposed to do; and on this theory
of actual presence, he chooses his representative
and removes him at pleasure. It follows that,
when the king dies, the authority of his representative
ceases. And such was the case until
the reign of William III., when it was attempted
to limit the king's prerogative, but with
only partial success. By 12 and 13 Will. III.
ch. 2 (1701), the judicial tenure was during good
behavior instead of the king's pleasure. But
George III., a most strenuous asserter of his
prerogative, in 1761, soon after his accession, declared
to the two Houses that he regarded the
independence of the judges as one of the best
securities of the rights and liberties of his subjects,
and recommended that they should hold
office, with settled and permanent salaries, during
good behavior, notwithstanding the demise
of the crown (<i>House Journal</i>, vol. xxviii. 1094);
and this became the law by I Geo. III. ch. 23.
Constitutionally the king sat in his provincial
courts as well as in British courts, and his surrender
of the prerogative ought to have extended
to the former. That, however, was not the decision
in 1763, when the New York Assembly
remonstrated at the appointment of Chief Justice
Prat, to hold during the king's pleasure, by
whom his salary was paid. This caused great
dissatisfaction in the colonies, and in Massachusetts
especially, in 1773, when the judges were
paid by the king. The matter was not free from
practical difficulties. The king had rights to the
revenue which colonial juries would not respect;
and consequently in 1698 Parliament set up admiralty
courts without juries. The king was
also interested in the administration of the civil
and criminal law; but unless the judges conducted
themselves so as to suit the people, the
representatives cut down their salaries,&mdash;that is,
starved them into compliance with the popular
will; consequently, the king thought it best not
only to retain but to use his prerogative, with
respect to the appointment, tenure, and pay of
the provincial judges.</p>

Such, at least, seems to be the effect of the
words "in English-built shipping", in the act of
1663, excluding those "of the built and belonging
to" the colonies which were permitted by
the act of 1660. But were the commodities and
manufactures of England included among those
of "Europe" which could be exported to the
colonies only in English-built ships, or could
the colonists send their own ships for them?</p>

The writs to which he attributed so much
importance require explanation. A vessel laden
with dutiable goods ought to enter some established
port and manifest her cargo at the custom-house
for payment of duties. This the government
justly demands, and with it the fair trader
readily complies. Not so the illicit trader. Before
reaching port he may discharge a portion of
the cargo in some place remote from the custom-house;
or in a regular port, by connivance, he
may secrete a portion of it, and thus escape
paying duties. In either case the revenue officer
needs a search-warrant for such goods. If he
applies to the court, he must set forth a general
description of the goods concealed and the place
where, together with the names of witnesses.
This is recorded, and may be known to all parties
interested. The result is, that the informer subjects
himself to private animosity and public obloquy,
and the goods meanwhile may be removed
to some other place. This process may be repeated
indefinitely, with like results. What the
officer needs, therefore, is a general warrant, good
for an indefinite time, not returnable into the
court, and authorizing search of all suspected
places at all hours of the day, for any dutiable
goods supposed to be concealed. This is a Writ
of Assistance. Its formidable nature is readily
understood, and the objections to it are apparent.
It is like those General Warrants which made
a great noise in England in connection with
John Wilkes (Campbell's <i>Lord Chancellors</i>, v.
207, American ed.; <i>Parliamentary History, 1764</i>,
vol. xv. 1393). They are prohibited by the Bill
of Rights in the Massachusetts Constitution,
drafted by John Adams, as infringing the right
of the citizen to protect his house from unreasonable
search; and when the Constitution of
the United States, without a similar provision,
was submitted to the people, its absence was
noticed, and the omission supplied by the fourth
amendment. Such writs are now in force in
England (16 and 17 Vict., ch. 107, sec. 221), but
not in the United States.</p>

Horace Gray, Jr., sums up the whole matter
in the following paragraph: "A careful examination
of the subject compels the conclusion
that the decision of Hutchinson and his associates
has been too strongly condemned as illegal,
and that there was at least reasonable
ground for holding, as matter of mere law, that
the British Parliament had power to bind the
colonies that even a statute contrary to the
Constitution could not be declared void by the
judicial courts; that by the English statutes, as
practically construed by the courts in England,
Writs of Assistance might be general in form;
that the Superior Court of Judicature of the
province had the power of the English Court
of Exchequer; and that the Writs of Assistance
prayed for, though contrary to the spirit of the
English Constitution, could hardly be refused
by a provincial court, before general warrants
had been condemned in England, and before the
Revolution had actually begun in America. The
remedy adopted by the colonies was to throw off
the yoke of Parliament; to confer on the judiciary
the power to declare unconstitutional statutes
void; to declare general warrants unconstitutional
in express terms; and thus to put an end
here to general Writs of Assistance" (Quincy's
<i>Reports</i>, Appendix, 540).</p>

In 1763, when the Indians on the southern
frontiers were menacing, Gen. Gage required 750
men from Massachusetts to assist in a movement
against the Indians on the lakes. The
House declined nor would it yield even when
the Secretary of State urged compliance (Minot's
<i>History</i>, ii. 142). But while Massachusetts refused
the required assistance, Connecticut, though reluctantly,
granted it,&mdash;a fact of much significance

The expression is Governor Bernard's in
January, 1764 (Frothingham's <i>Rise of the Republic</i>,
123, note). The consequences of breaking
up the West India trade by the enforcement of
the navigation laws, and its influence upon the
minds of the commercial colonies, will more fully
appear in the following facts. The sugar colonies,
being cultivated by slaves, afforded an insufficient
market for English manufactures. Consequently,
the large ships which were needed to
bring off sugar and molasses were obliged to
proceed thither without profitable freight. But
the Northern colonies, and New England in particular,
could supply the islands with the commodities
they needed,&mdash;cattle, horses, lumber
for buildings, casks for sugar and molasses. A
cargo of these commodities sent to the islands
was exchanged for sugar and molasses, which
were brought to New England; or for bullion,
which, with a cargo of sugar, was carried to Old
England. The freight money and bullion were
exchanged for British merchandise, which was
brought to New England, thus making a profitable
double voyage. With her advantages
of position and of profitable freight, New England
also became the carrier of the sugar of the
French islands to Spain.</p>

<i>Hist. U. S.</i>, final revision, iii. 73. Two things
in the above summary require explanation. Merchandise
imported into England was subject to
heavy duties; but if it was reëxported to America,
then these duties, in whole or in part, were
repaid to the importer, and the result would be
that the colonists could purchase wines and
Continental goods cheaper than could be done
by British subjects at home. To equalize this
burden, and still to derive a revenue, these
drawbacks were reduced; and, of course, the
British Exchequer would gain the amount of this
reduction.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the Treaty of 1763, two small islands, St.
Pierre and Miquelon, on the south coast of Newfoundland,
were accorded to France for the convenience
of her fishing vessels. But they had
been made ports of an illicit trade with the American
colonies. Hence the prohibition of all trade
with them.</p>

7 Geo. III. ch. 46, <i>Ibid.</i>, 369. Bancroft's account
of these Acts is not quite accurate (<i>History</i>,
vi. 84, 85): "By another Act (7 Geo. III. ch.
xli.) a Board of Customs was established at Boston,
and general Writs of Assistance were legalized."
The execution of the Laws of Trade was
placed under the direction of Commissioners of
Customs, "to reside in the said Plantations",
where the king should direct,&mdash;not localized at
Boston. It was by ch. xlvi. sec. x., not xli., that
Writs of Assistance were legalized. But a more
serious error is in the statement that "Townshend's
revenue was to be disposed of under the
sign-manual at the king's pleasure. This part of
the system had no limit as to time or place, and
was intended as a perpetual menace." This is
far from being accurate. By section iv. it is
provided that the revenue arising from the act
should be applied, in the first place, "for the
charge of the administration of justice, and the
support of <i>civil government</i>" in the colonies;
and the residue was to be paid into the receipt
of the Exchequer, and entered separate and
apart from all other moneys, and reserved to be
disposed <i>by Parliament</i> for the defence of the
colonies. It was the civil administration alone
that could be paid by the king's warrant. The
expense of the army could be appropriated only
by Parliament; and the difference is worthy of
attention.</p>

It was reported at a town meeting held at
Boston on October 28, 1767, in which James
Otis presided, that Lynn, in the previous year,
had turned out forty thousand pairs of women's
shoes,&mdash;an industry which has since grown to
very large proportions,&mdash;and that another town
had made thirty thousand yards of cloth (Frothingham's
<i>Rise of the Republic</i>, 208).</p>

The circular letter was not adopted without
opposition. Bernard says that the proposition
was first rejected two to one; and after the
measure was finally carried, in order to give the
appearance of greater unanimity, the former proceedings
of dissent were obliterated from the
journal (<i>Letters</i>, 8).</p>

Gordon, i. 231. Governor Bernard has given
an account of these transactions in a series of letters
addressed to Shelburne or Hillsborough, and
published in a collected volume. It is a graphic
narrative, in many cases of events in which he
had participated, or which he had learned from
eye-witnesses. Apparently they are as fair as
other partisan accounts of the transactions, which
may be found in various histories. The truth yet
waits to be told; but it will not be accurately
told by one who assigns all sublimated virtues to
one party, and the most malignant depravity to
the other.</p>

Otis was chairman. On the first day several
committees were appointed: one to learn from
Governor Bernard the grounds of his apprehensions
that additional regiments were expected;
another to present a petition for convening the
General Court "with the utmost speed;" and a
third to take into consideration the state of public
affairs, and report salutary measures at an
adjourned meeting. The next day the governor
replied that his information in regard to the
troops was private: when he had public letters
on the subject he would communicate them to
the Council. As for calling another assembly,
he could do nothing without his majesty's commands.
Whereupon a series of resolutions and
votes was passed to the effect that the inhabitants
of Boston would defend the king, the charter,
and their own rights; that levying of money
within the province, or keeping a standing army,
except by consent of the General Assembly, was
in violation of the charter and of natural rights;
that the several towns be asked (the letter is
in Hutchinson, iii. 492) to send delegates to a
convention to be held on the 22d; that on account
of a "prevailing apprehension, in the
minds of many, of an approaching war with
France", the inhabitants be provided with arms;
and that the ministers in town set apart a day of
fasting and prayer. A broadside of these proceedings
was published, of which a fac-simile is
in the Boston Public Library.</p>

See Vol. V. p. 612. For more than a century
in the government of the colonies political
considerations were subordinated to a commercial
policy; New England was favored during
the Protectorate, and Virginia after the Restoration,
equally on political grounds. But with the
beginning of the French War this commercial
policy began to give way to an imperial policy.
To the Congress of 1754 is due the distinction
of being the only body, among similar gatherings
before or since, which of its own motion
seriously entertained and adopted a project of
bringing the colonies, as a unit, into defined relations
to the mother country, for general government
in respect to their defence. Nobody
saw more clearly than Franklin, or has more
explicitly pointed out the necessity of some general
government for the defence of the colonies
(<i>Works</i>, by Sparks, iii. 32 <i>et seq.</i>); and to secure
these ends he was willing to go further, in some
respects, even than Hutchinson. He admitted
the power and necessity of parliamentary action
in the alteration of colonial charters (<i>Works</i>, iii.
36). He provided that the President-General
should be appointed and his salary paid by the
crown (3 <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, v. 70); that the
Speaker should be approved by the President-General,
thus admitting the validity of the prerogative
(<i>Works</i>, iii. 44; and see Plan, that the
assent of the President-General should be requisite
to all <i>acts</i> of the Grand Council, instead of
all <i>laws</i>, as stated by Bancroft, iv. 123); and that
the Grand Council should have power to "lay
and levy such general duties, imposts, or taxes
as to <i>them</i> shall appear most equal and just"
(<i>Works</i>, iii. 50). Bancroft, in summarizing the
Plan of Union, drawn by Franklin, says (<i>Hist.</i>,
iv. 124) the general government was empowered
"to make laws and levy just and equitable
taxes", thus giving the impression that the powers
of the Council were limited by absolute justice
and equity, or by what each colony should
so judge. But this is what Franklin neither
meant nor said. He lodged the powers in the
sole discretion of the Council, which is quite a
different thing. Grenville or Townshend asked
no more for Parliament. The General Assembly
of Connecticut knew what the words meant.
In their reasons for rejecting the proposed
plan (I <i>Mass. Hist. Coll.</i>, vii. 212) they say,
"The proposal, in said plan contained, for the
President-General and Council to levy taxes,
&amp;c., <i>as they please</i>, throughout this extensive
government, is a very extraordinary thing, and
against <i>the rights and privileges of Englishmen</i>."
Their objections to Franklin's Plan read like an
answer of the Massachusetts General Court,
drawn by Samuel Adams, to a message of Bernard.
The governor and council of Rhode Island
had similar fears. They said that they found it
to be "a scheme which, if carried into execution,
will virtually deprive this government, at least,
of some of its most valuable privileges, if not
effectually overturn and destroy our present
happy constitution" (<i>Rhode Island Hist. Tracts</i>,
ix. 61). And that sturdy patriot, Stephen Hopkins,
who was associated with Franklin, Hutchinson,
Pitkin, and Howard in the Albany Plan, was
subjected to much worry for invoking the parliamentary
authority in modifying the Rhode Island
charter, and was driven to self-vindication in A
<i>True Representation</i> (<i>Ibid.</i>, I). Whatever modifications
Franklin's opinions may have undergone
in later years on other matters, "it was his
opinion thirty years afterwards that his plan was
near the true medium" (<i>Works</i>, iii. 24, Sparks's
note).</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is a plan of union in the handwriting of
Thomas Hutchinson (<i>Mass. Archives</i>, vi. 171,
and in the <i>Trumbull MSS.</i>, in Mass. Hist. Soc.,
i. 97; and printed in Frothingham's <i>Rise of the
Republic</i>, Appendix) which probably expressed
his sentiments in 1754, when it was rejected by
the General Court. Like Franklin, he was willing
to acknowledge and invoke the parliamentary
authority for the union, with the power in
the Grand Council to levy such taxes as they
deemed just and equal; but, unlike Franklin,
he did not allow the President to negative the
choice of the Speaker by the Grand Council.</p>
<p class="pfc4">But no one wrote from a more varied experience,
or more careful examination of colonial
constitutions, and of their possible relations to
the mother country, than Thomas Pownall. His
connection with the Commissioners of Trade
and Plantations, as their secretary in 1745, made
him familiar with the difficulties of colonial administration
from the British point of view; and
his successive administrations, as lieutenant-governor,
or governor, of New Jersey, Massachusetts,
and South Carolina from 1755 to 1761, extended
his acquaintance with the state of colonial affairs
in the Northern, Middle, and Southern colonies.
He was a moderate Whig, and, like all moderate
men in those days, his counsels were duly regarded
by neither party. He embodied his views
in a work entitled <i>The Administration of the Colonies</i>,
which passed through several editions. His
scheme was elaborate and wise, if his concurrence
with Franklin in points which they treat
in common may be regarded as a test of wisdom.
His commercial scheme was predicated on the
general law that colonial trade follows capital,
and, while sharing the benefits, pays profit to it.
He would have left that trade free to develop
itself within certain limits; but inasmuch as it
must tend somewhere,&mdash;to the English, French,
or Dutch,&mdash;he thought it right that the trade of
English colonies should pay profit to England,
as the country whose navy defended it, and by
whose capital it was developed. But England
ought to grasp this trade only as the centre of a
commercial dominion of which America was a
part and entitled to parliamentary representation,
which he thought practicable. In theory
he acknowledged the prerogative of the crown
in respect to colonial government, but recognized
the necessity of parliamentary intervention,
and would have reduced both to cases of
actual necessity, and would always have subordinated
the question of power to the dictates of
reason and expediency.</p>

What we know of this speech is derived mainly from the notes of it taken by John Adams (<i>Works</i>, ii.
521-525), and from the reminiscent account of it which Adams gave to William Tudor in 1818, with his description
of the scene in court during its delivery. Minot, in his <i>Hist. of Massachusetts</i>, 1748-1765 (vol. ii. 91-99),
worked up these notes, and they form the basis of the narrative in Tudor's <i>Life of Otis</i> (p. 62). The legal
aspects have been specially examined by Horace Gray in an appendix to the <i>Reports of Cases in the Superior
Court 1761-1772, by Josiah Quincy, Jr., printed from his original manuscripts, and edited by Samuel M.
Quincy</i> (Boston, 1865). Cf. <i>John Adams's Works</i>, x. pp. 182, 233, 244, 274, 314, 317, 338, 342, 362. Cf. also

Society. W. S. Johnson wrote to Governor Trumbull that the process was in vogue in England (<i>Trumbull
Papers</i>; <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, xlix. pp. 292, 374), as it is to-day. The most conspicuous instance of an
attempt to search under these writs was when the officers tried to enter the house of Daniel Malcom in Oct.,
1766, and were forcibly resisted. The papers connected with this, as transmitted to London, and telling the
story on both sides, are among the <i>Lee Papers</i> in Harvard College library (vol. i. nos. 14-25).</p>

authorship, for the tract was printed anonymously. Cf. Frothingham's <i>Rise of the Republic</i>, p. 172; Palfrey's
<i>New England</i> (Compend. ed.), iv. 369. Hopkins's tract was controverted in a <i>Letter from a gentleman at
Halifax</i> (Newport, 1765,&mdash;Sabin, x. 40,281); and James Otis replied in a <i>Vindication of the British Colonies
against the aspersions of the Halifax gentleman</i> (Boston, 1765; Carter-Brown, iii. no. 1,480); and this
in turn was followed by a <i>Defence of the Letter</i>, etc. (Newport, 1765), and <i>Brief Remarks</i> (Brinley, i. nos.

Mayhew had early sounded the alarm, and Thornton begins his <i>Pulpit of the Revolution</i> with a reprint of
Mayhew's sermon in 1750 on <i>Unlimited submission and non-resistance to the higher powers</i> (Boston, 1750;
again, 1818; Brinley, no. 1,529). The controversy with Apthorpe, who was settled over Christ Church in
Cambridge, as representative of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, began
with his <i>Considerations on the institution and conduct of the Society</i>, etc. (Boston, 1763), to which Mayhew
responded in his <i>Observations on the charter and conduct of the Society</i>, etc., <i>designed to show their
non-conformity to each other</i> (Boston, 1763; London, 1763; Stevens's <i>Hist. Coll.</i>, i. no. 383; Haven, p.
564). Dr. Caner, of King's Chapel, Boston, replied in <i>A Candid Examination of Dr. Mayhew's Observations</i>,
etc. (Boston, 1763). Another <i>Answer</i> (London, 1764) was perhaps by Apthorpe. Mayhew published
<i>A Defence of his Observations</i> (Boston, 1763), and a second defence, called <i>Remarks</i>, etc. (Boston, 1764;
London, 1765), which was followed by a <i>Review</i> by Apthorpe (London, 1765). These and other tracts of the
controversy are recorded in Stevens's <i>Hist. Coll.</i>, i. nos. 378-391; in Carter-Brown, iii. nos. 1,433, 1,465; in
Haven's list, pp. 562, 564, 565.</p>

and the sugar act passed, placing a duty on molasses, etc.,&mdash;a modification of the act of 1733. "I know not",

American independence." <i>John Adams's Works</i>, x. 345.</p>

<i>Ames's Almanac</i> for 1766 has this notice: "Price before the Stamp Act takes place, half-a-dollar per
dozen, and six coppers single; after the act takes place, more than double that price." The act was called,

and applying certain stamp duties, and other duties in the British colonies and plantations in America,
towards defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing the same</i> [etc.]. It was reprinted at
once in Boston, New London, New York, and Philadelphia, and will be found in the official records and in various
modern books like Spencer's <i>Hist. U. S.</i> (i. 274), etc. The stamps are found in various cabinets (<i>Catal.

Lecky, <i>England in the Eighteenth Cent.</i> (iii. 324). Mahon (v. 86) quotes Burke's speech of 1774 as proving
the small interest in the debate of 1765, and thinks that Walpole's failure to mention the debate in his
letters proves the truth of Burke's recollections. Adolphus had earlier relied on Burke. Mahon even intimates
that Barré's famous speech was an interpolation in the later accounts; but the <i>Letters</i> printed by Jared
Ingersoll show that it was delivered. (Cf. <i>Palfrey's Review of Mahon</i>.) The <i>Parliamentary History</i> says
that Barré's speech was in reply to Grenville; but Ingersoll says Charles Townshend was the speaker who provoked
it. Cf. Frothingham's <i>Rise of the Republic</i> (p. 175); Ryerson's <i>Loyalists</i> (i. 294); H. F. Elliot on
"Barré and his Times" in <i>Macmillan's Mag.</i>, xxxv. 109 (Dec., 1876); and <i>Hist. MSS. Com. Report</i>, viii.
pp. 189, 190.</p>
<p class="pfc4">It was in the speech of Feb. 6, 1765, that Barré applied the words "Sons of Liberty" to the patriots in
America, which they readily adopted (Bancroft, v. 240; Thornton's <i>Pulpit</i>, 131). Dr. J. H. Trumbull, in a
paper, "Sons of Liberty in 1755", published in the <i>New Englander</i>, vol. xxxv. (1876), showed that the term had
ten years earlier been applied in Connecticut to organizations to advance theological liberty. It is also sometimes
said that the popular party at the time of the Zenger trial had adopted the name. The new organization
embraced the young and ardent rather than the older and more prudent patriots, and at a later period
they became the prime abettors of the non-importation movements. For their correspondence in New England,
see <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> (x. 324) and the Belknap Papers (MSS., iii. p. 110, etc.) in the Mass. Hist.
Soc. cabinet. A list of those dining together in 1769 at Dorchester is given in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Aug.,
1869. The correspondence of those in Boston with John Wilkes, 1768-69, is noted in the <i>Brit. Mus. Catal.</i>,
Add. MSS. 30,870, ff. 45, 46, 75, 135, 222. H. B. Dawson's <i>Sons of Liberty in N. Y.</i> was privately printed in

Hutchinson had expressed disapproval of the Stamp Act; but doubting its expediency did not affect his
judgment of the necessity of enforcing it (P. O. Hutchinson, i. 577; ii. 58). On the destruction of his house,
see his own statement in P. O. Hutchinson's <i>Governor Hutchinson</i>, i. 70, 72, and his letter, dated Aug. 30,
1765, in the <i>Mass. Archives</i>, xxvi. 146, printed in the <i>Mass. Senate Docs.</i> (1870, no. 187, p. 3). He says:
"The lieutenant-governor, with his children, lodged the next night at the Castle, but after that in his house at
Milton, though not without apprehension of Danger." Quincy's diary (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, iv. 47) preserves
Hutchinson's speech, when a few days later he took his seat on the bench, clad with such clothing as
was left to him. Cf. the accounts in <i>Boston Newsletter</i>, Sept. 3, 1765; <i>Parliamentary History</i>, iv. 316; <i>Conduct

These papers are given in Hutchinson's <i>Mass. Bay</i> (iii. 467, 471, 476). Samuel Dexter was the head of

In recording the debates in Parliament, Bancroft (orig. ed., v. 383, 415) used the accounts in the <i>Political
Debates</i>, in Walpole's <i>Letters</i>, the <i>précis</i> in the French archives, the report set down by Moffat of Rhode
Island, and the copious extracts made by Garth, a member, who sent his notes to South Carolina. William
Strahan's account is given in the <i>Penna. Mag. of Hist.</i>, April, 1886, p. 95. It is said in P. O. Hutchinson's
<i>Governor Hutchinson</i> (i. 288) that Pitt was in doubt at first which side to take. Cf. lives of Pitt and editions
of his speeches, and the comment in Mahon, v. 133, 138, and Ryerson, i. 302. Smyth (ii. 365) considers the
protest of the lords against the repeal (<i>Protests of the Lords</i>, ed. by J. E. T. Rogers, ii. 77) the best exposition

<p class="pfc4">There were rumors of the coming repeal in Boston as early as April 1st (Thornton's <i>Pulpit</i>, 120), but the confirmation
came May 16th, when public rejoicing soon followed, and on a Thanksgiving, July 24, Charles Chauncy
delivered a <i>Discourse</i> in Boston (Boston, 1766; reprinted by Thornton, p. 105). The <i>Boon Catalogue</i> (no.
2,949) and others show numerous sermons in commemoration of the repeal; and the public prints give the
occasional ballads (F. Moore's <i>Songs and Ballads</i>, p. 22).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The town of Boston ordered portraits of Conway and Barré to be painted, and the pictures hung in Faneuil

There was a <i>History of Amer. Taxation from 1763</i>, published in a third ed. at Dublin in 1775 (Sabin,
vii. 32,125). Franklin contended that at this time taxation of the colonies was a popular idea in England
(<i>Works</i>, vii. 350), while Smyth found that at a later day (<i>Lectures</i>, ii. 371) he could get sympathy in speaking
of "the miserable, mortifying, melancholy facts of our dispute with America." See synopsis of the arguments
<i>pro et con</i> in <i>Life of George Read</i>, 76; Palfrey, iv. 327; Smyth's <i>Lectures</i>, ii. 471; Green's <i>Hist. View</i>,
55; Gardiner and Mullinger's <i>Eng. Hist. for Students</i> (N. Y., 1881), p. 183. Cf. also Bigelow's <i>Franklin</i>, i.
515; Foster's <i>Stephen Hopkins</i>, ii. 244.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A few of the most indicative tracts on the subject may be mentioned:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">Soame Jenyns's <i>Objections to the Taxation of our American Colonies briefly considered</i> (London, 1765;
also in his <i>Works</i>, 1790, vol. ii. p. 189), which was answered in James Otis's <i>Considerations on behalf of the
British Colonies</i>, dated Boston, Sept. 4, 1765 (Boston and London, 1765).</p>
<p class="pfc4">George Grenville is credited with the authorship of <i>The Regulations lately made concerning the Colonies
and the taxes imposed upon them considered</i> (London, 1765,&mdash;Carter-Brown, iii. no. 1,472; <i>Sparks Catal.</i>,
p. 83).</p>
<p class="pfc4">William Knox, the agent of Georgia, printed <i>The Claim of the Colonies to exemption from internal taxes
imposed by authority of Parliament examined</i> (Lond., 1765). The <i>Brinley Catal.</i>, no. 3,218, shows Franklin's
copy, with his annotations.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Daniel Dulaney's <i>Considerations on the propriety of imposing taxes in the British Colonies for the purpose
of raising a revenue by Act of Parliament</i> (North America, 1765; Annapolis, 1765; New York, 1765;
London, 1766) is in most copies without the author's name. (Cf. Sabin, v. no. 21,170; Carter-Brown, iii. nos.
1,438-39, 1,503; Brinley, i. no. 188; also Frothingham's <i>Rise of the Repub.</i>, p. 194, and <i>Chatham Correspondence</i>,
iii. 192.)</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>The late regulations respecting the British colonies in America considered in a letter from a gentleman
in Philadelphia to his friend in London</i> (Philad., 1765; Lond., 1765) is usually said to have been by John
Dickinson. It is included in his <i>Political Writings</i>, vol. i. A brief tract of two pages, <i>A denunciation of
the Stamp Act</i> (Philad., 1765), is also said to be Dickinson's.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The right of Parliament is sustained, but the Stamp Act as a measure condemned, in <i>A letter to a member
of Parliament wherein the power of the British legislature and the case of the colonists are briefly and impartially
considered</i> (London, 1765,&mdash;Sabin, x. 40,406; Carter-Brown, iii. 1,462).</p>

The first is a <i>Letter from a merchant in London to his nephew in No. America relative to the present
posture of affairs in the Colonies</i> (Lond., 1766), and the last <i>A series of answers to certain popular objections
against separating from the rebellious colonies and discarding them entirely: being the concluding
tract of the Dean of Gloucester on the subject of American affairs</i> (Gloucester, 1776). The dean's plan of
separation is best unfolded, however, in his <i>Humble Address and Ernest appeal</i> (London, 1775; 3rd ed., corrected,
1776). The views of Tucker are given synoptically by Smyth (<i>Lectures</i>, ii. 392), Lecky (iii. 421), Hildreth
(iii. 58). If Haven's list is correct, only two of Tucker's tracts were reprinted in the colonies. Cf.
<i>Menzies Catal.</i>, no. 1,997. The letters of Franklin and Wm. S. Johnson reflect opinions in England at
this time.</p>

Published in London in 1767, two editions; Boston, 1767; also in Almon's <i>Tracts</i>, vol. iii. Cf. Sabin,
iv. nos. 15,202-3; Brinley, iii. p. 185; Carter-Brown, iii., no. 1,498. 18 It is sometimes attributed to C. Jenkinson.
The published tracts of 1766 are enumerated in Carter-Brown and Haven under 1766; in Cooke, 1,336, 1,929,
1,934; in Brinley, i. p. 21; ii. p. 154; and in Sabin, under the authors' names.</p>
<p class="pfc4">During 1767 also there was something of a flurry in the religious part of the community induced by a sermon
(London, 1767) which the Bishop of Landaff had preached before the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel in Foreign Parts, in Feb., in which he had styled the Americans "infidels and barbarians." William
Livingston, of New York, addressed a <i>Letter to the Bishop</i> (London, 1768), and Charles Chauncy, of Boston,
published a <i>Letter to a friend</i> (Boston, 1767), in which the bishop was taken to task, while an anonymous
friend undertook a <i>Vindication of the Bishop</i> (New York, 1768). Cf. Carter-Brown, iii. nos. 1,585, 1,629, 1,630.</p>

For the movements in Boston, see Frothingham's "Sam. Adams's Regiments" in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>,
June and Aug., 1867, and Nov., 1863. The letter of the town to Dennis Deberdt, the London agent, sets
forth their side of the case (<i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 29). John Mein, the Boston printer, one of the proscribed,
published his <i>State of the importation of Great Britain with the port of Boston from Jan. to Aug., 1768</i>, to
show that his assailants were also importers (Stevens's <i>Hist. Coll.</i>, i. no. 393; Quaritch, 1885, no. 29,618).
There is one of the agreements among the Boston merchants, Aug. 14, 1769, in <i>Misc. MSS.</i>, 1632-1795, in
Mass. Hist. Soc. cabinet. Samuel Cooper tells Franklin how the agreements are adhered to (Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>,
vii. 448). Moore, <i>Songs and Ballads of the Rev.</i>, p. 48, gives some verses from the <i>Boston Newsletter</i>,
urging the "daughters of liberty" to lend their influence in this direction. In the early part of 1770 the
movement seemed to be vigorous (<i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 150; cf. papers of Cushing, Hancock, and others, in
<i>Letters and Papers</i>, 1761-1776, in Mass. Hist Soc. cabinet). Late in the year Hutchinson could write:
"The confederacy in all the governments against importing seemed in the latter end of the summer to be
breaking to pieces" (P. O. Hutchinson, i. 24). For such matters in Philadelphia, see Scharf and Westcott's
<i>Philadelphia</i>; Franklin (Sparks), vii. 445; (Bigelow), ii. 39. In Delaware, see <i>Life of George Read</i>, 82. In
Charlestown (S. C.) there was a controversy over the non-importation association, in which Christopher
Gadsden and John Mackenzie supported the movement, and W. H. Drayton and William Wragg opposed
it. These letters, which appeared in Timothy's <i>S. C. Gazette</i>, June-Dec., 1769, were issued together in <i>The
letters of Freeman</i>, etc. ([London], 1771, Brinley, no. 3,976).</p>

Hutchinson's side of the story is in his <i>History</i>, iii. 189. At a large town meeting, over which Otis presided,
and at which no direct reference was made to the riots, the people recapitulated grievances, and petitioned
(<i>Rec. Com. Rept.</i>, xvi. 254) the governor to order the "Romney" away from the harbor. Hutchinson
(iii. App. J and K) prints the address and the instructions which were given to their representatives. (Cf. <i>John
Adams's Works</i>, iii. 501.) The examination of Robert Hallowell, controller of the port, is in the <i>Lee MSS.</i>
(H. C. library), i. no. 40.. Johnson (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, xlix. 301) speaks of the effect in England. See
the general historians, and also special reports in <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1868, p. 402; 1869, p. 452;

<i>Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania to the inhabitants of the British Colonies</i> (Philad., Boston, New
York, 1768). They originally appeared in twelve numbers in the <i>Penna. Chronicle and Universal Advertiser</i>,
between Dec. 2, 1767, and Feb. 15, 1768. When reprinted in London (1768) Franklin added a preface,
and they were again printed there in 1774. (Cf. Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, i. 316; iv. 256; vii. 391, x. 433; Bigelow's
<i>Franklin</i>, i. 566; Sabin, v. nos. 20,044-20,052; Haven, p. 594; Carter-Brown, iii. 1,620, 1,621.) They are
included in Dickinson's <i>Political Writings</i> (Wilmington, 1801, vol. ii.). Lecky (iii. 419) calls these letters
"one of the ablest statements of the American case." Cf. Frothingham's <i>Rise of the Republic</i>, p. 208, and
Shea's <i>Hamilton</i>, p. 255. For Boston's letter of gratitude to Dickinson, see <i>Record Com. Rept.</i>, xvi. p. 243.
Lecky (iii. 320, 348) thinks the ablest presentation of the case against the colonies is <i>The Controversy between
Great Britain and her Colonies</i> (London, 1769; Boston, 1769), written to offset the <i>Farmer's Letters</i>. Bancroft
says that Grenville himself wrote the constitutional argument in it, and the Board of Trade furnished
the material. The pamphlet itself is usually ascribed to William Knox, the Under-Secretary of State, though
the names of Whately, Israel Mauduit, and John Mein have been sometimes preferred. (Cf. Carter-Brown,
iii. no. 1,666; Sabin, x. p. 532.)</p>

corresponding with William Livingston (Sedgwick's <i>Livingston</i>, pp. 136-138). Bernard was writing to Hillsborough,
Nov. 30, 1768, that "Bowdoin had
all along taken the lead in the Council in their
late extraordinary proceedings" (<i>Mass. Hist.

signature, which begins, "Being in the gallery a few days before the Assembly was dissolved, I heard Mr. Otis
make a long speech, part of the substance of which was, as near as I can remember, couched in the following
terms", etc.; and (<i>Ibid.</i>, vol. iii.) there is the affidavit of Richard Sylvester, a Boston innholder, sworn to before

115, 120; <i>Papers</i> pub. by the Seventy-Six Soc.; Lee MSS. in Harvard College library, i. nos. 42-45).
Bernard ascribed all his tribulations to his enforcement of the laws of trade (Bernard Papers in <i>Sparks MSS.</i>,
iii. 150). For Bernard's character, see <i>John Adams</i>, iv. 21, Mahon, v. 235, and Palfrey in his review of
Mahon. Bernard left Boston Aug. 2, 1769.</p>

The general belief is that the author of this defence was Samuel Adams (Wells, i. 282; Bancroft, vi. 312),
though it has been ascribed to William Cooper, to James Otis, and to Otis and Adams combined. Cf. Barry's

The notes include comments on the <i>Protest of the Lords against the repeal of the Stamp Act</i> (<i>Franklin</i>,
iv. 206); on <i>A letter from a merchant in London</i> (iv. 211); on <i>Good Humour, or a way with the Colonies</i>
(iv. 215); on <i>An inquiry into the nature and causes of the present disputes</i> (iv. 281); on <i>The true
constitutional means of putting an end to the disputes</i> (iv. 298). On Franklin in London at this time, see
Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, vii. 338, 350, 354, etc. The tracts above noted are said by Sparks to be in the Philadelphia
Athenæum, but some of these titles appear, as having Franklin's notes, in the <i>Brinley Catal.</i>  ii. nos.
3,218-22. Israel Mauduit's <i>Short View of the Hist. of the Colony of Mass. Bay</i> (Lond., 1769) is noted in

Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, iv. 258. Some letters of Strahan (1767-8, etc.) are in the <i>Penna. Mag. of Hist.</i>, x.
322. The letters of Wm. Samuel Johnson are also of importance (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, xlix.). He describes
Barré and others in debate. Barré, in March, 1769, predicted the loss of the colonies (Smyth, <i>Lectures</i>, ii.
384), and in April Johnson is writing, "It seems pretty probable that we shall go on contending, and fretting
each other, till we <i>become</i> separate and <i>independent</i> empires" (Beardsley's <i>Life of W. S. Johnson</i>, p. 65; also
see pp. 38, 42).</p>

A fac-simile of the <i>Mass. Spy</i>, March 7, 1771, with its blackened columns, is given in the <i>Mem. Hist. of
Boston</i> (iii. 135). On the same day Revere showed illuminated pictures of the scene from his house in North
Square. The orations were gathered and published collectively by Peter Edes in 1785, and this book appeared
in a second edition in 1807. The successive speakers were Thomas Young, James Lovell, Benjamin
Church (third ed. was corrected by the author), John Hancock, Joseph Warren (two editions), Peter Thacher,
Benj. Hichborn, Jonathan W. Austin, William Tudor, Jonathan Mason, Thomas Dawes, Geo. R. Minot, and
Thomas Welsh. These orations were published separately, and Hancock's is said by Wells (ii. 138) to have
been largely written by Samuel Adams. Hancock's was reprinted in New Haven. Some of them are in
Niles's <i>Principles and Acts</i> (1876), p. 17; and Loring (<i>Hundred Boston Orators</i>) particularly commemorates
them.</p>
<p class="pfc4">When Warren's oration in 1772 was published, a poem by James Allen (1739-1808) was to have accompanied
it, but some of the committee, having doubts of Allen's sentiments, suppressed it, when the poet's friends
later published it separately as <i>The poem which the town of Boston had voted unanimously to be published
with the late oration; with observations relating thereto; together with some very pertinent extracts from
an ingenious composition never yet published</i> [Anon.] (Boston, 1772). Cf. <i>Brinley Catal.</i>, iv. no. 6,771;
J. C. Stockbridge's <i>Harris Coll. of Amer. Poetry</i> (Providence, 1886), p. 8.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The oration of Thacher, delivered at Watertown during the siege of Boston, is said to be rarest of all the
separate issues (Cooke, no. 2,428).</p>
<p class="pfc4">A sermon on the massacre, by the Rev. John Lathrop, of the Second Church in Boston, "preached the lord's
day following", was first printed in London, 1770, and reprinted in Boston, 1771 (Carter-Brown, iii. 1,792;

them which largely concern Hutchinson's removing the Assembly to Cambridge (pp. 515-542).</p>
<p class="pfc4">In June, 1770, it would seem that Hutchinson's life was threatened because of the passions aroused by the
massacre, and there is in the Mass. Hist. Soc. library (<i>Misc. MSS.</i>, 1632-1795) a brief note of his written on
being advised to protect himself, dated June 22, 1770, at Milton. It is printed in the Society's <i>Proceedings</i>,

Sam. Adams seems to have drafted this reply, with aid on law-points from John Adams, the latter being
almost the exclusive author of the reply of the House to the second speech of the governor. Wells thinks
Hawley may have had a hand in these papers. Cf. Quincy's <i>Quincy</i>, p. 113; <i>Life, etc., of John Adams</i>, i.
118-133, ii. 310; Wells's <i>Sam. Adams</i>, ii. 29, 31, 41; Tudor's <i>Otis</i>, p. 410; Bradford's <i>Mass. State Papers</i>,

with the answers of his Majesty's Council and the House of Representatives</i> (Boston, 1773). A meeting
of the town of Boston was held in Faneuil Hall, March 8, 1773, "to vindicate the town from the gross
misrepresentations of his Excellency's message to both Houses", and its proceedings were circulated in broadside.</p>

British Bostonian</i> (Boston, 1773,&mdash;Stevens's <i>Nuggets</i>, no. 3,257). Joseph Reed was writing to Dartmouth
on the condition of affairs (Reed's <i>Reed</i>, i. ch. 2); and as respects the feelings farther south, see Gov. Wright's
letters from Georgia to Dartmouth, in the <i>Georgia Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, vol. iii.</p>

Pownall (b. 1722; d. 1805), who knew America well from residence and official station, proved a man of
great forecast, and a prudent, conciliatory friend of both countries. We have his speech in Parliament in
1769 (Haven in Thomas, ii. 604, 649), and know how impatient Parliament was of his wisdom (Smyth, <i>Lectures
on Mod. Hist.</i>, Bohn's ed., ii. 384-85). We see his admirable spirit in his correspondence (1772) with
James Bowdoin (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, v. 238).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Pownall had first published his <i>Administration of the Colonies</i> (London, 1764) at the very outset of the dispute,
and it was enlarged in 1765. In an appendix to the edition of 1766 he made a strong statement of his
views in opposition to the right of Parliament to tax America, and he reprinted this in a fourth ed. (1768), and
also issued it separately. In the fifth edition (1774) he added a second part, giving his plan of pacification.
The last edition was in 1777 (Sabin, xv. nos. 64,841, etc.; Carter-Brown, iii. nos. 1,425, 1,470, 1,537, 1,636). In
1780 Pownall published a tract that has acquired some fame, as a forecast of the future republic (Harper's
<i>Cyclo. of U. S. Hist.</i>, ii. 1,151), entitled <i>A Memorial to the Sovereigns of Europe on the present state of
affairs between the old and new world</i> (London, 1780). Somebody undertook what was rather fancifully
called <i>A Translation</i> of this tract into plainer language (London, 1781,&mdash;<i>Brinley Catal.</i>, no. 4,109), but it
did not meet with Pownall's approval. In 1783 he published a <i>Memorial addressed to the sovereigns of America</i>
(Lond., 1783,&mdash;Sabin, xv. nos. 64,824, etc.). On his tracts, see Shea's <i>Hamilton</i>, p. 261. There is a portrait
of Pownall at Earl Orford's in Norfolk (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Nov., 1875), and an engraving of it published
in 1777, of which there is a reproduction in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Nov., 1886, with an account of
the governor by Robert Ludlow Fowler. The painting in the gallery of the Mass. Hist. Soc. is said to have
been painted from this engraving. Cf. <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, ii. 63.</p>

We have full reports of the Boston meetings. The newspapers give us the accounts of the earlier irregular
conferences, and the town printed the reports of the first regular town meetings in <i>The votes and proceedings
of the freeholders and other inhabitants of the town of Boston, in town meeting assembled, according
to law, the 5th and 18th days of Nov., 1773</i> (Boston, 1773). It was reprinted in London by Franklin,
with a preface. The call of the committee for the later meetings exists in Mr. Bancroft's collection, in the
handwriting of Joseph Warren (Frothingham's <i>Warren</i>, 255), and was circulated in broadside. The reports
of the meetings of Nov. 29th and 30th exist in the original minutes in the handwriting of William Cooper
among the papers in the Charity Building in Boston, and have been printed by Dr. Green in the <i>Mass. Hist.
Soc. Proc.</i> (xx. 10, etc.). The prepared record was printed in a broadside dated Dec. 1, 1773, and a copy is
preserved in the Boston Public Library. It represents the meeting as called "for consulting, advising, and
determining upon the most proper and effectual method to prevent the unloading, receiving, or vending the
detestable tea sent out by the East India Company, part of which has just arrived in this harbor." Hutchinson
wrote from Milton, Nov. 30, to his son, one of the consignees of the tea, who had taken refuge in the
Castle, that the proclamation, warning the meeting to dissolve, which he had just sent into Boston, might
"possibly cause [him] to take [his] lodging at the Castle also" (P. O. Hutchinson, i. 94). The full report of
these meetings was also printed in the Boston newspapers, and particularly in the <i>Boston Gazette</i> of Dec.
6th, whose report was reprinted in one of <i>Poole's Mass. Registers</i>, and in the <i>Boston Journal</i>, Dec. 15, 1849.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Of the meeting of Dec. 16, 1773, and the raid of the "Mohawks" upon the tea-ships, an account was
printed in the <i>Boston Gazette</i> of Dec. 20th (Buckingham's <i>Reminiscences</i>, i. 169), and in the <i>Boston Evening
Post</i> of Dec. 20th (<i>Bay State Monthly</i>, April, 1884, p. 261), and the spread of these accounts as they were
copied through the country can be followed in the postscript of the <i>Penna. Gazette</i> of Dec. 24th. The speech
of Josiah Quincy, Jr., at the meeting, as reported by himself and sent back to his wife after he had reached
England, is the only harangue of this critical stage of the controversy in Boston of which we have any detailed
account (<i>Life of Quincy</i>, 2d ed., 124; Frothingham's <i>Warren</i>, 39; <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Dec. 16, 1873).
The conclave which planned the raid was held in Court Street (Drake's <i>Old Landmarks of Boston</i>, 81; <i>Mass.
Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Dec., 1871, for an account of the punch-bowl around which the conclave was held). There
are a number of contemporary journals and statements respecting these riotous proceedings. The letter of
the Mass. Ho. of Rep. to Franklin, Dec. 21, is preserved in the Lee MSS. (Harvard College library, vol. ii. no.
14), and is printed in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i> (xxxiv. 377). There are details in the Andrews letters (<i>Mass.
Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, viii. 325), in Newell's diary (<i>Ibid.</i>, Oct., 1877), in the Jolley narrative (<i>Ibid.</i>, Feb., 1878, p. 69),
in John Adams's diary (<i>Ibid.</i>, Dec., 1873, and his letter, Dec. 17, to James Warren, in <i>Works</i>, ix. 333). A
copy of the testimony of Dr. Hugh Williamson before the Privy Council, Feb. 19, 1774, copied from his own
draft, and relating the destruction of the tea, was transcribed from the original in 1827, while in the possession
of Dr. Hosack, and is included in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (lii. vol. iii.). Cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, xxxiv. 373, etc.</p>
<p class="pfc4">All this and other documentary evidence can be found in Force; in Niles's <i>Principles and Acts</i> (1876),
p. 96; in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Dec. 16, 1873; and in Francis S. Drake's <i>Tea Leaves: being a collection
of letters and documents relating to the shipment of tea to the American colonies in the year 1773, by the East
India tea company. Now first printed from the original manuscript. With an introduction, notes, and
biographical notices of the Boston tea party</i> (Boston, 1884). The only considerable narrative of an actor
in the "Mohawk" raid is G. R. T. Hewes's <i>Traits of the Tea Party</i> (N. Y., 1835), which was written out for
him by B. B. Thacher. Cf. also <i>Retrospect of the Boston Tea Party, with a memoir of Hewes</i> (N. Y., 1834);
Loring's <i>Hundred Boston Orators</i> (p. 554). The last survivor was Capt. Henry Purkitt, who died March 3,
1846. A picture of David Kinnison, also called the last survivor, is in Lossing's <i>Field-Book of the Revolution</i>
(i. 499). Of Samuel Phillips Savage, the moderator of the meeting of Dec. 16th, there is a portrait owned by
Mr. G. H. Emery, engraved in Drake's <i>Tea-leaves</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Hutchinson gives his view of the transactions in the third volume (pp. 422-441) of his <i>Massachusetts</i>. (Cf.
Ryerson's <i>Loyalists</i>, i. 383.) There is among the Bernard Papers (vol. viii. p. 229), in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>, a
paper giving the story as those in authority transmitted it to the home government.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Among the later American sources, see Frothingham's <i>Warren</i> (ch. 9), his <i>Rise of The Republic</i> (ch. 8), and

<p class="pfc4">The first accounts of the destruction of the tea which reached London (Jan. 19, 1774) were printed in the
London newspapers of Jan. 21st and in the <i>Gentleman's Mag.</i> (1774, p. 26), copied in Carlyle's <i>Frederick the

Century</i> (iii. p. 371), speaks of the speech of George Grenville, reported by Cavendish, as particularly worthy
of attention. Cf. <i>Parliamentary History</i> and Force's <i>Amer. Archives</i> (4th ser., i. 133).</p>

also J. H. Trumbull's <i>Blue Laws true and false</i>. Dawson (<i>Westchester County</i>, p. 7) claims that the
refusal of the New York authorities to allow the tea ship Nancy to enter the harbor was more significant
than the riot in Boston, and he cites various authorities. Cf. Lossing's <i>Schuyler</i> (i. ch. 16) and Leake's <i>Lamb</i>

Mahon (v. 323) thinks it strange that any American of high standing should care to justify or palliate the
conduct of Franklin. Goldwin Smith (<i>Study of History</i>, N. Y., 1866, p. 213) says: "Franklin alone, perhaps,
of the leading Americans, by the dishonorable publication of an exasperating correspondence, which he had
improperly obtained, shared with Grenville, Townshend, and Lord North the guilt of bringing this great disaster
on the English race." Lecky (<i>England in the Eighteenth Century</i>, iii. 380, 416) alleges rather hastily
that Hutchinson had once been concerned in using Franklin's letters with a certain disregard of rights.
(Cf. Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, iv. 450.) Some memoranda of Chalmers are in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (x. vol. iv.) Cf.

An account of it is given in Israel Mauduit's edition of <i>The letters of Gov. Hutchinson</i>, etc. (London,
1774), with an abstract of Wedderburn's speech. There is a description of this scene in Bowring's <i>Memoir
of Jeremy Bentham</i> (p. 59; cf. <i>Monthly Mag.</i>, Nov. 10, 1802, and Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, iv. 451). Gage wrote
from London to Hutchinson, Feb. 2, 1774, that no man's conduct was ever so abused for so vile a transaction
as Franklin's. There is a letter of Burke on the hearing (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, xlix. ii.). There is a contemporary
double-folio print, <i>Proceedings of his majesty's Privy Council on the address of the Assembly of Mass. Bay
to remove the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, with the substance of Mr. Wedderburn's speech</i> (Mass.
Hist. Soc.). The whole proceedings are given in <i>Franklin before the Privy Council in behalf of the Province
of Mass. Bay, to advocate the removal of Hutchinson and Oliver</i> (Philad., privately printed, 1859).
Arthur Lee has a word to say on the scene (<i>Life of A. Lee</i>, i. 240, 273). Franklin is said to have worn a suit
of Manchester velvet during this castigation from Wedderburn, which he did not put on again till he signed
the treaty of alliance with France in 1778 (Mahon, v. 328).</p>

In 1772 the town of Boston had sent a printed circular to the neighboring towns, asking their advice as
to the course best to be pursued in consequence of the crown's assuming to regulate the judges' salaries.
Hutchinson (<i>History</i>, iii. 545, 546) gives the report of the committee of the Assembly on the grant of the governor's
salary from the crown, and the governor's answer (July, 1772). For John Adams's controversy with
Brattle on this point, see <i>Adams's Works</i>, iii. 513. On Oliver's impeachment, see Hutchinson (iii. 443, 445),

There are in the Boston Archives sundry record-books of this time: list of donations; records of Donation
Committee; list of persons aided; cash-book of the Donation Committee. The House of Representatives
at Salem, June 18, 1774, passed resolutions commending Boston to the aid of all, and sent these resolutions
through the country in broadsides. The provincial congress at Cambridge, Dec. 6, 1774, recorded their
vote and similarly scattered it. (Cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiii. 182.) For the gifts which came to Boston,

The covenant was printed in the <i>Mass. Gazette</i>,
June 23, 1774, and is reprinted in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i> (xii. 45), where is also (<i>Ibid.</i>, xi. 392; also see
xii. 46) the protest against the covenant, and the loyalist
signers of the protest (given in <i>Mass. Gazette</i>, July
7, 1774). This drew out a proclamation from Gage,
pointing out the error of illegal combinations (<i>Mass.
Gazette</i>, June 30, 1774, and <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
xii. 47). It was turned into verse in ridicule (Moore's
<i>Songs and Ballads of the Rev.</i>, p. 65). Dr. Belknap
gave his reasons for not entering such a combination
(<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, 2nd ser., ii. 484). Cf. Frothingham's
<i>Rise of the Republic</i>, 336. Timothy Ruggles
soon organized a counter-association of loyalists.</p>

There are in the Mass. Hist. Soc. cabinet two
early, apparently official copies of the act for regulating
the government. Cf. Ramsay's <i>Revolution in
South Carolina</i> (i. 204); Frothingham's <i>Rise of the
Republic</i>, p.347, where are various references. Hutchinson
wrote from London that he was opposed to
these acts (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Jan., 1862, p. 301).
A letter from Jos. Wood, in London, April 18, 1774,
makes note of the efforts of the Americans in London
to prevent Parliament committing itself so hastily to
the Regulating Act (<i>Penna. Mag. of Hist.</i>, x. 265).
Something of the spirit of these protests can be seen
in Bishop Shipley's <i>Speech intended to have been
spoken on the bill for altering the charters of the
colony of Massachusetts Bay</i> (London, 1774). Cf. in
reply <i>A speech never intended to be spoken in answer
to a speech intended</i>, etc. (London, 1774). Cf.,
on Shipley, <i>Franklin's Works</i>, viii. 40. The bishop's
views are also expressed in his <i>Sermon before the Soc.
for the propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts</i>
(London, 1773; Norwich, Conn., 1773). There is a
portrait of Shipley in the <i>European Mag.</i>, April,
1788.</p>

that New York held back. Dawson (<i>Westchester</i>, 9) thinks that ignorance or neglect is at the bottom of the
usual view of the New York sluggishness, held to by writers, but he admits that Gouverneur Morris was
doubtful for a while (p. 12; cf. Sparks's <i>Life of Morris</i>); he sets forth the great ability of the Tory organ,

Seabury, the "Westchester Farmer", by Isaac Sears (pp. 127, 136; and on Sears, Jones, ii. 337, 622). Much

<i>Works</i>, viii. 131, 142. The Congress had been variously constituted. New York and Pennsylvania had
acted outside their legislatures. John Adams, in going through those States on his way to Philadelphia, had
remarked "that some in them wanted a little animation." The spirit in New York is shown on the loyal side
in Jones's <i>New York during the Rev.</i>, i. 449. Cf. J. A. Stevens on "New York in the Continental Congress"
in <i>The Galaxy</i>, xxii. 149. The credentials of the Delaware members are in the <i>Life of Geo. Read</i>, 91. The
Virginia delegates were at variance. Patrick Henry was eager for a fight. R. H. Lee thought Great Britain
would revoke her obnoxious legislature. Washington was undecided. The instructions of the Virginia delegates
are in <i>Jefferson's Writings</i>, i. 122. Gadsden was for forcing the conflict by attacking Gage in Boston;
and a rumor reaching Philadelphia that Boston was undergoing bombardment fanned the flame, and Samuel
Adams wrote home that America would stand by the devoted town. In Georgia the royal governor had prevented
the choice of delegates, and that province was not represented. The opposing feelings, North and
South, can be gathered from some of the tracts Which the Congress elicited:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>A few remarks upon some of the resolutions and votes of the Continental Congress at Philad. in Sept.,
and the Provincial Congress at Cambridge in November, by a friend to Peace and Good order</i> (Boston,
1775; same, no date,&mdash;Sabin, iv. 15,529). <i>The two Congresses cut up</i> (Boston and New York,&mdash;Sabin, iv.
15,597). Thomas Jefferson's <i>Summary View of the rights of British America, set forth in some resolutions,
intended for the inspection of the delegates now in convention</i> (Williamsburg, 1774; Philad., 1774). <i>A letter
from a Virginian to the members of the Congress to be held at Philadelphia, Sept., 1774</i> (without place,
1774; Boston, 1774, in three editions; London, 1774),&mdash;in opposition to the non-importation combination.
<i>Address to the deputies in General Congress</i> (Aug. 10, 1774, Charlestown, S. C.,&mdash;Sabin, v. 15,511). <i>Letter
from a freeman of South Carolina to the deputies of North America, assembled in High Court of Congress
at Philadelphia</i> (Charlestown, S. C., 1774,&mdash;Sabin, x. 40,277).</p>

The plan was published in Philadelphia at the time, and was included the next year in Galloway's <i>Candid
examination of the mutual claims of Great Britain and the colonies, with a plan of accommodation on
Constitutional principles</i> (New York, 1775, and again in 1780). This drew out <i>An Address to the Author
of a pamphlet entitled</i>, etc., to which Galloway responded in <i>A Reply</i> (N. Y., 1775). It was later included in
Galloway's <i>Historical and political Reflections on the Rise and Progress of the Amer. Rebellion</i> (London,
1780). Cf. Force, 4th ser., i. p. 1; Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, vii. 276, viii. 145; Bigelow's <i>Franklin</i>, ii. 249; Gordon,

<p class="pfc4">Jones, in his <i>New York during the Rev.</i>, i. ch. 2, with notes on pp. 438, 449, 477, 490, explains the relations
of the loyalists to this Congress. Governor Franklin sent the Galloway plan to Dartmouth with comments
(<i>N. J. Archives</i>, x. 503).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Galloway explains his relations to this Congress, and divulged more than the agreement of secrecy was held
to warrant, in his <i>Examination before the House of Commons in a committee on the American Papers</i> (London,
1779; 2d ed., with explanatory notes, 1780; ed. by Thomas Balch, Philad., for the Seventy-Six Society,
1855). There is a Dutch version, 1781 (Muller, 1877, no. 1,200). Respecting this examination, Lecky (ii.
pp. 443, 481, etc.) says: "As a loyalist, Galloway's mind was no doubt biased; but he was a very able and
honest man, and he had much more than common means of forming a correct judgment."</p>
<p class="pfc4">It has been supposed that Galloway conveyed to Governor Franklin the information which through that official
reached Dartmouth (<i>N. Jersey Archives</i>, x. 473). Galloway is said also to have prepared the pamphlet
<i>Arguments on both sides in the dispute</i>, etc., which is also reprinted in the <i>N. J. Archives</i>, x. 478. On Galloway,
see Sabine's <i>Loyalists</i>, i. 453.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Haven ascribes to Thomas B. Chandler, and Sabin (no. 16,591) to Dr. Myles Cooper, a tract, <i>What think ye
of Congress now? Or an Enquiry how far the Americans are bound to abide by and execute the decisions of
the late Continental Congress, with a plan by Samuel</i> [sic] <i>Galloway, Esq., for a proposed union between
Great Britain and her Colonies</i> (N. Y., 1775; Lond., 1775). This pamphlet accuses the New England republicans
of urging the Congress beyond the purpose for which its members were elected.</p>

is in the Penna. Hist. Soc. library. Frothingham gives the best account of the genesis of the document
and the effect it had (<i>Rise of the Republic</i>, 373, 396). In Massachusetts, a broadside Resolution of the Provincial
Congress, signed by Hancock, Dec. 6th, was sent to all the ministers, urging them to give their influence
to secure a general compliance (in Boston Pub. Lib., H. 90 <i>a</i>, 3). This plan of association was opposed by Galloway,
Duane, and all the South Carolina delegates except Gadsden. Jones (<i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i>, i. 438)
gives the loyalist view. <i>The association of the delegates, etc., by Bob Jinger</i>, is a burlesque on the association
(<i>Harris Collection of Amer. Poetry</i>, p. 13).</p>

than some of the colonies do (Sabin, ix. no. 36,297). <i>A Letter to Lord Chatham on the Quebec Bill</i> reached
five editions (London, 1774; reprinted, Boston, 1774), and was corrected in the second edition. Sabin (x.
40,468) says it was attributed to Lord Lyttelton, and more probably to Sir William Meredith. The New York
reprint (1774) gave it as <i>A letter from Lord Thomas Lyttelton to Wm. Pitt, Earl of Chatham</i> (Stevens,
<i>Hist. Coll.</i>, ii. no. 433). Wilkie published <i>The justice and policy of the late Act of Parliament, for making
more effectual provision for the government of Quebec, asserted and proved; and the conduct of the administration

<p class="pfc4">There was a reply to the Farmer in <i>Holt's New York Journal</i>, Dec. 22, 1774 (Dawson, p. 40); but the
most extraordinary rejoinder was that of the youthful Alexander Hamilton, then eighteen years old, in <i>A full

<p class="pfc4">A petition to the king was adopted July 8th. It is said to have been moulded, in part at least, upon an
appeal of Richard Stockton, of New Jersey, dated Dec. 12, 1774 (<i>Orderly-book of Sir John Johnson</i>, p. 176-78).

to print and circulate it (<i>Journals</i>, i. 112). Mahon (vol. vi.) says that the king was influenced by a mere punctilio
in not replying to it, and Dartmouth writes to Carleton that it found no favor in or out of Parliament.</p>

the articles in <i>Letters and Papers, 1761-1776</i> (MSS. in Mass. Hist. Soc. library).</p>
<p class="pfc4">In June, 1775, the Congress was called upon to approve the form of autonomy into which the progress of
events had forced the people of Massachusetts Bay. Mr. A. C. Goodell, Jr., has traced the legal bearings of
successive steps in a paper in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, May, 1884, p. 192. The word "province" was renounced,
as the dependence upon the royal governor had ceased; and the word "colony" accepted, as indicating
the modified dependence which still held applicable to the relations of the people to the throne. Up to
April, 1776, the regnal year was used in acts, but upon the Declaration of Independence being received, all
legislative acts run in the name of the "State." For the change of government in New Hampshire, see Belknap's
<i>Hist. of N. Hampshire</i>, and papers in the Belknap MSS. (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, x. 324). An <i>Historical
Sketch of the Hillsborough County Congresses held at Amherst, N. H., 1774 and 1775, with other
Revolutionary Records</i>, by Edw. D. Boylston, was published at Amherst in 1884.</p>
<p class="pfc4">On May 10th Congress adopted <i>Rules and articles for the better government of the troops raised and to be
raised by the twelve United English Colonies</i> (Philad., Watertown, Mass., New York, 1775). Also in Force,
4th ser., ii., 1855; <i>N. H. Prov. Papers</i>, vii. 538; <i>R. I. Col. Rec.</i>, vii. 340; <i>N. J. Prov. Cong.</i>, etc. (1879), p. 264.
The Massachusetts articles of war were much the same. The <i>Rules</i> arranged by Timothy Pickering were
published in 1775, and a presentation copy from Pickering to Gen. John Thomas, with a letter annexed, belongs
to W. A. Thomas, of Kingston, Mass.</p>

the inhabitants of Newport to the Congress is in the <i>R. I. Hist. Mag.</i>, July, 1855.
Sam. Adams wrote, Nov. 16th, from Philadelphia to Bowdoin: "The petition of Congress has been treated
with evident contempt. I cannot conceive that there is any room to hope for the virtuous efforts of the people
of Britain" (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xii., 227). Walpole (<i>Last Journal</i>, i. 439) describes the effects of the
action of this Congress in England.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The most significant controversial reply in England to the action of Congress came from a man of whom
William S. Johnson (Beardsley, p. 71) was reporting to his American friends that he "was not much above
an idiot" in appearance, but could repay one for his unfavorable appearance when he spoke,&mdash;Dr. Samuel
Johnson, who published in 1775 his <i>Taxation no tyranny, an answer to the resolutions and address of the
American Congress</i>, passing through four editions in that year. Macaulay says of it: "The arguments were
such as boys use in debating societies. The pleasantry was as awkward as the gambols of a hippopotamus."
Cf. Johnson's works, all editions; Boswell's <i>Johnson</i>; Bancroft, orig. ed., vii. 257-8; Smyth's <i>Lectures</i>, ii.
399; Fonblanque's <i>Burgoyne</i>, 110; Sabin, ix. 36,303, where (36,304-9) are various tracts which appeared in
answer. Cf. <i>Cooke Catal.</i>, no. 1,315. One of the most prominent of these replies was an anonymous <i>Defence
of the resolutions and address of the American congress, in reply to Taxation no tyranny. By the
author of Regulus. To which are added, general remarks on the leading principles of that work, as published
in the London Evening Post of the 2d and 4th of May; and a short chain of deductions from one
clear position of common sense and experience</i> (London, 1775,&mdash;Sabin, iv. 15,523). The next year the
same writer published <i>A letter to the Rev. Dr.</i> [Richard] <i>Price</i>. Moore's <i>Sheridan</i> (ch. 3) gives an outline
of an intended answer to Johnson.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A sort of semi-official response to the Declaration, made on the part of the government, appeared in the
<i>Rights of Great Britain asserted against the claims of America</i>, which is usually ascribed to Sir John Dalrymple,
though by some to James Macpherson. It appeared in seven or eight editions at London in 1776, and
also the same year at Edinburgh and Philadelphia, and was translated into French (Sabin, v. 18,347). Dalrymple
is said also to have been the writer of an <i>Address of the people of Great Britain to the inhabitants
of America</i>, published anonymously by Cadell, at London, in 1775. This was a conciliatory effort at coöperation
with certain placating measures, which the government sought to promote, and copies of the tract in
large numbers are said to have been sent to America for distribution (Sabin, v. 18,346; <i>Sparks Catal.</i>, no. 709;
Stevens, <i>Nugget</i>, no. 3,106).</p>
<p class="pfc4">A Portuguese Jew, Isaac Pinto, living in Holland, took up the line of argument used in the <i>Rights of Great
Britain</i>, and "employed a venal pen", as Franklin expressed it, "in the most insolent manner, against the
Americans" (<i>Sparks Catal.</i>, no. 2,075; <i>Diplom. Corresp. of the Rev.</i>, ix. 265). Pinto's tracts were addressed
to Samuel Barretts of Jamaica, and were called <i>Lettre ... au sujet des troubles qui agitent actuellement
toute l'Amérique Septentrionale</i>, and a <i>Seconde Lettre</i> (both La Haye, 1776,&mdash;Sabin, xv. 62,988-89). The
English translation, <i>Letters on the American Troubles</i>, appeared the same year in London (Sabin, xv. 62,990).
Pinto was answered in <i>Nouvelles observations</i>, and a <i>Réponse</i> followed, also La Haye, 1776 (Sabin, xiii.
56,095, xv. 62,991).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Almon published in 1775 an <i>Appeal to the justice and interests of the people on the measures respecting
America</i>, and the same year a <i>Second appeal</i>; and later, by the same author, <i>A speech intended to have been
delivered in the House of the Commons in support of the petition from the general Congress at Philad.</i>
There has been much difference of opinion as to the writers of these tracts, the names of Arthur Lee, C.
Glover, Lord Chatham, and Franklin having been mentioned. (Cf. <i>Cooke Catal.</i>, iii. no. 1,033; R. H. Lee's
<i>Life of A. Lee</i>, i. 19.)</p>

"Massachusettensis", a Tory writer, brought out his first letter in the <i>Mass. Gazette</i>, Dec. 12, 1774, and
continued them at intervals till April 3, 1775. The evidence that their writer was Leonard is presented in
Bancroft, orig. ed., vii. 231; by Lucius Manlius Sargent in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Gen. Reg.</i>, July, Oct., 1864, or
vol. xviii. 291, 353 (from the <i>Boston Transcript</i>). The letters were separately published in New York, 1775,
as <i>The present political state of the province of Mass. Bay in general and the town of Boston in particular</i>,
and again as <i>The origin of the Amer. Contest with Great Britain, or the present political state</i>, etc.,&mdash;both
giving the writer as "a native of New England" (Haven in Thomas, ii. p. 660). What is called a second
and third edition (London, 1776) purports to follow a Boston imprint, and is called <i>Massachusettensis, or a
series of letters containing a faithful state of many facts, which laid the foundation of the present troubles,
... by a person of honor upon the spot</i>. (Cf. Sabin, x. p. 219.) There was also an edition in Dublin, 1776
(<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 249). Lecky (iii. 419) speaks of these letters as showing "remarkable eloquence and touching
and manifest earnestness." Trumbull, in the first canto of his <i>M'Fingal</i>, had early assumed that Leonard
was the author. See, on Leonard, Sabine's <i>Amer. Loyalists</i> and Ellis Ames in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
xii. 52.</p>
<p class="pfc4">John Adams, on the patriot side, began Jan. 23, 1775, a series of letters in the <i>Boston Gazette</i>, to counteract
the effect of those of "Massachusettensis", and used the signature "Novanglus." The fight at Lexington
broke off further publication for either disputant. Almon printed an abridgment of these papers in the <i>Remembrancer</i>,
and they were later (London, 1783, 1784) published as <i>A history of the Dispute with America</i>,
and were included finally in C. F. Adams's ed. of <i>John Adams's Works</i> (vol. iv.,&mdash;see also ii. 405, x. 178-79).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Both series were reprinted together in Boston in 1819, with a preface by Adams, who then still considered
Sewall his adversary. Cf. Edmund Quincy's <i>Life of Quincy</i>, p. 381; Frothingham's <i>Rise of the Repub.</i>, 393.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Of the Boston newspapers, <i>Fleet's Evening Post</i> was used indiscriminately as the organ of the patriots and
their opponents, and expired April 24, 1775; the <i>Boston Newsletter</i> passed under governmental control, and
alone continued to be published during the siege of Boston; the <i>Massachusetts Gazette</i> was the chief organ
of the government; the <i>Boston Gazette</i>, devoted to the patriots, and more temperate than the <i>Massachusetts
Spy</i>, which was later removed to Worcester. The most important Massachusetts journal outside of Boston
was the <i>Essex Gazette</i>. (Cf. B. F. Thomas's <i>Memoir of Isaiah Thomas</i>, prefixed to the Amer. Antiq. Society's
ed. of Thomas's <i>Hist. of Printing</i> [also see ii. 294]; J. T. Buckingham's <i>Specimens of newspaper literature</i>;
F. Hudson's <i>American Journalism</i>; <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 130.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">Rivington published in New York the principal paper in the Tory interests, known as the <i>Gazetteer</i>, 1773-1775,
and later as the <i>Loyal</i> and then <i>Royal Gazette</i>. The footnotes in Moore's <i>Diary of the American Revolution</i>
and Thomas's <i>Hist. of Printing</i> will show the newspapers of the other colonies.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The tracts of 1775-76 are too numerous to enumerate. Grahame characterizes the chief writers (<i>United
States</i>, iv. 320). The monthly lists of the <i>Gent. Mag.</i> and <i>Monthly Rev.</i> will show most of their titles for
England. Cf. Adolphus's <i>England</i>, ii. 331; Morgann's <i>Life of Richard Price</i>; Fitzmaurice's <i>Shelburne</i>,
iii. 95. Haven's list for America ends with 1775; but the Brinley, Sparks, and other catalogues give many
of them, and they can be found in Sabin by their authors' names. Many of these tracts embody plans of
reconciliation.</p>

Sabin, xv. nos. 65,444, etc.; P. O. Hutchinson, ii. 38. John Wilkes, who had been Lord Mayor of London
since 1774, brought the influence of its government against the ministry, and Price was offered the freedom of
the city. Wilkes's speech of Feb. 6, 1775, is in Niles (ed. 1776, p. 425). In April, 1775, Wilkes and the aldermen
had appealed to the king against the ministry (Bancroft, orig. ed., vii. 282), and there is a broadside copy
of an appeal, July 5, 1775, by the city to the king, in the Mass. Hist. Soc. library. In Aug., 1775, when the
king issued his proclamation for the suppression of the rebellion, Wilkes paid it studied affront.</p>

Varying views of the current of British feeling will be found in Frothingham's <i>Rise of the Repub.</i>, p. 412,
etc.; in Bancroft, orig. ed., vii. 219, 241, 257, etc., and in the final revision, iv. ch. 22 and 23. Lecky (iii. 573)
thinks the majority of the people were with the king, and Hutchinson reported like views (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i>, xvi. 255). Galloway was still communicating to the ministry secret intelligence through Gov. Franklin,
of New Jersey (<i>N. J. Archives</i>, x. 570), and was causing it to be known that the people in the colonies
who were for war were the violent ones, while the Quakers and the Dutch, the Baptists, Mennonists, and
Dumplers, were for moderation (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i>, xiv. 340).</p>

<p class="pfc4">A letter of John Wesley, June
14, 1775, to the Earl of Dartmouth, protesting
against the war, is among the Dartmouth Papers,
noted in the <i>Hist. MSS. Com. Rept.</i>, ii., and is
printed in <i>Macmillan's Mag.</i>, Dec., 1870. Dartmouth,
July 5th, wrote to Governor Franklin, of
N. Jersey, that the king was determined to crush
the revolt (<i>N. J. Archives</i>, x. 513, 645), and the
king issued his proclamation "for suppressing rebellion and sedition" Aug. 23, 1775. It was sent over in
broadside (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xii. 186), and is printed in Force's <i>Amer. Archives</i>. In September Arthur
Lee was writing of the violent temper of the ministry (<i>Calendar of A. Lee Papers</i>, p. 7, no. 62). The <i>Diary</i>
of Governor Hutchinson helps us much, and throws light on the talk of compromise (ii. 25, 27), the temporary
forgetfulness of the American question in the trial of the Duchess of Kingston (ii. 34), and Pownall's
talk (ii. 127). The military resources of the colonies were not overlooked, and <i>A letter to Lord Geo. Germain</i>
(London, 1776) warned that minister of what this meant, while the decision to pardon criminals in order to
enlist them in the service of suppressing the rebellion did not a little to widen the breach (Lecky, iii. 585).</p>

The subject gets some enlivenment in the Toryism of Walpole's <i>George the Third</i>, edited by Le Marchant,
and his <i>Last Journals</i>, edited by Dr. Doran.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Edmund Burke's conspicuousness makes his character and the record of it of first importance, and we need
for successive estimates of his influence to consult the lives of him by Bisset, Prior, P. Burke, and Macknight.
For his bearing as a speaker, see Wraxall's <i>Hist. Memoirs</i> (ii. 35). For an estimate of his arguments, see
Smyth's <i>Lectures</i> (Bohn's ed., ii. 403, 408). His speeches on American Taxation (April 19, 1774) and conciliation
(March 22, 1775) are in the various collected editions of his <i>Works</i>,&mdash;among the best of such being the
Boston edition (1865, etc., Little, Brown &amp; Co.) and the edition published by Nimmo (1885),&mdash;all of them
following in the main Rivington's first octavo edition in 16 vols., London, 1801-27. Henry Morley has edited,
with an introduction, Burke's <i>Two speeches on Conciliation with America</i> (London, 1886). His speech of
March 22, 1775, is in Niles's <i>Principles</i>, etc. (1876 ed., p. 429). Lecky (iii. 426) sketches his policy. For conversations
of Burke and North, see <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Nov., 1881, p. 358.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The lives and speeches of Chatham are quite as necessary. Franklin was introduced into the Lords in Jan.,
1775, by Chatham himself, when Chatham brought forward his motion for conciliation with America, and
Franklin considered as much the best the notes which Josiah Quincy, Jr., made (Jan. 20, 1775) of the speeches
of Chatham and Camden (<i>Life of J. Quincy, Jr.</i>, 226, 264, 272, 318, 335, 403, 418; Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, v. 43).
Among the Cathcart MSS. is a contemporary copy of Chatham's plan which the Lords rejected (<i>Hist. MSS.
Com. Rept.</i>, ii. p. 28). The later speech of Dec. 20, 1775, for removing the troops from Boston, is also in
Niles (1876 ed., p. 455). Cf. Gordon, i. 298; Force, 4th ser., i. 1,494; Smyth's <i>Lectures</i>, ii.; Parton's <i>Franklin</i>,
ii. Mahon says that the whole spirit evaporates from the reports of Chatham's speeches in Almon. In
March, 1775, Camden made a speech which Hutchinson (P. O. Hutchinson's <i>Governor Hutchinson</i>, 408, 410)
describes and imagines Camden to have made in order that Franklin might take the speech to America.
Hutchinson also in the same month describes Franklin in the Commons gallery, "staring with his spectacles",
and listening to the speeches against America. Two speeches of Mansfield against America were criticised in
<i>The Plea of the Colonies on the Charges brought against them by Lord M&mdash;&mdash;d and others</i> (London, 1775,
1776; Philad., 1777,&mdash;Sabin, xv. 63,401-2).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Charles James Fox had been dismissed from the Tory government in 1774, and was now on the opposition
side, a young and vehement debater of twenty-five (Lecky, iii. 571; Russell's <i>Mem. and Corresp. of Fox</i>, and
his <i>Life and Times of Fox</i>; numerous references in <i>Poole's Index</i>, p. 472). On the relations of English parties
to the American question, see Lecky (iii. 586); Campbell's <i>Life of Loughborough</i>, in his <i>Lord Chancellors</i>;
<i>Rockingham and his Contemporaries</i>; Geo. W. Cooke's <i>Hist. of Party</i> (London, 1786-87; 1837, vol.

Cf. Parton's <i>Franklin</i>, ii. 41, 44; Mahon, v. 24; Niles (1876 ed.), 476, <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, xlvii. Franklin left
London in March, 1775, and on his voyage home he wrote out an account of his recent negotiations, which is
printed in Sparks (vol. i.) and in Bigelow (ii. 256). There are different copies of this paper (Parton, ii. 71);
and Stevens (<i>Hist. Coll.</i>, i. p. 160 D) has an account of one given to Jefferson (Bigelow, ii. 253).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Just before leaving London, Franklin wrote some articles for the <i>Public Advertiser</i> on <i>The Rise and
Progress of the Difference between Great Britain and her American Colonies</i>, which are reprinted in

with Gage was that the country Tories should
be allowed to move into Boston. Among those
who soon found their way into Boston, but under
difficulties, were Lady Frankland and Benjamin
Thompson, afterwards Count Rumford. (<i>Evacuation

Various papers respecting the capture of
Ticonderoga and Crown Point in the spring of
1775, and movements thereabouts, are in the
Mass. Archives, including letters of John Brown,
Arnold, Allen, Easton, and some of these are
copied in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>, vol. lx. Sparks indorses
on a copy of the letter of the Mass. committee
at Crown Point, June 23, 1776: "By the
journal of the Mass. assembly it appears that
Arnold, on his way to Ticonderoga, had engaged
a company of men in Stockbridge, who marched
on the 10th of May, under Captain Abraham
Brown, but how far is uncertain."</p>

Washington, on his arrival in Cambridge,
recognized the services of Col. Joseph Ward,
who at this time had borne an order from General
Ward across Charlestown Neck amid the
cross-fire of the British batteries, by giving him
a brace of pistols, now preserved; and perhaps
the only written order of the battlefield now remaining
is a requisition by Jos. Ward for ammunition,
which is given in fac-simile in <i>Mem. Hist.

Ward.  Cf. also J. V. Cheney in <i>Scribner's

When Elisha Hutchinson, in London, heard
of the battle, he said: "If every small hill or
rising ground about Boston is to be recovered in
the same way, I see no prospect of an end to the
war." (P. O. Hutchinson's <i>Governor Hutchinson</i>,
p. 506.) Belknap (<i>Papers</i>, published by Mass.
Hist. Soc., ii. 159) says the criticism on Howe
for attacking in front was general. The royalist
Jones, in his <i>New York during the Revolutionary
War</i> (i. 52), charges the British general with obstinacy
in this respect. Lee (<i>Memoirs of the
War in the Southern Department</i>, 2d ed., p. 33)
traces Howe's subsequent timidity in his conduct
of campaigns to the lesson this battle taught
him.</p>

The provincial congress of New York assembled
on the 22d of May, and it soon became
evident that some violent wrenching would be
necessary to unloose the grasp which the loyalists
had upon it. The Johnsons, with their Indian
affiliations, were strong royalists, and the
leadership of the family, by the death of Sir
William in July, 1774, fell to his son-in-law and
nephew, Guy Johnson. The motives which actuated
the one remained with the other.</p>

<p class="pfc4">On the 22d. of June, 1775, Hancock had written
to Ward, transmitting his commission as
first major-general, and next in command after
Washington. He says of the new commander-in-chief,
that "he takes his departure to-morrow
morning from this city [Philadelphia] in order
to enter upon his command. I the rather (he
adds) mention the circumstance of his departure,
that you may direct your movements for his reception."
(<i>Ward MSS.</i>, in Mass. Hist. Society.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">The assumption of command by Washington
under this tree rests, so far as the writer knows,
on tradition only, and he knows of no detail of
the ceremonies given by contemporary evidence,

as <i>Letter from General Lee to General Burgoyne,
with General Lee's answer, and the letter
declining an interview</i> (Boston, 1775). Cf. Haven,
in Thomas, ii. p. 659. The letters are given
in the <i>Lee Papers</i> (<i>N. Y. Hist. Coll.</i>, 1871, pp.
180, 188, 222), and were translated into German
and published at Braunschweig, 1777. (Sabin,
iii. no. 5,259.) When Burgoyne sailed for
England, Lee says, in a letter written from the
camp at Winter Hill, Dec. 15, 1775: "I have
written a parting letter to Burgoyne. It is in my
opinion the most tolerable of my performances."

<p class="pfc4">It was Burgoyne's opinion at this time that no
force which Great Britain and Ireland could supply
would bring the war to a speedy conclusion;
while he thought that hiring foreign troops, levying
Canadians, and arming blacks and Indians,
might do it. (Fonblanque, 153.) By July 3,
Dartmouth had become aware that almost every
colony had caught the flame, and he had deduced
from Gage's letters that twenty thousand men
would be required to reduce New England alone.
Burgoyne soon began to chafe under Gage's inaction,
and urged him to transfer the army to
New York. (Fonblanque, p. 190.) He writes
to the ministry about "being invested on one
side and asleep on the other" (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 198), and
says Gage is "amiable for his virtues, but not
equal to the situation."</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is in the Mass. Hist. Soc. library (Misc.

Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, iii. 113. Gage had, as
early as July 14, 1775, pronounced Boston a
"disadvantageous place for all operations", and
expressed a preference for New York as a base
of operations. The government had advised
(Sept. 5, 1775) Howe to abandon the town. Before
Howe, perhaps, got this, Gage wrote to
Dartmouth that "the possession of Boston occasions
a considerable diversion of the enemy's
force; but it is open to attacks on many sides,
and requires a large body to defend it." In November
Howe had made up his mind that he
must winter, at least, in Boston. (<i>Mass. Hist.
Soc. Proc.</i>, xiv. 353, 354, 356.) The Secretary of
War, as early as Nov. 12, 1774, had urged that
Boston was a place where the royal troops could
do little good, and might do much harm. (<i>Life
of Barrington</i>, 140.)</p>

Dr. Peter Oliver wrote (Nov. 27) from Boston:
"The pirates, or, as the rebels term them,
the privateers, have taken a Cork vessel, Captain
Robbins, of this town, with provisions, and
carried her into Marblehead; and a number of
wood vessels from the eastward are carried into
the worthless town of Plymouth." P. O. Hutchinson,
i. p. 571. Again, Dec. 7, he writes: "We
have eight or ten pirate vessels out between the
capes; and yet our men-of-war are chiefly in the
harbor." <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 581. Admiral Graves was as
inactive as Gage, and, on Dec. 30, Admiral
Shuldham arrived with orders to relieve him.
Percy, writing from Boston of the new admiral,
says: "We wanted a more active man than the
last, for really the service suffered materially
during his stay." (<i>Percy Letters</i>, in Boston Pub.
Library.) Curwen records how matters at this
time were regarded in London: "Their [the
rebels'] activity and success is astonishing."</p>

Percy wrote from Boston, January 7, 1776:
"I take it for granted that the next campaign
will be so active and, I hope, so decisive a one,
that the rebels will be glad to sue for mercy. All,
however, will depend on our having a sufficient
force sent us out very early in the spring....
Brig. Gen. Grant directs our commander-in-chief
and all his operations. Mr. Howe is, I think,
the only one here in his army who does not perceive
it. I wish from my soul that we may not
feel the consequences." (<i>Percy Letters.</i>) Hutchinson
was writing in January, 1776, from London:
"I count the days, and absurd as it is so
near the close of life, I can hardly help wishing
to sleep away the time between this and spring,
that I may escape the succession of unfortunate
events which I am always in fear of." (P. O.
Hutchinson, vol. ii.)</p>

Burgoyne had suggested the occupation of

Clinton says (<i>Notes on Stedman</i>) that he had
told Gage and Howe, in June, 1775, that if ever
the royal army was forced to evacuate Boston,
it would be owing to the rebels getting possession
of Dorchester Heights. What is given
in T. C. Simond's <i>South Boston</i>, p. 31, as "a plan
of Dorchester Neck for the use of the British
army", seems to be but an extract from Pelham's

Nearly eighty armed vessels and transports
were necessary to carry the army and its followers,
but a large number of other vessels loaded
with merchandise accompanied the fleet. Abigail
Adams counted 170 sail in all, from her

they would steer for New York, and so had
warned the New York authorities as early as

John Adams understood these sectional difficulties.
<i>Works</i>, ix. 367. Cf., on the New England
distrust of Schuyler, Sparks's <i>Washington</i>,
iii. 535. Bancroft says of Schuyler that he was
"choleric and querulous, and was ill suited to
control undisciplined levies of turbulent freemen."
Schuyler, who was honest and uncompromisingly
zealous, is defended in Lossing's <i>Life of
Schuyler</i>, where (vol. ii. 27) Bancroft's assertion
(original ed., viii. 423) that Schuyler "refused to
go into Canada" is controverted on the ground
that Congress declined to accept Schuyler's resignation,
when ill-health prevented his leading the
army. Bancroft, in his final revision (iv. 377),
says of Schuyler that he owned himself unable
to manage the men of Connecticut, and proposed
to resign. The differences between Schuyler
and Wooster have led to much championing of
the two by writers of New York and Connecticut.
Wooster, a man now of sixty-five years,
austere in habit, could hardly be expected to
commend himself to one of Schuyler's temperament.

There is a likeness of Thomas, owned by
Mrs. Williams, of New York, a descendant. This
portrait was engraved for the illustrated edition
of Irving's <i>Washington</i>, and is reproduced in
Jones's <i>Campaign for the Conquest of Canada</i>,
p. 52. There is a brief memoir, <i>Life and Services
of Maj.-Gen. John Thomas, compiled by Chas.
Coffin</i> (New York, 1844). In July, 1775, Thomas
had been justly irritated at the irresponsible action
of Congress in ranking the general officers
of its appointment, and had only been prevented
from resigning by Washington's urging
him to pause. W. B. Reed, in his <i>Life of Joseph
Reed</i> (i. 109), prints this appeal of Washington
from the draft in Reed's handwriting.</p>

Reed's letters from the camp during the
summer of 1775 are in the <i>Life of Joseph Reed</i>,
i. 116, etc., as well as those of Washington (p.
125, etc.) to Reed during the autumn and winter,
after the departure of the latter. Sparks thought
these letters of Washington the most imperfect
he had seen, being written in great haste and
confidence. Sparks printed them in part. Reed
gives them at length. Washington's letters to
Reed from the Cambridge camp make 20 of the
51 letters constituting the lot of his correspondence
with Reed, which, having passed from Mr.
William B. Reed to Mr. Menzies, was sold at
the latter's sale (no. 2,051), and was again sold
in the J. J. Cooke sale ($2,250) in Dec., 1883,
when they passed into the Carter-Brown library.
The <i>Cooke Catalogue</i> (pp. 340-349) describes
them mainly as Mr. Reed prepared the statement,
and they are commented on in the <i>No. Am. Rev.</i>,
July, 1852, p. 203, and in Irving's <i>Washington</i>, ii.
178. The original draft of Washington's letter
to his officers, Sept. 8, 1775, asking their views
respecting a boat attack on Boston, is among
them (<i>Cooke Catal.</i>, p. 342), while a fair copy in
Washington's hand, as addressed to Ward, is
among the Ward MSS. in the Mass. Hist. Society's
library. It is printed in Sparks, iii. 80.</p>

The tower upon which the lanterns were hung is a matter of dispute, Revere's "North Church" being
considered by some to have been the church in North Square, Boston, pulled down by the British during the
siege, and by others the present Christ Church, and it is upon the latter that the tourist to-day is shown an
inscription identifying that building with the event. Richard Frothingham, in a letter to the mayor of Boston,
called <i>The alarm on the night of April 18, 1775</i> (Boston, 1876, 2nd ed., 1877) protested against this act,
and wrote in favor of the church in North Square. The other alternative was upheld by the Rev. John Lee
Watson in a letter to the <i>Boston Daily Advertiser</i>, July 20, 1876, and this was printed separately in 1877 as
<i>Paul Revere's Signal, with remarks by Charles Deane</i>, and in a second edition with an additional letter in
1880. (Cf. <i>Proc. Mass. Hist. Soc.</i>, Nov., 1876.) This second letter was mainly in answer to William W.
Wheildon's <i>History of Paul Revere's Signal Lanterns</i> (Concord, 1878), in which, while accepting the Christ
Church theory, it was claimed that Robert Newman was the person who showed the lanterns, and not John
Pulling, as averred by Mr. Watson (cf. note in Everett's <i>Orations</i>, i. p. 101). Mr. Deane had shown that,
both before and after the destruction of the church in North Square, Christ Church had been called the North
Church; while the earliest use of that designation for the latter building seems to have been in one of Dr.
Stiles's almanacs in 1754, where he speaks of "Dr. Cutler's <i>alias</i> North, <i>alias</i> Christ Church." (<i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>, Aug., 1884, p. 256.) E. G. Porter's <i>Rambles in Old Boston, N. E.</i>, favors Christ Church.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Among the more general histories, the fullest account of this ride can be found in S. A. Drake's <i>Middlesex
County</i>, i. ch. 16.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Mr. E. H. Goss printed a paper on Revere in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Jan., 1886, p. 3, giving, among
other cuts, a view of his birthplace(?) in North Square, in Boston. There is a portrait of him, with a note on
other likenesses, in <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 69. Cf. also T. W. Higginson in <i>Harper's Monthly</i>, Oct., 1883,

[Lexington], and particularly about the arrival of Captain Derby and the intelligence he brought. He
was examined by order of the ministers, and he seems to have acted a bold part in circulating the intelligence.... In
the first dispatch to General Gage he was censured for not sending the particulars immediately, and
ordered to keep a packet in constant readiness."</p>

These depositions of the combatants, thus falling among Arthur Lee's papers, were finally separated in
a strange division, by the younger R. H. Lee, who gave a part to Harvard College and a part to the University

One of these despatches, dated Watertown, April 19, endorsed by the officers of the towns through which
it had passed, is printed in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, Oct., 1873, p. 434. It is pointed out in Greene's
<i>Life of Nathanael Greene</i> (i. 77), how the news affected Rhode Island. The confused statements which
reached Connecticut can be seen in the Deane Correspondence in the <i>Conn. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, ii. 218, and in
the broadside <i>Letter of James Lockwood and Isaac Bears, dated Wallingford, April 24, 1775, respecting
the Battle near Winter Hill, in which Lord Percy was killed</i>. The news reached New York, Sunday, April
23, and the response was sudden. Vessels loaded for Boston were seized; arsenals were taken in charge, and
cannon planted at Kingsbridge (Dawson's <i>Battles</i>, i. 130, and his <i>Westchester County during the Amer. Rev.</i>,
Morrisania, 1886, p. 75; Bancroft, orig. ed., vii. 328; Leake's <i>Lamb</i>, 101; <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Apr., 1882,
p. 283). Governor Colden describes the effects in his despatch to Dartmouth (<i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, viii. 571).
Jones, in his <i>New York during the Rev. War</i> (i. 39, 497), gives a curiously perverted story, saying, among
other things, that the British muskets were unloaded when the Americans attacked them at Lexington, and
describes the stormy meeting of the governor's council in the afternoon. From New Jersey, Governor Franklin
wrote to Dartmouth May 6, and June 5 and 7. (<i>New Jersey Archives</i>, x. 590, 601, 642.) The tidings
reached Philadelphia April 24, and the original endorsed despatch is in the Pennsylvania Hist. Soc. library.
(<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1864, p. 23; Hazard's <i>Reg. of Penna.</i>, iii. 175, Christopher Marshall's <i>Diary</i>,
p. 18.) In the second week in May the news reached Western Pennsylvania, and the resolutions which were
passed at Hannastown were drawn by St. Clair (<i>St. Clair Papers</i>, i. 363). It reached Williamsburg, Va.,
April 29 (Moore's <i>Diary</i>, i. 75.) It came to Kentucky just as the settlers were founding a town, and they
named it Lexington. (Winthrop's <i>Speeches</i>, 1878, etc., p 106.) A despatch which was written at Wallingford,
Conn., April 24, embodying the reports which had reached that point, and representing that both the American
commander and Lord Percy had been killed, was sent South, receiving endorsements as it passed along, and
reached Charleston, S. C., May 10 6.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> It is given in R. W. Gibbs's <i>Doc. Hist. of the Amer. Rev.</i>,
pp. 82-91. (See broadside mentioned above.) A military company, the Fusiliers, was at once formed, and its
roll and career are registered in the <i>Charleston Year Book</i>, 1885, p. 342.</p>

Clark's is appended to a discourse which he delivered on the first anniversary in 1776, and this was
reprinted in 1875. It was also reprinted in the <i>Massachusetts Mag.</i>, 1794. Emerson's, which makes three
pages of an interleaved almanac (which was in the possession of his grandson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, when
the fac-simile was made, which is here followed, so far as the first page goes), was first printed by R. W. Emerson
in his <i>Historical Discourse</i> in 1835 (republished in 1875), and again in the <i>American Historical Magazine
and Literary Record</i>, New Haven, 1836. Other early anniversary sermons add little or nothing to our
knowledge; such are Samuel Cooke's <i>The violent destroyed and oppressed delivered</i> (Lexington, 1777, but
printed in Boston, 1777), and Philip Payson's sermon, also at Lexington, in 1782. Sermons were preached at
Concord from 1776 to 1783; the series is in the Mass. Hist. Society's library. A sermon preached by John
Langdon, at Watertown, May 31, 1775, refers to the fight. This is reprinted in J. W. Thornton's <i>Pulpit of
the Amer. Revolution</i>.</p>

also tells Trumbull that the royal troops "disclaim with indignation the barbarous outrages of which they are
accused, so contrary to their known humanity. I have taken the greatest pains (he adds) to discover if any
were committed, and have found examples of their tenderness both to the young and the old, but no vestige of

There is also a table of casualties at Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill, in the <i>Hist. of the War in

men who were on duty on that day are in what are called the Lexington alarm rolls in the State Archives (<i>Revolutionary
Rolls</i>, vols. xi., xii., and xiii.). The histories of towns which sent companies usually print such lists,
as the <i>Hist. of Sutton</i>, p. 783, etc. The losses of property sustained by Lexington during the day, as figured
in 1780, is given in the <i>Mass. Archives</i>, cxxxviii. p. 410; and the Report of the Committee of the Provincial
Congress on the losses along the line of march is given in Wm. Lincoln's ed. of the <i>Journals of the Prov.
Congresses</i> (Boston, 1838). This report makes the damage done by the king's troops in Concord, £274 16<i>s.</i>

committee of Congress&mdash;Silas Deane, John Adams, and George Wyeth&mdash;were addressing letters to get information
respecting extent of losses inflicted by the ministerial troops. One of these, addressed to Ezra Stiles,
is in <i>Letters and Papers</i>, 1761-1776 (MSS. in Mass. Hist. Soc.).</p>

Stedman, who was not present, and most British writers, say the Americans fired first, as did Pitcairn,
whose representations, as reported by Stiles in his diary, are given by Frothingham (p. 62), and by Irving (<i>Life
of Washington</i>, i. 393). One tory, on talking with the British soldiers afterwards, was satisfied that they were
the aggressors. (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiii. 60.) Hudson, in a paper on Pitcairn in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>,
xvii. 318, examines the question. (Cf. Frothingham's <i>Warren</i>, 488; <i>Evelyns in America</i>, 299, 303; Mahon's
<i>England</i>, vi. 36.) A deposition of one Sylvanus Wood, taken in 1826, says that the stories in this country of
the Americans firing first were started long after the event. Dawson (i. 22) prints this document.</p>

year Mr. Frothingham condensed the story of the battle into a little volume,&mdash;<i>The Centennial: Battle of
Bunker Hill</i> (Boston, 1875). Mr. Frothingham's enthusiasm for his subject may be easily misjudged by the
unsympathetic reader. P. O. Hutchinson says of the <i>Siege</i>: "This would be a creditable book if it were not
so overloaded with boast, tall talk, and self-glorification." (<i>Life of Governor Hutchinson</i>, p. 11.)</p>

<i>Bibliography of Charlestown</i>, etc., p. 19. Taking precedence in time is that in the <i>Boston Gazette</i> of
June 19, at this time printed at Watertown. The <i>Massachusetts Spy</i> (Worcester, June 21st) had the next
account, and this is reprinted in Frothingham's <i>Centennial</i>. The <i>Connecticut Journal</i> printed an account
the same day; and in New York a handbill was circulated, <i>Fresh news just arrived</i>, by an express from
the provincial camp near Boston, giving an account by Capt. Elijah Hide, of Lebanon. See fac-simile in
<i>Mag. of American Hist.</i>, March, 1885, p. 282. Hide saw the battle from Winter Hill, and his account is
printed by Ellis (1843), p. 142, and Dawson, p. 378. Frank Moore's <i>Diary of the American Revolution</i> (i.
pp. 97, 102), which begins Jan. 1, 1775, gives most of these contemporary press articles, and so does Dawson.
Several of these newspaper accounts were reproduced in fac-simile in 1875.</p>

This was first printed by Frothingham (<i>Siege</i>, etc., p. 395), and is also in Dawson, p. 390, and in his <i>Battles</i>,
i. p. 70. A paper usually called <i>The Prescott MS.</i>, said to have been prepared under Colonel Prescott's
supervision, in part at least, abridged in Graydon's <i>Memoirs</i> (1846), is printed in Butler's <i>Groton</i> (p. 337)
and in Dawson. A memoir prepared by Judge Prescott, son of the colonel, derived in part from his recollection
of his father's accounts, is printed in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiv. 68, and in Frothingham's <i>Battle-Field</i>,
p. 18.</p>

The MS. of this account is in the Am. Antiq. Society's Collections at Worcester, and was printed in
Dawson, p. 381. Cf. <i>Belknap Papers</i>, ii. 163, 166. Frothingham (<i>Siege</i>, p. 385) gives Thacher's indorsement
of the MS. This narrative and that of Gordon, mainly following it, were the basis of some elaborate papers
in the <i>Analectic Magazine</i> (Feb. and March, 1818), which, however, present some important differences of
view, supported by documents.</p>

It is signed by J. Palmer, and dated July 25, 1775, and was transmitted to Arthur Lee. It is printed in

Charles Coffin, at Saco in 1831 and at Portland in 1835, published a <i>History of the Battle of Bunker Hill</i>,
which was compiled from the accounts by Heath, Wilkinson, Lee, and Dearborn. Of less importance are Dr.
Belknap's note-book and letters (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiv. 92, 96, etc.); <i>Adventures of Israel R. Potter</i>
(Providence, 1824); Oliver Morsman's <i>Hist. of Breed's, commonly called Bunker's Hill Battle</i> (Sacketts Harbor,
1830); Col. E. Bancroft's narrative (J. B. Hill's <i>Bicentennial of Old Dunstable</i>, Nashua, 1878); <i>Columbian
Centinel</i> (Dec., 1824; Jan., 1825); Needham Maynard (Boston newspaper, 1843); Timothy Dwight
(<i>Travels in New England</i>, New Haven, 1821, vol. i. 468-476), who knew some of the actors, and who says
that a member of the council of war held the day before told him that the representations of an old hunter,
that it was better to fire a small number of shots well aimed than many carelessly, induced the council to order
fifteen rounds to a man instead of sixty.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A large number of depositions of supposed survivors were made in 1818 and 1825, but they are held to be
of no value by the critical student. There is a transcript in three folio volumes, made in William Sullivan's
office, of some of the latter date, preserved in the cabinet of the Mass. Hist. Society. What purported to be
some of the originals were offered for sale in New York in 1877, but were bid in. C. L. Woodward, of New
York, advertised in May, 1883, nearly two hundred papers, which were called Col. Swett's Collection of Affidavits,
priced at $200 (<i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 104).</p>

He ceases, however, to speak of "the age and infirmities" of Ward, as Carrington indeed does, calling
him "advanced in years and feeble in body", and as many of the writers have, misled perhaps by the somewhat
elderly appearance of the usual portrait of him. He was in fact but forty-eight years old!</p>

The connection of Putnam with the final stand at Prospect Hill naturally conveyed the impression of his
commanding through the day, as he was known to have been by turns upon different parts of the field. Gen.
Greene, who hurried up from Rhode Island that night, got this impression from the understanding of the case
which he found prevailing in the Roxbury lines, when he wrote back the next day (June 18) to Gov. Cooke, of
Rhode Island. "General Putnam", he says, "had taken post at Bunker's Hill, and flung up an entrenchment
with a detachment of about three hundred" (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, no. xlviii. p. 67). This notion reached England,
and on a print of Putnam published there Sept. 9, which is annexed, Putnam is called commander-in-chief
(<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Nov., 1881, p. 102). An American engraving, by Roman, which appeared shortly
afterwards, represents Putnam on horseback at the redoubt, as if commanding there. Col. Trumbull gave
him similar prominence when he painted his well-known picture in 1786, though he is said to have regretted
it at a later day. The earliest general narrative to give the command to Prescott was Gordon's, which followed
closely the account of the Committee of Safety, and this was printed in 1788. The <i>Life of Putnam</i> by Humphreys
was published in 1788, while Putnam was still living, and makes no mention of his having the command;
but the Rev. Josiah Whitney, in 1790, in a note to a sermon preached upon the death of Putnam,
took exception to this oversight (Stevens's <i>Hist. Coll.</i>, i. no. 685). In 1809, Eliot, in his <i>Biographical Dictionary</i>,
represents Prescott as commanding at the redoubt and Stark at the rail fence. When Gen. Wilkinson's
<i>Memoirs</i> were published, in 1816 (reviewed in the <i>N. Am. Rev.</i>, Nov., 1817), the conduct of Putnam on
that day was represented in no favorable light; and Gen. Henry Dearborn, who was with Stark at the rail fence,
asserted that Putnam remained inactive in the rear. It is also significant that Major Thompson Maxwell,
who was with Reed's regiment at the rail fence, also asserted that Prescott commanded (<i>Essex Inst. Hist.
Coll.</i>, vol. vii.; <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, Jan., 1868, p. 57). Dearborn's statement was made in a paper
in the <i>Portfolio</i> (March, 1818), which is reprinted in the <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, August, 1864, and June, 1868 (Dawson,
p. 402). It was printed also separately at the time in Philadelphia and Boston (1818) as <i>An Account of the
Battle of Bunker Hill with De Bernière's map corrected by General Dearborn</i> (16 pp.). Col. Daniel Putnam
replied in the <i>Portfolio</i> (May, 1818) with numerous depositions (all reprinted by Dawson, p. 407), which
was issued separately as <i>A letter to Maj. Gen. Dearborn, repelling his unprovoked attack on the character
of the late Maj. General Putnam, and containing some anecdotes relating to the Battle of Bunker
Hill, not generally known</i> (Philadelphia, 1818). Both tracts were reprinted as an <i>Account of the Battle of
Bunker's Hill, by H. Dearborn, Major-General of the United States Army; with a letter to Maj. Gen.
Dearborn, repelling his unprovoked attack on the character of the late Maj.-Gen. Israel Putnam, by Daniel
Putnam, Esq.</i> (Boston: Munroe &amp; Francis, 1818). Each document is paged separately, and the last has a
separate title. Dearborn replied in the <i>Boston Patriot</i> (June 13, 1818), with depositions, all of which are in
Dawson, p. 414. See account of Gen. Dearborn by Daniel Goodwin, Jr., in the <i>Chicago Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> In
July, 1818, Daniel Webster, in the <i>North Amer. Rev.</i>, vindicated Putnam, but claimed for Prescott as much
of a general command during the day as any one had, which claim he held to be established by Prescott's
making his report to Ward at Cambridge when it was over. (Cf. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, June, 1858.) John
Lowell offered counter-depositions in the <i>Columbian Centinel</i> (July 4 and 15, 1818), again reprinted in Dawson,
p. 423. In October, 1818, Col. Samuel
Swett appended an <i>Historical and Topographical
Sketch of Bunker Hill Battle</i> to
a new edition of Humphrey's <i>Life of Putnam</i>.
In the <i>Boston Patriot</i>, Nov. 17, 1818,
D. L. Child claimed that Putnam was not in
the battle, and he published separately <i>An
Enquiry into the Conduct of Gen. Putnam</i>
(Boston, 1819). In 1825, Swett enlarged his text, and published it as a <i>History of the battle of Bunker Hill</i>
(Boston, 1825), followed by <i>Notes</i> to his <i>Sketch</i> in Dec., 1825. His history passed to a second edition as a
<i>History of the Bunker Hill Battle, with a plan. By S. Swett. Second Edition, much enlarged with new
information derived from the surviving soldiers present at the celebration on the 17th June last, and notes</i>
(Boston, 1826). A third appeared in 1827. (Cf. Sparks in <i>N. Am. Rev.</i>, vol. xxii.)</p>

<p class="pfc4">A new advocate for Putnam appeared in Alden Bradford's <i>Particular Account of the Battle of Bunker or
Breed's Hill, by a Citizen of Boston</i> (two editions, Boston, 1825, and since reprinted); while Daniel Putnam
during the same year recapitulated his views in a communication to the Bunker Hill Monument Association
(<i>Conn. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, vol. i.). A summary of this Putnam-Dearborn controversy is given in G. W. Warren's
<i>Hist. of the Bunker Hill Monument Association</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The dispute now remained dormant till 1841, when George E. Ellis delivered an oration at Charlestown,
and then, and in his <i>Sketches of Bunker Hill Battle, with illustrative documents</i> (Charlestown, 1843), he
presented at fuller length than had been before done the claims of Prescott to be considered the commander.
This led to a criticism and rejoinder by Swett and Ellis in the <i>Boston Daily Advertiser</i>. See Judge Prescott's
letter to Dr. Ellis in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> (iv. 76), and another to Col. Swett (xiv. 78. Cf. Memoir
of Swett and a list of his publications in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1867, p. 374). In 1843, John
Fellows, in <i>The Veil Removed; or reflections an David Humphrey's essay on the life of Israel Putnam;
also, notices of Oliver W. B. Peabody's life of the same; S. Swett's sketch of Bunker Hill</i>, etc. (New York,
1843), ranged himself among the detractors of Putnam.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In 1849, the question was again elaborately examined in Frothingham's <i>Siege of Boston</i> (p. 159, etc.), favoring
Prescott, which produced Swett's <i>Who was the Commander at Bunker Hill?</i> (Boston, 1850), and Frothingham's
rejoinder, <i>The Command in the battle of Bunker Hill</i> (Boston, 1850). Cf. also the <i>Report</i> to the
Massachusetts Legislature on a monument to Col. Prescott (1852). In 1853, Irving favored Prescott (<i>Washington</i>,
vol. i.). In 1855, L. Grosvenor, in an address before the descendants of Putnam, reiterated that general's
claims. In 1857, Barry (<i>Hist. of Mass.</i>, iii. 39) gave to Prescott the command in the redoubt, and to
Putnam a general direction outside the redoubt. In 1858, Bancroft in his <i>History</i> (vol. vii.) took the view
substantially held by the present writer. In 1859, Mr. A. C. Griswold, as "Selah", of the <i>Hartford Post</i>, had
a controversy with H. B. Dawson, who exceeded others in his denunciation of Putnam, and this correspondence
was printed as parts 6 and 11 of Dawson's <i>Gleanings from the Harvest-field of American History</i> (Morrisania,
1860-63), with the distinctive title <i>Major General Putnam</i>. In 1860, the Hon. H. C. Deming published
an address on the occasion of the presentation of Putnam's sword to the Conn. Hist. Society.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The question of the command was again discussed at the season of the Centennial of 1875. The chief papers
in favor of Putnam were by I. N. Tarbox in the <i>N. Y. Herald</i> (June 12 and 14), in the <i>New Englander</i>
(April, 1876), and in his <i>Life of Putnam</i>; by S. A. Drake in his <i>General Israel Putnam the Commander at
Bunker Hill</i>; by W. W. Wheildon in his letters to the <i>N. Y. Herald</i> (June 16 and 17) and in his <i>New History
of the battle of Bunker Hill</i>. Gen. Charles Devens' oration in <i>The Celebration of the Centennial
Anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill</i> (Boston, 1875) did not extend Prescott's command beyond the
redoubt, as was done, however, in Francis J. Parker's <i>Colonel Wm. Prescott the Commander in the Battle of
Bunker's Hill</i> (Boston, 1875), and his paper "Could General Putnam command at Bunker's Hill?" in <i>New
Eng. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i> (Oct., 1877, p. 403). During this same year, Dr. George E. Ellis recast the
material of his earlier book in his <i>History of the Battle of Bunker's (Breed's) Hill</i> (Boston, 1875, in 16mo
and 8vo, the last revised).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Centennial period produced, also, various magazine articles, the most important of which are one by
H. E. Scudder in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, July, 1875; one by Launce Poyntz in the <i>Galaxy</i>, July, 1875; one
by Dr. Samuel Osgood in <i>Harper's Monthly</i>, July, 1875; and those which later constituted a brochure, <i>One
Hundred Years Ago</i>, by Edward E. Hale.</p>

The earliest English accounts which we have are two dated June 18, a letter of John Randon, a soldier
(Lamb's <i>Journal of Occurrences</i>, 33; Dawson, 358), and that of an officer of rank from Boston (Force, iv.;
Dawson, 357; Ellis, 115). Written on June 19, is a short letter from Brig.-Gen. Jones, colonel of the fifty-second
regiment (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiv. 91; Frothingham's <i>Battle-Field</i>, 45). Henry Hulton, commissioner
of his majesty's customs at Boston, wrote a long letter on June 20 (Emmons's <i>Sketches of Bunker
Hill Battle</i>, 123; Dawson, 359; Ellis, 123). On the 22d, Adjutant Waller, of the Royal Marines, wrote a letter
which is given in S. A. Drake's <i>Bunker Hill, the Story told in Letters from the Battlefield</i>. (Cf. P. H.
Nicholas's <i>Historical Record of the Royal Marine Forces</i>, London, 1845, i. 84-89.) On the 23d we have the
account of an officer on one of the king's ships (Force, iv.; Dawson, 360; Ellis, 117), and a brief letter by
Dr. Grant, one of the surgeons (Dawson, 361; Ellis, 114). On the 24th, a merchant in Boston writes to his
brother in Scotland (Ellis, 119).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The 25th of June must have been a letter day in Boston, in anticipation of the sailing of the despatch ship
"Cerberus", for we have several letters of that date. Gage wrote then his official despatch to Lord Dartmouth,
which reached London July 25, but a vessel had arrived at Waterford a week earlier (July 18), bringing rumors
of the fight (P. O. Hutchinson's <i>Governor Hutchinson</i>, 489). The news was at once published from Whitehall
(Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>, 1775, p. 132; <i>Analectic Mag.</i>, 1818, p. 260; Force, iv.; Dawson, 361, and
his <i>Battles</i>, 65; Ellis, 94; Frothingham's <i>Siege</i>, 385; Moore's <i>Ballad History</i>, 86, etc.). Gage wrote at the
same time a private letter to Dartmouth. "The number", he says, "of killed and wounded is greater than we
could afford to lose, and some extraordinary good officers have been lost. The trials we have had show that
the rebels are not the despicable rabble too many have supposed them to be" (<i>London Gazette</i>, July 25; Force,
iv.; <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiv. 353; Dawson, 363). Burgoyne wrote the same day (June 25) a "letter to a
noble lord" (Stanley). He saw the action from Copp's Hill. We have the letter in two forms; the first in
Burgoyne's letter-book, where he calls it the "substance" of the letter, and in this form it is printed by E. D.
de Fonblanque in his <i>Political and Military Episodes derived from the life and correspondence of the Right
Hon. John Burgoyne, General, Statesman, Dramatist</i> (London, 1876), p. 153. In this draft he says that the
fight "establishes the ascendency of the king's troops, though opposed by more than treble numbers, assisted
by every circumstance that nature and art could supply to make a situation strong." This and other paragraphs,
as well as other forms of expression, do not appear in the letter as historians print it, as by Mahon
(vol. vi.), for instance, who, as Fonblanque supposes, had access to the letter actually received by Stanley. In
this latter form the letter appeared in London in the public prints (Sept.), and in a broadside with a plan of
the battle. It came back to Boston in this shape, and was printed in Hall's <i>New England Chronicle</i> (Cambridge,
Nov. 24), and in Edes's <i>Boston Gazette</i> (Watertown), and is now frequently met with (<i>Analectic Mag.</i>,
1815, p. 264; Ellis, p. 106, with comments from a London opposition journal; <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>,
xi. 125; Dawson, p. 363, and his <i>Battles</i>, p. 66; and in the Centennial publications of David Pulsifer and Samuel
A. Drake). Fonblanque adds something more of Burgoyne's view in letters (pp. 147, 193) which he wrote
to Lord Rochfort, without date, and to Lord George Germain (Aug. 20). In the former he said: "The
defence was well conceived and obstinately maintained; the retreat was no flight; it was even covered with
bravery and military skill."</p>
<p class="pfc4">Beside the Stanley letter of Burgoyne, we find also, written on June 25, two others: the first from Boston
to a gentleman in Scotland (Force, iv.; Dawson, 364); the second from an officer in Boston (Force, iv.; Dawson,
365).</p>
<p class="pfc4">On the 26th, Gage wrote to the Earl of Dunmore in Virginia (Force, iv.; Dawson, 366).</p>
<p class="pfc4">On July 5th, there is a letter from an officer in Boston (<i>Detail and Conduct of the American War</i>, 3d ed.,
1780, p. 12; Dawson, p. 367; Frothingham's <i>Siege</i>, 373).</p>
<p class="pfc4">A letter of Captain Harris, describing his receiving a wound and being taken from the field, is given without
date in Lushington's <i>Lord Harris</i> (p. 54; also Dawson, 366; Drake, 37). The Bunker Hill letter is
lacking in G. D. Scull's <i>Capt. Evelyn of the King's Own</i> (Oxford, 1879), but there is new matter in his <i>Evelyns
in America</i> (pp. 166-171, 278).</p>

The book passed to a second edition the same year. It was privately printed in New York in 1868, and
is included by S. A. Drake in his <i>Bunker Hill</i>, published in 1875 (Brinley, no. 1,786; Stevens, <i>Americana</i>,
1885, £3 3<i>s</i>).</p>

In 1793, when Stedman used the plate in his <i>American War</i>, he only altered the title, as Frothingham
says. In 1797 it was again reëngraved, but also with changes in the title, as <i>A plan of the action at Breed's
Hill, etc.</i>, and, as then reduced by D. Martin, it constitutes the earliest American engraved plan. It appeared
in C. Smith's <i>American War from 1775 to 1783</i> (New York, 1797), and Hunnewell (p. 18) gives a heliotype
of it. Nathaniel Dearborn, in his <i>Boston Notions</i>, engraved it, on a very small scale, in 1848; and the next
year (1849) Frothingham reproduced it in its original state in his <i>Siege</i>, and pointed out that the correspondence
of Montresor's survey to a recent survey of Felton and Parker inspired one with confidence in its accuracy
(<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xiv.). It is the basis of the best plans of the action, and is reproduced also in
Irving's <i>Washington</i>, illus. ed., ii. 467.</p>

Dearborn was at the time a captain in Stark's regiment, at the rail fence. Winthrop was on the field unattached.
Dr. Dexter looked on from the Malden shore of the Mystick. Kettell was a common soldier, at first
in the redoubt; then at the rail fence. Miller was at the rail fence.</p>

The figures in the town denote the numbers of the wards. The letters signify,&mdash;A, Town Hall; B, Old
meeting; C, the Chapel; D, Governor's house; E, Christ Church; F, Trinity Church; G, Faneuil Hall; H,
Old North meeting; I, Old South meeting; L, Work-house; M, Prison. A map like it appeared in 1782 in
a work of similar title to that published in Boston, but printed at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, being a second edition
of one printed at London in 1779. (Cf. Henry Stevens's <i>Hist. Coll.</i>, i. no. 435.) The whole design seems, however,
to be taken from a map which appeared in London, Sept. 2, 1775, whose main title is <i>Seat of War in
New England, by an American Volunteer, with the marches of the several Corps sent by the Colonies
towards Boston, with the Attack on Bunker Hill</i>; and which has in the margin a <i>Plan of Boston Harbor</i>,
and is also the prototype of the one in the <i>Impartial History</i> (Boston, 1781). Modern reproductions are also
given in Wheildon's <i>New History</i>, F. S. Drake's <i>Tea Leaves</i>, and in various other of the Centennial memorials
of 1875.</p>

and, in Harvard College library, that of Jeremiah Fogg (Winter Hill), Oct. 28, 1775, to Jan. 12, 1776. In the
Penna. Hist. Society is one kept at Cambridge, July 3 to Sept. 11, 1775; and another, also at Cambridge, Nov.
5, 1775, to Jan. 1, 1776, is in the Boston Public Library [H. 90 a, 9]. Two were sold in F. S. Drake's sale,
Boston, Nov., 1885, nos. 1,073, 1,074: one covering Feb. 1 to March 31, 1776; the other, Nov. 5 to Dec. 31,
1775. Glover's (June 29, etc.) is printed in the <i>Essex Inst. Hist. Coll.</i>, V. 112. That of Col. Israel Hutchinson,
Cambridge and Winter Hill, Aug. 13, 1775, to July 8, 1776, is in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, November, 1879.
Baldwin's, Jan. 5 to March 28, 1776, is at the State House, Boston, with a large mass of rolls, commissary and
other papers. Sullivan's brigade-book is in the library of the Mass. Hist. Soc. (<i>Proc.</i>, Oct., 1884, p. 250).
There are in the <i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, iv. 67, papers on the rank of the field-officers at Cambridge,
Nov., 1775; and in <i>Ibid.</i>, xxviii. 259, a list of the bodies of troops near Boston in 1775. The state of affairs
in and about Boston in 1774-75 is cleverly sketched in Winthrop Sargent's <i>Life of André</i>, ch. iv.,&mdash;that young
British officer being there at the time.</p>

The liberty-tree was cut down Sept. 1, 1775 (Moore's <i>Diary</i>, i. 131). There is a picture of it in <i>Mem.
Hist. of Boston</i>, iii. p. 159. The various houses occupied by the British generals are traced in <i>Ibid.</i>, iii. 155,
with references. Within our day, a cannon-ball imbedded in the tower of the Brattle Square Church has
attracted attention. A ball from the American lines struck there, and was afterwards fastened in the hole it
made, as a memorial. When the church was taken down, the ball was transferred to the cabinet of the Historical
Society (Loring's <i>Hundred Boston Orators</i>, 108; <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xx. 189; <i>Catal. Cab. Hist.
Soc.</i>, p. 141). The house of John Hancock was rather roughly used (<i>Mem. Hist. of Boston</i>, iii. 155).</p>

It was not procured from Paris till four years after the peace (Colonel Humphrey's letter, Nov., 1787, in
<i>Amer. Museum</i>, ii. 493). John Adams (<i>Familiar Letters</i>, 210) describes a device proposed for it, as early as
1776. It was purchased for the city of Boston in 1876, and is now preserved in the Boston Public Library.
Its history is given in the <i>Boston Evacuation Memorial</i>. It has been described and delineated, obverse and
reverse, several times, as in Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, i. 174, iii. 356; in Frothingham's <i>Siege</i> (cover); <i>Mem.

to the Cornell University library. They do not appear to be among the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> in Harvard College
library. This aspect of the siege of Boston is particularly studied in Lossing's <i>Field-Book of the Revolution</i>

and of his Captivity</i>, etc. (Burlington, 1849); as <i>Narrative of the Captivity</i>, etc. (Dayton, 1849). Cf. Sabin,
i. 793-800, 821. Allen's letter (May 11th) to the Massachusetts Congress is in Dawson's <i>Battles</i>, i. 38; and
another (May 10th) to Seth Warner is in the <i>Mag. of Am. Hist.</i>, 1885, p. 319. Various letters of Ethan
Allen at this time are among the <i>Trumbull Papers</i> (vol. iv.): to the Conn. Assembly, from Crown Point, May
26, 1775, covering a copy of his letter to the Indians (p. 96); to Governor Trumbull, July 6th and Aug. 3d.
His letter from Crown Point, June 2d, to the N. Y. Congress, is in Sparks's Gouverneur Morris, i. p. 54. Cf.
Lives of Allen by Sparks and by Hugh Moore; De Puy's <i>Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain heroes</i>;
Williams's <i>Vermont</i>. Dr. De Costa having, in the <i>Galaxy</i>, Dec., 1868 (also in his <i>Fort George</i>, p. 10), disputed
Allen's claim to the sole credit of the surprise, he was answered by Hiland Hall in a pamphlet, <i>The
Capture of Ticonderoga</i> (Montpelier, 1869; also in the <i>Vermont Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Oct. 19, 1869). Cf. Ira

Cf. Lives of Arnold by Sparks and by Isaac N. Arnold (ch. 2). The regimental memorandum-book of
Benedict Arnold, written while at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, is printed in the <i>Penna. Mag. of History</i>
(Dec., 1884), viii. 363, and separately. It begins May 10th and ends June 24th, and is published from a copy
made by W. H. B. Thomas before the original was lost. The <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (lii. vol. ii. p. 27) contain letters
from Arnold between 1775 and 1780, beginning with a letter from Crown Point, May 23, 1775, and ending with
a letter dated at Philadelphia, July 17, 1780, to Governor Huntington. There is a letter of Arnold from
Crown Point, June 13, 1775, in the <i>Trumbull Papers</i> (vol. iv. p. 111). Arnold was accused of countenancing
the robbery of Skene's house a few days before the capture, and some papers in his defence are given in Stevens's
<i>Bibliotheca Historica</i> (1870), no. 96. The original list of trophies of Ticonderoga, in Arnold's handwriting,
is in Dr. T. A. Emmet's Collection (Carrington's <i>Battles</i>). Cf. "Who took Ticonderoga?" in <i>Hist.
Mag.</i>, vol. xv. (Feb., 1869) p. 126. Arnold's appointment of May 3d, and his report of May 14th, are given
from the original documents in the possession of Jonathan Edwards, of N. Y., in Jones's <i>N. Y. during the
Rev.</i>, i. pp. 546-7.</p>

Jones (p. 49) sets forth the tergiversations of Duane and other New Yorkers (who had assisted a few
months before in proclaiming Allen an outlaw) as soon as the capture of Ticonderoga had made him the hero
of the hour. Depositions and other documents in the <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, iv., touch the riotous proceedings of
Allen, which had caused a price to be set on his head by the New York authorities. Cf. also Jones, <i>N. Y.
during the Rev.</i>, i. note xx.</p>

Cf. also Schuyler's letters in Sparks's <i>Correspondence of the Amer. Revolution</i> and Lossing's <i>Life of
Schuyler</i>, i. 310. Lossing also deals with the subject in his <i>Field-Book of the Revolution</i>, and in <i>Harper's
Monthly</i>, vol. xvii. p. 721. Chas. Carroll (<i>Journal to Canada</i>, 1876, p. 75) describes the ruinous condition of
Ticonderoga a year later. Reference may be made to Sparks's <i>Gouverneur Morris</i> (vol. i. ch. 4), and to the
general historians: Bancroft (orig. ed., vii. 338); Gay's <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i> (iii. ch. 17); Irving's <i>Washington</i>
(i. 404); and local histories, like Watson's <i>Essex County</i> (ch. 9); Palmer's <i>Lake Champlain</i>; Holden's
<i>Queensbury</i> (p. 405); Bourne's <i>Wells and Kennebunk, Me.</i>; Van Rensselaer's <i>Essays</i>; Poole's <i>Index</i>, etc.
A letter of Joseph Warren congratulating Connecticut on the event is in Frothingham's <i>Warren</i>, p. 490.
Another letter of Joseph Warren (Watertown, May 17, 1775) to John Scollay, being captured by Gage, gave
the British general the first intimation of the fall of Ticonderoga (<i>Sparks, MSS.</i>, xxxii.). Governor Franklin
communicates a diary at Ticonderoga, May 11-19, to Dartmouth (<i>N. Jersey Archives</i>, x. 608). Respecting
the condition of Ticonderoga after the capture, see Eliphalet Dyer's letter, May 31, 1775, in <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, vii.

Geo. W. Cullum, and an article by him in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, April, 1884, with interesting illustrations,
including (p. 277) a view of Montgomery Place, on the Hudson, which was building at the time of his death,
and was afterwards the home of his widow. There are other views of this well-known estate in Lamb's Homes
of America, <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, lxx. 354, etc. General Cullum's paper has also a fac-simile of a letter sent by
Montgomery to Colonel Bedel, Oct. 2, 1775. For the ancestry of Montgomery, see <i>N. Y. Geneal. and Biog.
Record</i>, July, 1871, p. 123. The memory of Montgomery suffered for a long time in Canada from the belief
that he was the officer of that name who was charged with atrocities during the siege of Quebec in 1759 (<i>Quebec
Lit. and Hist. Soc. Trans.</i>, 1870-71, p. 63).</p>
<p class="pfc4">On his death and burial, see, beside the usual accounts, a paper among the Belknap papers in Mass. Hist.

of his death in the <i>New Dominion Monthly</i> (Montreal), xvii. 397.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The tributes of Congress to Montgomery are recorded in the <i>Journals of Congress</i>, i. 247. Public services
took place before that body Feb. 19, 1776, when an address was delivered which was published as <i>An Oration
in Memory of General Montgomery, and of the Officers and Soldiers who fell with him, December 31, 1775,
before Quebec; drawn up (and delivered February 19th, 1776). At the Desire of the Honorable Continental
Congress. By William Smith, D. D., Provost of the College and Academy of Philadelphia</i> (Phila., 1776)
It was reprinted in Norwich, Conn., and in London twice in the same year.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Franklin was commissioned to procure in France a monument to Montgomery's memory. One was finally

prisoners at Quebec, Dec. 31, 1775. (Cf. list in <i>Ware's Journal</i>.) The N. Y. Continental line (four regiments
and one artillery company) was organized, under a vote of the N. Y. provincial congress, June 28, 1775, and
served on this campaign. Capt. John Lamb's artillery company left New York with seventy enlisted men, and

Wooster's share in the campaign was not a happy one. "His defect was his age", says C. F. Adams.
"Few of the brave officers in the French war sustained their reputation in the revolutionary struggle" (<i>Life
and Works of John Adams</i>, iii. 44). Lossing's <i>Schuyler</i> and Hollister's <i>Connecticut</i> have somewhat opposing
sympathies respecting Wooster's character. Cf. much in <i>4 Force's Archives</i>, iv., v., vi., and <i>5 Ibid.</i>, i. The
opinion upon Wooster of the Commissioners to Congress is shown in their letter of May 27th (<i>Force's Archives</i>,
vi. 589). There is a letter of Wooster from Montreal, Feb. 11, 1776, addressed to Roger Sherman, in
<i>Letters and Papers</i>, 1761-1776 (MSS. in Mass. Hist. Soc., p. 167). In this he speaks of his disagreements
with Schuyler, and says that his persuasion had prevented Montgomery from resigning.</p>

It is to be remembered that these positive
statements as to the spirit of independence latent
in the colonies were written after the achievement
of the fact. It is but fair to say that it has
been objected against the positiveness of Chalmers's
statements that he presents no specific
evidence of their truth from written authorities.
(See Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, vol. ii. Appendix x.,
and his Preface to the American edition of
Chalmers.) Viscount Bury, in his <i>Exodus of the
Western Nations</i> (i. 395, 412), repeats the opinion
of Chalmers as positively, yet also without
authorities. On the other side, as illustrating
how general statements may be affirmed, as if not
to be qualified or challenged, we read in Governor
Hutchinson's volume of his <i>History</i> written
during his exile in England this sentence (vol.
iii. p. 69), as of date 1758: "An empire, separate
or distinct from Britain, no man then alive expected
or desired to see",&mdash;an assertion more
rhetorical than true. In the debate in the Commons
on the Boston Port Bill and the infraction
of the charter of Massachusetts, Sir Richard
Sutton said "that even in the most quiet times
the disposition to oppose the laws of this country
was strongly ingrafted in the Americans, and
all their actions conveyed a spirit and wish for
independence. If you ask an American who is
his master, he will tell you he has none, nor
any governor, but Jesus Christ" (Adolphus, ii.
108).</p>

This Congress issued a very strong declaration
"of the causes and necessity of taking up
arms." It sought by clear statements "to quiet
the minds of our friends and fellow-subjects.
We do not mean to dissolve the union. Necessity
has not driven us into that desperate measure.
We have not raised armies with the ambitious
designs of separation from Great Britain,
and establishing independent states." This hesitating
and vacillating course of the first two
congresses would naturally encourage the British
ministry in the belief, first, that the colonists
were by no means of one mind as to valid reasons
for a united opposition to government; and
second, that the strength of the existing feelings
of loyalty and attachment, backed by efficient
policy, would withstand any looking towards independence.</p>

There is a slight conflict of testimony in private
records&mdash;for we have none that are official&mdash;as
to some of the details in the preparation
of the Declaration. John Adams, trusting to his
memory, wrote in his <i>Autobiography</i> (cf. <i>Works</i>,
ii. 512), twenty-eight years after the transaction,
and again in a letter to Timothy Pickering,
forty-seven years after it (cf. <i>Life of Pickering,</i>
iv. 463), and when he was in his eighty-eighth
year, substantially to the same effect, namely,
that Jefferson and himself were appointed by
their associates a sub-committee to make the
draft. Jefferson (<i>Mem. and Corresp.</i>, iv. 375),
on reading this letter, published in 1823, wrote
to Madison denying this statement, and making
another, relying on notes which he had made at
the time. He says there was no sub-committee,
and that when he himself had prepared the
draft he submitted it for perusal and judgment
separately to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams, each
of whom made a few verbal alterations in it.
These he adopted in a fair copy which he reported
to the committee, and on June 28th to
Congress, where, after the reading, it was laid
on the table. On July 1st Congress took up for
debate Mr. Lee's resolution for independence.
Nine colonies&mdash;New Hampshire, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia&mdash;voted
for the resolution. The two delegates of
Delaware were divided. South Carolina and
Pennsylvania voted against it. The New York
delegates affirmed that they approved it, but
that their instructions at present did not warrant
their voting for it; but on July 9th a New
York convention ratified it. Rutledge moved
for a day's delay, which being granted, South
Carolina accorded. A third delegate coming
by post from Delaware turned that colony to
the affirmative. Two substituted delegates from
Pennsylvania carried that province. The roll
of the thirteen colonies was now in union. On
the same day, July 2d, and the two days following,
Jefferson's draft was under debate, and was
amended in committee of the whole. The author
of the instrument leaves us to infer that
he sat in an impatient and annoyed silence
through the ordeal of criticism and objection
passed upon it. The two principal amendments
were the striking out a severe censure on "the
people of England", lest "it might offend some
of our friends there." and the omission of a
reprobation of slavery, in deference to South
Carolina and Georgia. When the committee
reported to Congress, such notes of the debates
as we have inform us, that, with much vehemence,
discordance, remonstrance, and pleadings
for delay, with doubts as to whether the
people were ready for and would ratify the
Declaration, it secured a majority of one in
the count of the delegates. Jefferson said that
John Adams was "the colossus" in that stirring
debate.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is no occasion here for a critical study
or estimate of the Declaration, either as a political
manifesto or as a literary production. Its
rhetoric, as we know, was at the first reading
of it regarded as excessive,&mdash;needlessly, perhaps
harmfully, severe. That has ever since
been the judgment of some. But Jefferson,
Franklin, and John Adams, men of three very
different types of mental energy and styles of
expressing themselves, accorded in offering the
document. The best that can be said of it is,
that it answered its purpose, was fitted to meet
a crisis and to serve the uses desired of it. Its
terse and pointed directness of statement, its
brief and nervous sentences, its cumulating
gathering of grievances, its concentration of
censure, and its resolute avowal of a decided
purpose, not admitting of temporizing or reconsideration,
were its effective points. Dating
from its passage by the Congress, and its confidently
assured ratification by the people, it
was to announce a changed relation and new
conditions for future intercourse between a now
independent nation and a repudiated mother
country. The resolve was sustained. Henceforward,
whatever proffers, threats, appeals of
amity, for readjustment of quarrels, or for harmony,
might come from king or Parliament, or
through commissioners, must proceed after the
diplomatic fashion, on the admission that the
negotiation was no longer between a government
and its revolted subjects, but between two
distinct sovereignties.</p>

It might be regarded as a matter of course
that no parliamentary or other official proceeding
or document of the British government would
recognize, by way of examination or controversy,
the crowning state paper of the American Congress.
Chagrin, contempt, vengeful feelings, or
a simple regard for its own dignity, may have
induced the government to assume indifference.
As yet the Declaration was a paper assertion
of what was not then secured. But the English
press was neither silent nor respectful about
the Declaration. An able pamphlet appeared
as <i>An Answer to the Declaration of the American
Congress</i> (London, 1776). Another pamphlet, at
first privately circulated, afterwards published,
was written by Governor Hutchinson, then in
England, entitled <i>Strictures on the late Declaration
of Congress</i>. It is reprinted anonymously in
Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>, iv. 25. The writer says
that the reasons given in the Declaration to justify
it are "false and frivolous." He sent a copy
of this pamphlet to the king, with an obsequious
letter. Adolphus, after saying "that at no preceding
period of history was so important a
transaction vindicated by so shallow and feeble
a composition", adds that "some passages are
remarkable for low and intemperate scurrility",
(vol. ii. 405, 406).</p>

A shining exception to the sweep of Judge
Jones's assertion is found in the case of that
gifted and eminent man, Dr. William Samuel
Johnson, first Senator in the Constitutional Congress
from Connecticut, and president of Columbia
College. Though not a clergyman, he had
been a lay reader in the Episcopal Church, as
inheriting from his distinguished father, and
accepting through his own convictions, its doctrine
and discipline. Strongly conservative, with
many fond ties to England and Englishmen
from long residence abroad as an agent of his
colony, he might naturally have espoused the
side of the mother country. Indeed, rather from
a suspicion that he would do so than from any
overt act of his, he was arrested on an occasion
of popular excitement, in 1779. But he proved
to be among the wisest and firmest of patriots.

On the records of the New York Provincial
Congress, or Convention, is a letter dated July
11, 1776, drafted by Gouverneur Morris, and addressed
to Hancock, president of the Continental
Congress, which contains the following
remarkable proposition: "We take the liberty
of suggesting to your consideration the propriety
of taking some measures for expunging
from the Book of Common Prayer such parts,
and discontinuing in the congregations of all
other denominations all such prayers, as interfere
with the interests of the American cause.
It is a subject we are afraid to meddle with.
The enemies of America have taken great pains
to insinuate into the minds of the Episcopalians
that the church is in danger. We could wish
that the Congress would pass some resolve to
quiet their fears, and we are confident it would
do essential service to the cause of America at
least in this State." Happily Hancock did not
act on this suggestion. Congress might indeed
have issued a revised edition of the English
Liturgy; but a censorship of the utterances of
extemporaneous prayers would have been beyond
its range. These extemporaneous devotions
were doubtless at the time sufficiently patriotic.</p>

See <i>The Pulpit of the American Revolution:
or, the Political Sermons of the Period of 1776</i>.
<i>With a Historical Introduction, Notes, and Illustrations.

<p class="pfc4">In the French Archives, among the papers of
Choiseul, prime minister of France before our
Revolutionary period, there are curious evidences
of the intelligent and keenly inquisitive method
which that astute statesman employed to acquaint
himself thoroughly with the relations of
the religious teaching and belief of the people of
New England and the spirit of liberty aroused
among them. He sent here a messenger to
gather information especially upon those as upon
many other subjects. He was to collect newspapers,
advertisements, and extracts from sermons.
It was inferences from such communicative
papers, with other interpretations of
omens and signs of the times, that helped prepare
the government for the alliance of 1778.
The French minister sent two emissaries, M. de
Fontleroy in 1764 and the Baron De Kalb in
1768. (See Kapp's <i>Life of John Kalb</i>.) The latter's
letters are copied in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> Cf.
the Vicomte de Colleville's <i>Les missions secrètes
du général-major baron de Kalb, et son rôle dans
la guerre de l'indépendance américaine</i> (Paris,

All that can be said in justification of
George III. is said by Mahon (vi. 100). The
fact is, that, with the exception of a few like
Dean Tucker and John Cartwright, the king's
subjects were, like himself, deceived for a long
time into believing that the loss of England's
colonies would cause her sun to set. It was
the king's obstinacy or "steadfastness", as you
choose to call it, which kept him longer of
that opinion than almost all of his subjects.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

An emphatic sentence from the pen of the
able and candid historian Lecky may be quoted
here. Referring to "the sullen and rancorous
nature of an intensity of hatred" towards Chatham,
which led the king, against all advice and
urgency, to refuse any aid from that noble statesman,
Lecky writes "This episode appears to
me the most criminal in the whole reign of
George III., and in my own judgment it is as
criminal as any of those acts which led Charles
I. to the scaffold" (<i>Hist. of Eng. in the XVIIIth
Cent.</i>, iv. 83).</p>

The Massachusetts refugee, Judge Curwen,
thus writes, in London, in 1780: "In this baneful,
woful quarrel, such a continued, unbroken
series of disappointments, disasters, and mortifying
events have taken place, that it seems to
me to be morally impossible but the eyes of all
thoughtful, prudent, knowing men must open
and discern the impolicy and impracticability of
accomplishing the great end for which this war
was undertaken,&mdash;the reduction of the colonies
to the obedience of the British Parliament"

There is something very significant as well as
comical in the following entry in John Adams's
Diary in Congress, in 1775, when he had made
his way to a full deliverance: "When these people
began to see that independence was approaching,
they started back. In some of my public
harangues, in which I had freely and explicitly
laid open my thoughts, on looking round the assembly,
I have seen horror, terror, and detestation
strongly marked on the countenances of some
of the members, whose names I could readily recollect;
but as some of them have been good citizens
since, and others went over afterwards to
the English, I think it unnecessary to record
them here" (<i>Works of John Adams</i>, ii. p. 407).
Mr. Sparks has gathered (<i>Washington</i>, Appendix
x. vol. ii.) the expressed opinions of such typical
patriots as Washington, Franklin, Henry,
Madison, Jay, etc., utterly and emphatically disavowing
all thoughts or purposes of independence
till the crisis made it a matter of necessity,
not of choice. It is but candid, however, to note
an anticipation of that acute observer Joseph Galloway,
whether it was but a surmise or a reasonable
inference. In a letter addressed by him, Jan.
13, 1766, to Dr. Franklin, in London, he writes:
"A certain sect of people, if I may judge from
all their late conduct, seem to look on this as a
favorable opportunity of establishing their republican
principles, and of throwing off all connection
with their mother country. I have reasons
to think that they are forming a private
union among themselves from one end of the
continent to the other" (Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, vii.
305). The assertion of John Jay is most explicit
and emphatic: "During the course of my life,
and until the second petition of Congress, in
1775, I never did hear any American of any class,
or any description, express a wish for the independence
of the colonies" (<i>Life and Writings of
John Jay</i>, ii. p. 410). Mr. Jay probably referred
to the contemptuous treatment of that second
petition, "Dickinson's Letter", not to its transmission.</p>

Before this decision was reached, however,
Congress, in 1774, made this tentative effort to
recognize the unity of the empire in the extending
through it of some sovereign power while
holding to a local independence, in this form:
"From the necessity of the case and a regard to
the mutual interests of both countries, we cheerfully
consent to the operation of such acts of the
British Parliament as are <i>bonâ fide</i> restricted to
the regulation of our external commerce, for the
purpose of securing the commercial advantages
of the whole empire to the mother country, and
the commercial benefits of its respective members,
excluding every idea of taxation, internal
and external, for raising a revenue, on the subjects
in America, without their consent." This
was a seemingly candid and sincere suggestion
to harmonize the positions taken by the respective
parties in the controversy. Britain, the mistress
of the seas, protected the great highways
of commerce, and so might regulate the trade of
her colonies by the ocean, as she did her own.
But these colonies had constitutional charter assemblies
with exclusive powers for raising and
disposing of their own revenues.</p>

A very significant reference to the mixed
qualities recognized in Paine by his contemporaries
is found in <i>Men and Times of the Revolution;
or Memoirs of Elkanah Watson</i>, etc. (New
York, 1856). Mr. Watson, a native of Plymouth,
was patriotic in his sentiments, and was on
mercantile business in Europe during the war,
honored with the friendship of Dr. Franklin and
John Adams in Paris. His brother, Benj. Marston
Watson, of Marblehead, was a noted loyalist.
(See a "Memoir" of him in <i>N. E. Hist.
and Geneal. Reg.</i>, Oct., 1873.) When Elkanah
was at Nantes in 1781, Paine arrived there as
secretary of Colonel Laurens, "and took up
his quarters at my boarding-place. He was
coarse and uncouth in his manners, loathsome in
his appearance, and a disgusting egotist. Yet I
could not repress the deepest emotions of gratitude
towards him, as the instrument of Providence
in accelerating the declaration of our independence.
He certainly was a prominent agent
in preparing the public sentiment of America for
that glorious event."</p>
<p class="pfc4">A very fair estimate of the qualities in Paine's
pamphlet which adapted it for popular effect is
the following, by the English historian Adolphus:
"His pamphlet was replete with rough,
sarcastic wit, and he took, with great judgment,
a correct aim at the feelings and prejudices of
those whom he intended to influence. Writing
to fanatics, he drew his arguments and illustrations
from the holy Scriptures; his readers,
having no predilection for hereditary titles, distinctions
to them unknown, received with applause
his invectives and sneers at hereditary
monarchy; a notion of increasing opulence, and
false calculations on their population and means
of prosperity, had rendered them arrogant and
self-sufficient, and consequently disposed them
to relish the arguments he employed to prove
the absurdity of subjugating a large continent to
a small island on the other side of the globe. To
inflame the resentment of the Americans, every
act of the British government towards them was
represented in the most ungracious light", etc.
(Adolphus, ii. 400). A most thoroughly candid
and discriminating estimate of the character and
abilities, the good and the bad elements in Paine,
may be found in a letter, not for publication, by
Joel Barlow to Cheetham, Paine's biographer
(<i>Life and Letters of J. Barlow</i>, by Charles Burr.
Todd, 1886, pp. 236-239). Cheetham meanly
published this letter.</p>

Dr. Josiah Tucker, Dean of Gloucester,
sought to be an oracle alike on its commercial
and political bearings. He had well informed
himself about the history and condition of the
colonies. He thought it a mistake that Britain
had broken the power of the French, and, by
withdrawing the threat of their presence over
the English colonists, had left them to set up
for independence. The idea that their disaffection
began with the Stamp Act he repudiated,
as disproved by their restiveness and truculency
from their first settlements, and from the occasion
there had always been for the interposition
of sharp measures of government for restraining
them. His opinion of their general character
was highly unfavorable, but he was thoroughly
satisfied with the impossibility of subduing them,
and even of the inexpediency of retaining a
forced relation to them. His advice was that
Britain should at once give over its attempts at
subjugation, and even acquiesce in leaving them
to take care and govern themselves, at least till
they should repent of their folly. He anticipated,
as the solution of wisdom, the complete
abandonment of any interference with the recusant
Americans, maintaining that the methods of
profitable commerce, which would secure English
interests and supremacy, would be more
effective than a fretting interference with them.
His views&mdash;which, looked at in the retrospect,
appear thoroughly sagacious&mdash;were, to most of
his contemporaries, either visionary or exasperating.
Tucker set forth the positive facts, that
while war was most ruinous to the interests of
commerce, those interests ought to serve to the
security of peace. The war of England against
the Spanish right of search had won no benefit,
but had added sixty millions sterling to the debt
of the realm. The late French war had cost
ninety millions more, and by relieving the colonists

not go beyond English precedents for any of the sentiments of the day. For the bibliography of <i>Common

German, and in the same year (1776) reprinted in Salem, Newburyport, Providence, Boston, Norwich, Newport,
New York, Charleston, and also in London and Edinburgh, and is included in Paine's <i>Writings</i> (Albany,
1791-92; Charlestown, Mass., 1824; New York, 1835, etc.) A volume of <i>Large Additions to Common Sense</i>
(Philad. and London, 1776, etc.) was got up by Robert Bell to extend his edition over that of Paine's then
publisher (Hildeburn, no. 3,439; Brinley, ii. no. 4,100). Frothingham (p.476) has a bibliographical note. It
is included in a French <i>Recueil des divers écrits</i> of Paine (Paris, 1793).</p>

in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, ii. 59. Sabin (xv. p. 176) says it was probably by Jos. Galloway; but there is no
evidence of it. Hildeburn (no. 3,345) gives reasons for assigning it to George Chalmers. It passed to a second

After Germain had written out Howe's orders,

in his account of General Philip Schuyler, points
out some errors of a personal nature, into which
Lossing and Judge Jones have fallen, respecting
Schuyler's private history. For the Schuyler
family, see <i>N. Y. Geneal. and Biog. Record</i>,
April, 1874.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Schuyler's house in Albany, at which he entertained
Burgoyne after his surrender, is shown

Irwin's <i>Worthy Women of our First Century</i>

The total losses in this campaign of the
Anglo-British army were: British prisoners,
2,442; foreign prisoners, 2,198; General Burgoyne
and staff officers (including six members
of Parliament), 12; sent to Canada, 1,100; sick
and wounded, 598; making the total surrendered,
October 17, 1777, to be 6,350. Then there
were taken prisoners before the surrender, 400;
deserters, 300; lost at Bennington, 1,220; killed
between September 17 and October 17, 1777,
600; taken at Ticonderoga, 413; killed at Oriskany,
300; giving an entire loss of 3,233,&mdash;which,
with those surrendered, make a total loss
of 9,583.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Besides the <i>personnel</i>, there were lost in the
campaign, 6 pieces of cannon at Bennington; 2
pieces and 4 royals at Fort Stanwix; 400 set of
harness; a number of ammunition wagons and
horses; 5,000 stand of arms; 37 pieces of brass
cannon, implements and stores complete, camp

Captain John Montressor, a British "Chief
Engineer of America" in the Revolution, who
was with Putnam under Colonel Bradstreet in
1764, goes so far as to intimate (very likely without
warrant) a still stronger reason for the general's
inefficiency at Long Island and in the
Hudson Highlands. In his journal (page 136),
published by the New York Historical Society,
1882, speaking of the venality of the American
"Rebel Generals", he says "Even Israel Putnam,
of Connecticut, might have been bought,
to my certain knowledge, for <i>one dollar per day</i>."</p>

The <span class="smcap">Articles</span> of Oct. 16, 1777, were as follows, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">"I. The troops, under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, to march out of their camp with the honors of war

artillery are to be left; the arms to be piled by word of command from their own officers.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"II. A free passage to be granted to the army, under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, to Great Britain, on condition
of not serving again in North America during the present contest; and the port of Boston is assigned
for the entry of transports to receive the troops whenever General Howe shall so order.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"III. Should any cartel take place, by which the army under General Burgoyne, or any part of it, may be
exchanged, the foregoing article to be void as far as such exchange shall be made.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"IV. The army under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne to march to Massachusetts Bay, by the easiest, most
expeditious, and convenient route; and to be quartered in, near, or as convenient as possible to Boston, that
the march of the troops may not be delayed when transports arrive to receive them.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"V. The troops to be supplied on their march, and during their being in quarters, with provisions by General
Gates's orders, at the same rate of rations as the troops of his own army; and if possible, the officers' horses
and cattle are to be supplied with forage at the usual rates.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"VI. All officers to retain their carriages, bat-horses, and other cattle, and no baggage to be molested or
searched; Lieutenant-General Burgoyne giving his honor that there are no public stores secreted therein.
Major-General Gates will of course take the necessary measures for the due performance of this article.
Should any carriages be wanted during the march, for the transportation of officers' baggage, they are, if possible,
to be supplied by the country at the usual rates.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"VII. Upon the march, and during the time the army shall remain in quarters in Massachusetts Bay, the
officers are not, as far as circumstances will admit, to be separated from their men. The officers are to be
quartered according to rank, and are not to be hindered from assembling their men for roll-call and other
necessary purposes of regularity.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"VIII. All corps whatever of General Burgoyne's army, whether composed of sailors, bateau-men, artificers,

sense and utmost extent of the above articles, and comprehended in every respect as British subjects.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"IX. All Canadians, and persons belonging to the Canadian establishment, consisting of sailors, bateau-men,
artificers, drivers, independent companies, and many other followers of the army, who come under no
particular description, are to be permitted to return there; they are to be conducted immediately by the shortest
route to the first British port on Lake George, are to be supplied with provisions in the same manner as
the other troops, and are to be bound by the same condition of not serving during the present contest in North
America.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"X. Passports to be immediately granted for three officers, not exceeding the rank of captains, who shall
be appointed by Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, to carry despatches to Sir William Howe, Sir Guy Carleton,
and to Great Britain by way of New York; and Major-General Gates engages the public faith that these
despatches shall not be opened. These officers are to set out immediately after receiving their despatches,
and are to travel the shortest routes and in the most expeditious manner.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"XI. During the stay of the troops in Massachusetts Bay, the officers are to be admitted on parole, and
are to be allowed to wear their side arms.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"XII. Should the army under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne find it necessary to send for their clothing and
other baggage to Canada, they are to be permitted to do it in the most convenient manner, and the necessary
passports granted for that purpose.</p>
<p class="pfc4">"XIII. These Articles are to be mutually signed, and exchanged to-morrow morning at nine o'clock, and
the troops under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne are to march out of their intrenchments at three o'clock in

A letter of Glover about the march, dated Cambridge, Jan. 27, 1778, is in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (lii. vol. iii.).
The line of their march is shown in Anburey's <i>Travels</i>. Mrs. Hannah Winthrop's letter, Nov. 11, 1777,
describing the entry of Burgoyne's army into Cambridge, is cited in Mrs. Ellet's <i>Women of the Revolution</i>,
i. 96. A journal of the Northern campaign of 1777 (Oct. 6th to Nov. 9th), at which last date the writer
"attended Mr. Burgoyne to Boston", is among the Langdon Papers, copied in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (lii. vol. ii.).
The commander of the Eastern department at this time was Gen. Heath (Heath's <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 134; <i>Hist.
Mag.</i>, iii. 170; <i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>, iii. 183). Letters of Burgoyne to Heath are in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>,
1885, p. 482, etc. A letter of Burgoyne (copy) to the president of Congress, dated at Cambridge, Feb. 11,
1778, is in <i>Letters and Papers, 1777-1780</i> (MSS. in Mass. Hist. Soc.). Burgoyne preferred charges against
Capt. David Henley, an officer of the guard, for cruel behavior towards the prisoners. He was tried and
acquitted. <i>An Account of the Proceedings of a Court Martial held at Cambridge by order of Maj. General
Heath for the trial of Col. David Henley, taken in short hand by an officer who was present</i>, was published
in London, 1778. The trial lasted from Jan. 20 to Feb. 25, 1778. The proceedings were also printed in Boston
(<i>Brinley Catal.</i>, nos. 4,024-25). The trial is epitomized in P. W. Chandler's <i>Amer. Criminal Trials</i> (ii. 59).
There are jottings about the influence of the prisoners in Boston at the time in Ezekiel Price's diary in the
<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, October, 1865. The orders of Burgoyne issued in Cambridge are given in <i>Hadden's
Journal</i>. Gen. Phillips commanded the convention troops after Burgoyne's departure. There are letters
of Phillips in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, July, 1885, p. 91. The parole which the English and German officers
signed, to keep within certain limits of territory, is in the Boston Public Library (Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii.
878, and <i>Burgoyne's Orderly-Book</i>). There are details of their life in Cambridge in Schlözer's <i>Briefwechsel</i>
(iv. 341); the memoirs of Riedesel and Madame Riedesel; and in Eelking's <i>Hülfstruppen</i>. Cf. Lossing's
<i>Field-Book</i>; Drake's <i>Landmarks of Middlesex</i>; and Mrs. Ellet's <i>Domestic Hist. of the Amer. Rev.</i> (N. Y.,

Lafayette told Sparks that there was the strongest circumstantial evidence that the British intended to
take the troops, not to England, but to New York, the vessels not being provisioned for an Atlantic voyage,
and that they claimed justification in this purpose because the Americans had themselves broken the convention.
He also added that the British government would not ratify the convention, because they could not
keep faith with rebels.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Much of the correspondence about the detention is copied in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>, no. lviii., part 2. The English
files are in the War Office, London, in the collection "Quebec and Canada, 1776-1780;" and other papers

There is a map of their route and a view of their encampment at this place in Anburey's <i>Travels</i>, which
last is reproduced in Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 552. Cf. also the print as published by Wm. Lane, London,
Jan. 1, 1789 (<i>Catal. Cab. Mass. Hist. Soc.</i>, p. 89, no. 612). The command of the encampment in Virginia
was given to Col. Theodorick Bland, Jr., and copies of some of his papers are in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (no. xli.).
The <i>Bland Papers</i>, edited by Chas. Campbell, were published at Petersburg, 1840-43. Accounts of the troops'
sojourn in Virginia are given by Anburey, Riedesel, and Eelking. Cf. also Jefferson's <i>Writings</i> (i. 212); lives
of Jefferson, by Tucker (i. ch. 5), Randall (i. 232, 285), and Parton (p. 222); Howison's <i>Virginia</i> (ii. 250);
Lowell's <i>Hessians</i>. On October 26, Jefferson had urged upon Washington the removal of the convention
troops, as it might not be possible to protect them in case of an invasion of Virginia (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, lxvi.).
In November the English troops were removed to Fort Frederick. Large numbers deserted (Sparks's <i>Corresp.
of the Rev.</i>, ii. 324).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Among the Sparks maps at Cornell University are two sheets showing the Hudson River with soundings,
in part at high tide and in part at half tide. They are each thirty inches long, and appear to be by the same
draftsman. One of them is indorsed: "Drawn by the request and under the inspection of the Commissioners
of Fortifications in the Highlands, Province of New York, by <span class="smcap">John Grenell</span>." One shows Haverstraw Bay
and Tappan Bay to a point above Dobbs Ferry, and indicates the site of Tarrytown. The other extends from
Stony Point to "Polyphemes Island", below Newburgh. Constitution Island is called "Martler's Rock;"
and beside Bunn's house, there is indicated at that point the block house, a "curtain fronting the river,
mounting fourteen cannon", the wharf, barracks, storehouse, and commissioner's room, and landing place.
West Point is opposite, unoccupied, and Moore's house is above. Fort Montgomery and a higher battery
is delineated at "Poop Lopes Kill", and from it along the river towards West Point is the inscription: "By
good information there is a waggon road from Poop Lopes Kill to West Point."</p>
<p class="pfc4">Another sheet contains "a plan of a fort proposed on the east of Fort Constitution, laid down by scale of
twenty feet to an inch per Isaac Nicoll", and indorsed "Received May 10, 1776." Another has a distant
view of fortifications, topping a range of hills, and is marked "Fort Montgomery." It is not clear what is
meant by it.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is in the same collection "A rough map of Fort Montgomery, showing the situation on Puplopes [<i>sic</i>]
Point; ground plot of the buildings, etc., etc., Pr. T. P. No. 2", which is indorsed also "Plan of the works
at Fort Montgomery, May 31, 1776, no. 2." Mr. Sparks has written upon the original draft, "For an explanation
see Ld. Stirling's letter to Washington, dated June 1, 1776."</p>
<p class="pfc4">There are likewise two plans in colors among the Sparks maps at Cornell University, marked "No. 1"
and "No. 3", which seem to have been made in 1776. The first shows the Hudson River from Stony Point to
Constitution Island. West Point, which is opposite, is not named. It bears no indorsement and no names,
but in one corner is a profile view of the bank in the neighborhood apparently of Peekskill. The works on Constitution
Island are indicated, and Sparks has noted on it, "See Ld. Stirling's letter to Washington, June 1,
1776." The other plan shows the neighborhood of Fort Constitution (opposite West Point) on a larger scale,
a sketch of which, reduced, is given herewith and marked "Constitution Island, 1776." Cf. the map from
the <i>American Archives</i> in Boynton's <i>West Point</i>, p. 26.</p>

For this period see 4 Force, vol. v.; Heath's <i>Memoirs</i>; Sparks's <i>Gouverneur Morris</i> (i. ch. 5); lives of
Putnam; Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>; histories of New York, city and province. There is much of detail with
references in Dawson's <i>Westchester County, during the American Revolution</i> (Morrisania, 1886), p. 159, etc.,
particularly as respects the political influence of the provincial congress and the treatment of suspected persons.
This book, for the period covered by it, is one of the thoroughest pieces of work respecting the history
of the Revolution; but it is unfortunately marred by a captious and carping spirit, so characteristic of Dawson's
historical work. This monograph is a separate issue of a portion of a <i>History of Westchester County</i>, by
several hands.</p>

as <i>A Chart of the Entrance of Hudson's River from Sandy Hook to New York, with the banks, etc.</i> (London,
Sayer and Bennett, June 1, 1776). One was made in 1779 by Robert Erskine; and another is contained

Known as the Hickey Plot. It is detailed in the <i>Minutes of the trial and examination of certain persons
in the Province of New York, charged with being engaged in a conspiracy against the authority of the
Congress and the liberties of America</i> (London, 1786,&mdash;Menzies, no. 1,400), which was reprinted (100 copies)
as <i>Minutes of Conspiracy against the liberties of America</i>, at Philadelphia in 1865. The ringleader was one
of Washington's life guard, Thomas Hickey, who was hanged in June, 1776. David Matthews, the mayor
of New York, was implicated, and Governor Tryon was charged with a knowledge of the plot. Matthews was
arrested and confined in Connecticut (<i>Orderly-book of Sir John Johnson</i>, 214, 215). Cf. <i>N. Y. in the Rev.</i>

testimony, and the examination of Howe's statements (p. 471) from the <i>Detail and Conduct of the Amer.
War</i> (3d ed., 1780, p. 17). There were mutual criminations by Howe and the war minister, Lord George
Germain. Cf. Stedman, i. 193; Smyth's <i>Lectures on Modern Hist.</i> (Bohn ed., ii. 463-65); <i>Parliamentary
Reg.</i>, xi. 340; Almon's <i>Debates</i>, xii.; Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>, iii. A loyalist's view of the opportunity lost in
not forcing the American lines is in Jones's <i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i>, i. 112. Johnston (p. 185) points out how
the English did the real fighting, while the Hessians joined in the pursuit. Major James Wemys, an officer
of the British army serving in America, dying in New York in 1834-35, left papers, which were copied by
Sparks while in the hands of Rev. Wm. Ware (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, xx.). They include his estimates of various
generals of the British army; strictures on the peculations of some of them; including criticisms of Howe's
conduct in the fights at Long Island, Whiteplains, and Trenton.</p>

Respecting the retreat, Washington had ordered Heath (5 Force, i. 1211) to send down boats from up the
Hudson, which he did (Heath, <i>Memoirs</i>, 57). Washington's reasons for a retreat are told in a letter of Joseph
Reed, Aug. 30th, to Wm. Livingston, given in Sedgwick's <i>Livingston</i>, 201. (Cf. Sparks, <i>Washington</i>, iv. 81.)
Johnston collates the authorities upon the reasons (p. 215), and thinks Gordon's account the most probable,
that the American lines were unfit to stand siege operations, which Howe had begun. The proceedings of the
council of war (Aug. 29th) which decided upon the retreat are in 5 Force, i. 1246, and in Onderdonk's <i>Rev.
incidents in Suffolk County</i>, p. 161.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Bancroft (final revision, v. 38) and Wm. B. Reed (<i>Life of Jos. Reed</i>, i. 121-126) are at issue upon the point
whether the lifting of the fog, which revealed the purpose of the English ships to get between Brooklyn and
New York, took place before the retreat was ordered, or after it was nearly over. Bancroft's witnesses seem
conclusive against the claim of W. B. Reed that such a revelation induced Joseph Reed to urge the retreat
upon Washington (note in Bancroft, orig. ed., ix. 106; final revision, v. 38). Joseph Reed's own account is in
Sedgwick's <i>Livingston</i>, 203. Cf. Johnston, ch. 5. Col. Tallmadge (<i>Memoirs</i>, p. 11) says that Washington
never received the credit which was due to him for his wise and fortunate retreat from Long Island.</p>

28; Johnston, 195-201, and Docs., p. 167, 176, 180; De Lancey in Jones's <i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i>, 600. There
is a MS. on the prisoners taken noted in the <i>Bushnell Catal.</i> (1883), no. 791. Lecky (<i>England in the XVIIIth
Century</i>, iv. 2, N. Y. ed.) says: "The English and American authorities are hopelessly disagreed about the
exact numbers engaged, and among the Americans themselves there are very great differences. Compare Ramsay,
Bancroft, Stedman, and Stanhope, [Mahon]."</p>

The earliest special treatment is Samuel Ward in <i>Battle of Long Island</i> (1839; also see <i>Knickerbocker
Mag.</i>, xiii. 279). Field's monograph makes vol. ii. of the <i>Memoirs of the Long Island Hist. Soc.</i>, and nearly
half the volume is an appendix of documents. <i>The Campaign of 1776 round New York and Brooklyn</i> (Brooklyn,
1878), by Henry P. Johnston, makes vol. iii. of the same series, and chapter 4 is given to the subject, and
his narrative is well fortified by documentary proofs. In placing the responsibility of the defeat, he takes issue
(p. 192) with Bancroft, Field, and Dawson, who charge it upon Putnam. Dawson (<i>Battles</i>, i. 143) gives numerous
references. Carrington's <i>Battles of the Amer. Rev.</i> (ch. 31 and 32).</p>

Smith tells us that in 1766 a line of palisades, with block-houses, still stretched across New York Island,
near the line of the present Chambers St., which had been built in the French war, at a cost of about £8,000.
Crèvecœur described the town in 1772, and his description is translated in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, ii. 748.
Cf. Dawson's account in his <i>New York during the Revolution</i>. There are various views of the town during
the revolutionary period. One from the southeast and another from the southwest, by P. Canot, 1768, are reëngraved
in Hough's translation of Pouchot (ii. 85, 88). Cf. <i>Doc. Hist. N. Y.</i>, octavo, ii. 43. There are others
in the travels of Sandby and Kalm. See Moore's <i>Diary of the Amer. Rev.</i>, p. 311; Valentine's <i>Manual</i>, 1852,
p. 176; Appleton's <i>Journal</i>, xii. 464. A view of New York as seen from the bay, found among Lord Rawdon's
papers, is given in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, xlvii. p. 23. Gaine's <i>N. Y. Pocket Almanac</i>, 1772, has "Prospect
of the City of N. Y." A bird's-eye view of the island, as seen from above Fort Washington in 1781, is in
Valentine's <i>Manual</i>, 1854. This last publication contains various views of revolutionary landmarks, a
of Hellgate (1850,&mdash;cf. <i>London Mag.</i>, April, 1778); the Battery and Bowling Green (1858, p. 633); the
City Hall (1856, p. 32; 1866, p. 547); the Beekman house, headquarters of Sir William Howe in Sept., 1776
(1861, p. 496,&mdash;see also Gay, <i>Pop. Hist. U. S.</i>, iii. 503); the Rutgers mansion (1858, p. 607); Lord Stirling's
house (1854, p. 410); Alexander Hamilton's house (1858, p. 468). Knyphausen's quarters in Wall St.
are shown in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, June, 1883, p. 409.</p>

The original map is entitled <i>A Plan of the Operations of the king's army under the command of General
Sir William Howe, K. B., in New York and East New Jersey against the American forces commanded by
General Washington from the 12th of October to the 28th of Nov., 1776, wherein is particularly distinguished
the engagement on the White Plains, the 28th of October, by Claude Joseph Sauthier</i>. <i>Engraved by Wm.
Faden, 1777. Published Feb. 25, 1777.</i> The original MS. draft is among the Faden maps (library of Congress),
no. 58. The engraved map is given in fac-simile in Dawson's <i>Westchester County</i>, p. 227. The
direction of the American movements is indicated by arrows on the broken line (&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;), and triple
lines ≡ mark camps and positions. The British marches are shown by line and dot (&mdash;·&mdash;·&mdash;·) and their
camps by <span class="large">□</span>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The American army extended from Fort Washington to Kingsbridge, when Howe began a movement to
threaten their communications with the upper country. Leaving Percy to cover New York at McGowan's Pass,
near Bloomingdale (A), the British embarked at Turtle Bay, Harlem, and Long Island (B) in detachments
which landed at Frog's Neck (D, under cover of the "Carysfoot", man-of-war, C) on Oct. 12, 16, and 17, when
the Americans (at E) on the 12th broke down the bridge in their front across the marsh, and retired part
towards Kingsbridge and part towards New Rochelle. A MS. "Survey of Frog's Neck and the route of the
British army to the 24th of Oct., 1776, by Charles Blaskowitz", on a scale of 2,000 feet to an inch, is among
the Faden maps (no. 57) in the library of Congress. The British now proceeded farther by water to Pell's
Point (F), where they landed Oct. 18, and pushing forward had the same day a skirmish with the retiring
Americans (H), and still farther pursued them and occupied the lower bank at Mamaroneck (M) while the
Americans held the opposite bank, Oct. 22. That same day, Knyphausen with his Germans landed at
Myer's Point (G), and moving forward took ground (at K), and remained there from Oct. 22 to 28, while close
by (at J) the main body from Pell's Point were already in camp (Oct. 18-21), when, on the 21st, they moved
forward and encamped under Heister and Clinton (at L), where they remained till Oct. 25, and then proceeded
to N, where they stayed till Oct. 28.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Meanwhile, the Americans (at Z) had passed Kingsbridge, breaking it down after their passage, and then
dividing into two detachments. One of these proceeded and occupied the ridge of land from X to the White
Plains, intrenching at intervals along the summit running parallel to Bronx River. The other division
proceeded north through Wepperham, and both reunited Oct. 25 within the lines at White Plains (Q). The
British (at N) advanced on the same day, and formed, Oct. 28, opposite the American lines (at O), while
on the same day Leslie attacked the American corps of Spencer (at P), and Oct. 29 the Americans occupied
the lines at R, and Nov. 1 fell back across the Croton River. During Oct. 30, a part of Percy's force from
Bloomingdale had come up, leaving the road as they came north at N, and joining the left of the British line,
in place of the troops which after the fight of the 28th had encamped at S. The British now marched, part
direct and part by Tarrytown, to Dobbs Ferry (T), where they were in camp Nov. 6, and proceeding south
they were at U, Nov. 13. Dawson, <i>Westchester County</i>, 239, points out some errors in the names in this map,
which were allowed to stand in Stedman's map, and in the first edition of Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>. On the
American side there is a <i>Plan of the Country from Frog's Point to Croton River, showing the positions
of the American and British armies from the 12th of Oct., 1776, until the engagement on the White Plains
on the 28th</i>, drawn by S. Lewis from the original surveys made by order of Washington, and published in
1807. It has been reproduced in Dawson's <i>Westchester County</i>, from the original edition of Marshall's
<i>Washington</i>. Later eclectic plans can be found in the <i>Life of Washington</i>, by Sparks; in Hamilton's <i>Republic
of the United States</i>, i. 132; and in Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 820-826.</p>

London, 1779, known to be the work of Israel Mauduit, though published anonymously. It included Howe's
despatch. In this he criticises Howe severely, as well as in his <i>Three Letters to Lt.-Gen. Sir William Howe</i>
(London, 1781), with an appendix and map. When the brothers Howe, general and admiral, were appointed,
it was Hutchinson's opinion (<i>Diary</i>, ii. 40) that "no choice could have been more generally satisfactory to the
kingdom." Hutchinson (<i>Ibid.</i>, ii. 121) at this time speaks of a letter from Major Dilkes (Nov. 3) describing
the series of actions, in which he calls White Plains the principal one, and adds, "Though the king's troops had
the advantaged pursuing them, it does not appear that the loss was much different." Stedman's account is
in his ch. 7, and Eelking's in ch. 2 of his <i>Hülfstruppen</i>. Lowell in his <i>Hessians</i> uses several German accounts.</p>

<span class="smcap">Johnston's Map.</span>&mdash;Percy advancing from McGowan's Pass (T), the several American outposts withdrew
from Snake Hill (V), Harlem Plains (D D), and across the hollow way (U), and under Cadwallader
resisted for a while the attack of Percy at W, till Lt.-Col. Stirling, dispatched from the redoubt at F F, and
landing at X, threatened to intercept Cadwallader, when the Americans fell back to the lines above Fort
Washington. Meanwhile, two columns of attack approached the fort from the other side. Cornwallis, embarking
at Kingsbridge (B B), went down Harlem River and landed at A A, under cover of batteries at
F F, and there attacked Col. Baxter at the redoubts, who retreated to the fort. Knyphausen and Rall, advancing
also from Kingsbridge (B B) to Z, attacked Col. Rawling at Y, who also retreated to the fort. The
immediate outworks being carried on all sides, the fort surrendered Nov. 16, 1776.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><span class="smcap">Sauthier-Faden Plan.</span>&mdash;On the day of the fight at White Plains, Oct. 28, Knyphausen had left his
camp (at K), and marching west had crossed above Kingsbridge; and had encamped, Nov. 2, at W. The
Waldeck regiment stationed at New Rochelle had also marched, and Nov. 4 were at V, and then proceeded towards
Wepperham. The same day a portion of the British under Grant, coming south from Dobbs Ferry, had
left the main line at 4 and proceeded to 5 and 6, continuing their march next day to 7. The American outposts
on Tetard's Hill withdrew to the works about Fort Washington, when Knyphausen threatened to cut them
off. The siege and capture of Fort Washington now followed. This accomplished, Cornwallis embarked a
part of his force at "Spiting Devil Creek" and part at 8, united them on landing, Nov. 18, at 1, and encamped
that night at 2, the garrison of Fort Lee having already fled towards 3, whither Cornwallis followed them.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><span class="smcap">Note to the opposite Map.</span>&mdash;This sketch follows <i>A topographical map of the north part of New
York Island, exhibiting the plan of Fort Washington, now Fort Knyphausen, with the rebel lines to the

1776, and surveyed immediately after by order of his lordship by Claude Joseph Sauthier, to which is added
the attack made to the north by the Hessians, surveyed by order of Lieut.-Gen. Knyphausen</i>. London,
Wm. Faden, March 1, 1777.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The broken lines (&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;) represent roads. The Hessians advanced from Westchester County by Kingsbridge,
under Knyphausen, with detachments of his corps, the brigade of "Raille", and the regiment of
Waldeck. They crossed the little stream L in two columns. That of Raille's [Rall, Rahl] mounted the
hill, forced the battery of twelve-pounders and howitzers at H, and was joined before G by Knyphausen's column,
which had followed up the stream. Both pushed on and carried the works at A. The British light
infantry under Brig.-Gen. Matthews, to be supported by the grenadiers and 33d regiment under Cornwallis,
landed at B under cover of batteries at E, whereupon the Americans on the hill at J retired to the main works.
The 42d regiment under Lt.-Col. Stirling, with two battalions of the second brigade, crossed the river by the
dot and dash line (·&mdash;·&mdash;) and landed at C as a feint, and advanced by the battery M. Earl Percy with a
brigade of English and another of Hessians left the advanced posts of the British at McGowan's Pass, and
following the main road (&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;) forced the successive American lines through their abatis (× × × ×)
and attacked at D. Philip's or Dightman's bridge is at F. The British vessel "Pearl" at K assisted the
attack at A. The buildings marked <i>a</i> were barracks erected for winter-quarters by the Americans, but burned
by them when the British landed at Frog's Neck.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Sauthier's plan is included in <i>The American Atlas</i>, no. 23, and in Stedman (i. 210). Three MS. plans of
the attack on Fort Washington, one of them surveyed by Sauthier on the day of the attack by order of Lord

<p class="pfc4">G. W. Greene, in his <i>Life of Gen. Greene</i>, as it was the first military mistake of that officer, is at pains
to treat the history of the siege at considerable length, enlarging upon antecedent events (i. ch. 10 and 11).
Greene had urgently claimed that it was advisable to attempt to hold the fort, and letters giving his reasons
are in Sparks's <i>Corresp. of the Rev.</i>, i. 297, and Drake's <i>Knox</i>, 33. G. W. Greene holds that Gen. Greene
had a right to expect a better defence, and championed his ancestor in a tract against the criticisms of Bancroft
(Greene's <i>Greene</i>, ii. 431, 470), who put the responsibility of the disaster upon Green's persistent refusal
to evacuate the fort. This Bancroft maintains in his original edition, and in his final revision, where, however,
he recognizes, but does not deem essential to the British success, the treachery of Magaw's adjutant, William
Demont. There had been an intimation in Graydon's <i>Memoirs</i> that Howe had been helped by some kind of
faithlessness in the American ranks. In February, 1877, in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i> (i. 65, 756), Mr. E. F.
De Lancey first made public a letter of Demont written in 1792, in which he acknowledged having carried the
plans of the fort to Percy, "by which the fortress was taken", and this information is thought to have induced
Howe to make his sudden withdrawal from Washington's front at White Plains. De Lancey's paper was published
separately as <i>Capture of Mount Washington, 1776, the result of treason</i> (New York, 1777), and he
repeated the story in the notes (i. p. 626) to Jones's <i>N. Y. during the Rev. War.</i> Johnston (p. 283) doubts
if this treachery was decisive of the result. Cf. further in lives of Washington by Marshall and Irving (ii. ch.
38, 40); Reed's <i>Joseph Reed</i> (i. ch. 13); and a paper by W. H. Rawle on the part taken by Col. Lambert Cadwalader,

The catalogue of the <i>Brit. Mus. additional MSS.</i> (no. 31,537) refers to a similar map. See the map in
<i>The North American Atlas</i> (1777). The original MS. draft of the map engraved by Faden is in the library
of Congress (Faden collection, no. 21). There are maps of the lake in <i>Wayne's Orderly-Book</i>, and in
Palmer's <i>Lake Champlain</i>. An elaborate survey of Lake Champlain, made in 1778-1779, one inch to the
mile, is also among the Faden maps (no. 64,&mdash;the library of Congress).</p>

It was printed in the <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, April, 1778. In the appendix of Fonblanque's <i>Burgoyne</i> it has the
king's comments on it, and it was given in this way from a manuscript in the royal hand in Albemarle's
<i>Rockingham and his Contemporaries</i> (ii. 330). Lord Geo. Germain's instructions to Carleton relative to the
campaign are in the <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, Feb., 1778. The <i>Gent. Mag.</i> (Oct., 1777, p. 472) warned the public of the
difficulties which Burgoyne must expect to encounter.</p>

Comment from a British officer is in Anburey's <i>Travels</i>. Lecky (iv. 31) shows the way in which the army
was raised. The organization of the army is explained in a chapter in <i>Hadden's Journal</i>. The details of
the dispatching of troops are embraced in the volume "Secretary of State, 1776", War Office, London. The
letter of Carleton to Germain, Quebec, May 20, 1777, expressing his chagrin at not being appointed to lead the
expedition, but promising aid to Burgoyne, is printed in Brymner's <i>Report on the Canadian Archives</i> (1885,
p. cxxxii.) with Germain's answer. Howe in New York had notified Carleton at Quebec, April 5, that he
should not be able to communicate with Burgoyne. Walpole records in his <i>Last Journals</i> (ii. 160), "Lord
George Germain owned that General Howe had defeated all his views by going to Maryland instead of
waiting to join Burgoyne." There may have been a purpose to help create the impression of Burgoyne's
destination, which that officer tried to spread, in professing to aim at Connecticut, when Howe in April sent
an expedition, under Tryon, to Danbury, in Connecticut, to destroy stores. This was accomplished, but
Wooster and Arnold pressed the returning party with vigor and inflicted a considerable loss. Wooster was
killed. Congress ordered a monument to his memory (<i>Journals</i>, ii. 168. Cf. Deming's oration at the dedication
of a monument in 1854, and Hinman's <i>Connecticut during the Rev.</i>, 155). The contemporary accounts
are Howe's despatch to Germain, and the narrative in the <i>Connecticut Journal</i>, April 30 (both given in
Dawson's <i>Battles</i>, i. 217, 219); current reports in Moore's <i>Diary</i>, 423, 441; Trumbull's and Sullivan's letters
in <i>N. Hampshire State Papers</i>, viii. 547, 549, 556; a letter of James Wadsworth, dated at Durham, May 1,
1777, in <i>Trumbull MSS.</i>, vi. 94; with accounts in Jones's <i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i>, i. 178, and Stedman's
<i>Amer. War</i>, ch. 14. Marshall's account in his <i>Washington</i> was controverted by E. D. Whittlesey (<i>N. Y.
Hist. Coll.</i>, 2d ser., ii. 227). Cf. Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, iv. 404; Leake's <i>Lamb</i>, ch. xi., with a map; Stuart's

There is a contemporary broadside of it in the Mass. Hist. Soc. library, and it was printed for the English
public in the <i>Gentleman's Mag.</i> in August. Walpole, in London, in August, records his opinion of it,
"penned with such threats as would expose him to derision if he failed, and would diminish the lustre of his
success if he obtained any" (<i>Last Journals</i>, ii. 130). The dates given to it vary from June 29th to July 4th.
It will also be found in Anburey's <i>Travels</i>; Thacher's <i>Military Journal</i>; Moore's <i>Diary</i> (p. 454), from the
<i>Penna. Evening Post</i>, Aug. 21; Fonblanque's <i>Burgoyne</i> (App. F); Riedesel's <i>Memoirs</i>; <i>Hadden's Journal</i>
(p. 59); <i>Proceedings</i> of the Mass. Hist. Soc. (xii. 189) and N. Y. Hist. Soc. (Jan., 1872); <i>Vermont Hist.
Soc. Collections</i> (i. 163); <i>Niles's Register</i> (1876 ed., p. 179); <i>N. Hampshire State Papers</i>, viii. 660. It instigated
various burlesques (Moore's <i>Diary</i>, 459; his <i>Songs and Ballads of the Rev.</i>, 167).</p>

A map by Montresor, made in 1775, showing the antecedent knowledge of the country, is given in the
<i>American Atlas</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>A topographical Map of Hudson's River, ... also the Communication with Canada by Lake George and
Lake Champlain, as high as Fort Chambly, by Claude Joseph Sauthier. Engraved by Wm. Faden, published

<p class="pfc4"><i>A map of the inhabited parts of Canada, from the French surveys, with the frontiers of New York and
New England, from the large survey by Claude Joseph Sauthier, engraved by Wm. Faden</i> (London), 1777.
It is dedicated to Burgoyne, and in the margin is a table showing the various winter-quarters of the king's army
in Canada in 1776. In 1777, Le Rouge, in Paris, reproduced Sauthier's drafts as <i>Cours de la rivière d'Hudson
et la Communication avec le Canada par le lac Champlain jusqu'au Fort Chambly</i>. (Cf. the map in the
<i>Atlas Amériquain</i>, no. 23.) Sauthier's surveys were also used in a map of New York and adjacent provinces,
published at Augsburg in 1777, which is reproduced in Jones's <i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i> (vol. i.). The <i>Gentleman's
Mag.</i>, Jan., 1778, had a map of the Hudson River and the adjacent country. The <i>London Mag.</i>,
1778, had a map showing the country between Albany and Ticonderoga. It was drawn by Thomas Kitchin,
who in the same year made a map of the Hudson and adjacent parts from Albany to New York.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In 1780 (Feb. 1st) Faden published a more detailed map as drawn by Mr. Medcalfe, and called <i>A map of
the Country in which the army under Lieutenant-General Burgoyne acted in the Campaign of 1777, shewing
the marches of the army and the places of the principal actions</i>. (Cf. map in Stedman, reproduced in
illus. ed. of Irving's <i>Washington</i>, iii. 93.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">The maps as given in Burgoyne's <i>State of the Expedition from Canada</i> (London, 1780) are those usually
followed. The original MS. drafts of these, used for engraving them, are among the Faden maps (nos. 66-69)
in the library of Congress. A general map of the campaign is given in Hilliard d'Auberteuil's <i>Essais</i> (i.
205).</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is in <i>Hadden's Journal</i> (p. 90) a drawn map of the campaign between Crown Point and Stillwater,
showing the marches of the British army and the points of conflict. Among the Faden maps (nos. 62, 63) in
the library of Congress is a MS. map of "Lake Champlain and Lake George, and the country between the
Hudson and the lakes on the west and the Connecticut on the east." There are later and eclectic maps given
in Gordon's <i>American Revolution</i>; Anburey's <i>Travels</i>; Neilson's <i>Burgoyne's Campaign</i>, used and corrected
by Stone in his <i>Campaign of Burgoyne</i>; Carrington's <i>Battles</i> (312); Burgoyne's <i>Orderly-Book</i>; <i>Mag.

<i>The life and Public services of Arthur St. Clair, with his correspondence and other papers arranged
and annotated by Wm. Henry Smith.</i> The correspondence begins in 1771. H. P. Johnston thinks Smith
too sweeping and injudicial in his editing (<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Aug., 1882). St. Clair took command at
Ticonderoga June 12th. Smith includes in his book the proceedings of the councils of war (pp. 404, 420), and
the various letters of St. Clair, respecting his retreat, to Bowdoin (also in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, vi. 356),
Hancock, Jay, Washington, and others (pp. 396, 414, 423, 425, 426, 429, 433). Cf. Dawson's <i>Battles</i>. St.

The original of this, a carefully drawn MS. map of "the position of Col. Baum, 16th Aug., 1776, with the

The accounts of the day, as Marshall says, give him the command, and in his <i>Life of Washington</i>, first
edition, that writer so states it. Wilkinson, who was with Gates two miles from the fight, said in his <i>Memoirs</i>
that there was no general officer on the field; and this led Marshall in his second edition to leave the
question open. A letter of R. R. Livingston, Jan. 14, 1778, to Washington (<i>Correspondence of the Revolution</i>,
ii. 551) is capable of counter conclusions on this point; and Mr. Bancroft (orig. ed., ix. 410) who holds that Arnold
was not engaged during the day, judges that a letter of Colonel Richard Varick to General Schuyler,
written on the day of battle, supports that view. Bancroft's opinion is maintained by J. A. Stevens in his
paper "Benedict Arnold and his apologists", in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i> (March, 1880). That the victory
was won largely by Arnold's personal exertions is the opinion of nearly every other writer, and they find in the
letters of Livingston and Varick as much to sustain their view as Bancroft does to support his. Wilkinson writes
to St. Clair: "Gen. Arnold was not out of camp during the whole action" (<i>St. Clair Papers</i>, i. 89, 443). The
evidences in rebuttal of Wilkinson, who is the only positive witness on the negative side, are numerous, and have
been best arrayed by Isaac N. Arnold in his <i>Life of Arnold</i> (p. 175), and in the paper "Benedict Arnold at
Saratoga" (<i>United Service Mag.</i>, Sept., 1880; also printed separately), in which he added much new testimony,
gathered after he had published his <i>Life of Arnold</i>. This consists of the statements in <i>The Revolutionary
Services of General Wm. Hull</i> (N. Y., 1848); in a MS. account by Ebenezer Wakefield, who was in
Dearborn's light infantry, and written after Wilkinson, whom he controverts, had published his <i>Memoirs</i>; in
the narratives of the Germans Von Eelking and Riedesel. Moore (<i>Diary of the Revolution</i>, p. 498) cites a
letter of Enoch Poor, which seems to allow Arnold's share in the battle. Later still the diary of a chaplain
of the army has been published, <i>Chaplain Smith and the Baptists</i>, and this says distinctly (p. 209) that Arnold
commanded. Mr. R. A. Guild, the editor of that book, collates the evidence on this point. Washington
Irving, Lossing, Sydney H. Gay, William L. Stone,&mdash;not to name others,&mdash;have contended for Arnold's participancy
in the day's doings. Lecky (iv. 67) expresses himself satisfied with the proofs adduced by I. N.
Arnold. Cf. Rogers in <i>Hadden's Journal</i>, p. 27.</p>

reported by Gen. W. H. Sumner in <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i> (Feb., 1858, ii. 273), gave some reminiscences of
Arnold's conduct. The surgeon attending Arnold said "his peevishness would degrade the most capricious
of the fair sex" (<i>N. E. Hist. and Geneal. Reg.</i>, 1864, p. 34).</p>

the battle-ground of Oct. 7 to enable one to identify the points of the conflict. Gen. Hoyt's description of

Also <i>N. Y. Hist. Coll.</i>, 1879. Cf. Geo. W. Schuyler's <i>Colonial New York</i>, ii. 267; <i>Amer. Hist. Record</i>, ii.
145. The jealousy, or rather dislike, of Schuyler on the part of New England men was the natural result of
the contact of commander and subordinates so strongly opposed as an aristocratic Knickerbocker and the self-willed
democrats of the Eastern States. Cf., on this antagonism, <i>John Adams's Works</i>, iii. 87; Graydon's
<i>Memoirs</i>, passim; Gordon, ii. 331; Irving's <i>Washington</i>, iii. 128, etc. A survival of the feelings had doubtless
colored some of the later estimates of Schuyler's character, and the opposing views can be seen in Lossing's
<i>Schuyler</i> (ii. 325, etc.) and in Bancroft's <i>United States</i>. Cf. also Geo. L. Schuyler's <i>Correspondence
and Remarks upon Bancroft's History of the Northern Campaign of 1777 and the character of General
Schuyler</i>. The dissatisfaction with Schuyler was not, however, confined to New England. Reference seems
to be made to him as an "infamous villain" in the letters of Samuel Kennedy, a surgeon of Pennsylvania
troops (<i>Penna. Mag. of Hist.</i>, viii. 114, where he is presumably spoken of as "G. S ... r").</p>

The following orderly-books and journals of the campaign have been noted:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Orderly book of lieut. gen. John Burgoyne, from his entry into the state of New York until his surrender
at Saratoga, 16th Oct. 1777. From the original manuscript deposited at Washington's head quarters, Newburgh,
N. Y. Edited by E. B. O'Callaghan</i> (Albany, 1860), being no. 7 of <i>Munsell's Historical Series</i>. (Cf.
J. T. Headley in <i>The Galaxy</i>, xxii. 604.) Gen. Horatio Rogers is satisfied that this Newburgh MS. is not an
original record; and he has printed in his <i>Hadden's Journal</i> such records as are either defectively printed by
O'Callaghan or not printed at all. Burgoyne's orders to the inhabitants of Castleton are in the <i>N. H. State
Papers</i>, viii. 625, 658. There was published at Albany in 1882, as no. 12 of <i>Munsell's Historical Series</i>, a
book entitled <i>Hadden's journal and orderly books. A journal kept in Canada and upon Burgoyne's
campaign in 1776 and 1777, by Lieutenant James Murray Madden. Also orders kept by him and issued
by Sir Guy Carleton, Lieut. General Burgoyne and Major General William Phillips, in 1776, 1777, and
1778. With an explanatory chapter and notes by Horatio Rogers</i>. Respecting this publication, Mr. William
L. Stone says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">"The journal of Lieutenant Hadden is, perhaps, one of the most important manuscript documents bearing
upon Burgoyne's campaign that has yet been discovered. This journal formerly belonged to William Cobbett
of London. The elaborate maps with which the writer has interspersed his journal fully indicate the importance
of the strategical positions taken by Schuyler previous to Gates assuming the command. Besides the
journal there are several orderly-books, in which the proceedings of the British army from day to day are
minutely set forth. In the manuscript book at Washington's headquarters at Newburgh, the order of the day
for 19th of August, 1777, is missing. This missing link, however, is supplied by Hadden, who gives it in full,
and it proves to have been an order issued by Major-General Phillips, in the absence, that day, of General
Burgoyne, as follows: 'Major-General Phillips,' reads the missing order for the 19th, 'has heard with the
utmost astonishment, that, notwithstanding his most serious and positive orders of the 16th instant, that no
carts should be used for any purpose whatever but the transport of provisions, unless by particular orders from
the commander-in-chief as expressed in the order, there are this day above thirty carts on the road laden with
baggage <i>said to be their Lieutenant-General's</i>.'"</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Hadden journals and orderly-books were bought in 1875 by General Rogers, having passed through
Henry Stevens's hands, and are carefully printed, with fac-similes of the MS. maps accompanying them.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Supplementing these, the following orderly-books may be mentioned:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Henry B. Livingston's.&mdash;Troops under Gen. Schuyler, St. Clair, &amp;c. Ticonderoga, Stillwater, &amp;c.,
June 13 to August 19, 1777.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Gen. Philip Schuyler's.&mdash;Fort Edward, Albany, June 29 to August 18, 1777.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Camp at Stillwater, Saratoga and Albany, &amp;c. August 12 to November 4, 1774.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Col. Thaddeus Cook's, of Wallingford, Conn., Stillwater, September 6 to October 6, 1777. Weekly Returns
of the Regiment, September 13, 27, and October 21, 1777.</i></p>
<p class="pfc4"><i>Capt. William Gates's Company, of Col. Timo. Bigelow's Regiment, Weekly Returns, various dates from
October, 1777, to September, 1778.</i> Also in same covers, <i>Orderly Book of Lieut. David Grout's Company, of
Timothy Bigelow's Regiment, February 15, 1779, to June 15, 1779, and Weekly Returns of Capt. Peirce's
Co., same Regiment, in 1780</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">These are all in the library of the Amer. Antiq. Soc. at Worcester, Mass. An orderly-book of James Kimball,
of Croft's regiment, June, 1777, to Dec., 1778, has been published by the Essex Institute (Salem, Mass.).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The following diaries may be named:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">The journal of Henry Dearborn, Aug. 3-Dec. 3, which was in the J. W. Thornton sale, 1878, no. 501. It
is now in the Boston Public Library, and is included in Dearborn's journals as printed in the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i>, 1886, edited by Mellen Chamberlain, and separately as <i>Journals of Henry Dearborn</i>, 1776-1783 (Cambridge,
1887).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Chaplain Smith's diary, July and Aug., 1777, in R. A. Guild's <i>Chaplain Smith and the Baptists</i>, p. 197;
Ralph Cross's journal, beginning Aug. 29, 1777, at Newburyport, and ending there on his return, Dec. 5th, in
the <i>Hist. Mag.</i> (vol. xvii. pp. 8-11); diary of Ephraim Squier, Sept. 4 to Nov. 2, 1777, preserved in the Pension
Office, Washington. Extracts from the diary of Capt. Benj. Warren are preserved in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (no.
xlvii.). A copy of the journal of Samuel Harris, Jr., of Boston, during the campaign of 1777, after he joined
the army at Stillwater, Sept. 20th, and describing the fight of Bemis's Heights, Oct. 7th, and the surrender of
Oct. 17th, is in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (xxv.). Cf. McAlpine's <i>Memoirs</i>, published in 1788.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The British journals of Burgoyne's campaign by actors in it, which have been printed, are Roger Lamb's
<i>Original and authentic journal of occurrences during the late American war</i> (Dublin, 1809), and his
<i>Memoir of his own Life</i> (Dublin, 1811),&mdash;he was sergeant of the Royal Welsh Fusileers,&mdash;and Thomas
Anburey's <i>Travels through the interior parts of America</i> (London, 1789 and 1791; French versions, Paris,
1790 and 1793; German, Berlin, 1792). Anburey was attached as a volunteer to the grenadier company of the
29th foot. (Cf. Rogers's <i>Hadden Journals</i>, explanatory chapter.) There is an English diary in the <i>Mag.
of Amer. Hist.</i> (Feb., 1878).</p>
<p class="pfc4">For other personal records of the campaign, reference may be made to the brief summary of Maj. Hughes,
one of Gates's aides (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Feb., 1858, iii. 279); the autobiography of Col. Philip van Cortlandt,
of the second New York regiment (<i>N. Y. Geneal. and Biog. Rec.</i>, July, 1874, vol. v. 123, and <i>Hist.
Mag.</i>, 1878).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Similar records on the British side are Maj. Edward M'Gauran's <i>Memoirs</i>, privately printed in London in
1786, in two volumes, and <i>The narrative of Captain Samuel Mackay, commandant of a provincial regiment
in North America; by the appointment of Lieut.-Gen. Burgoyne</i> (Kingston, 1778). The author gives
an account of his services as a royalist in command of a company of provincials attached to General Burgoyne's
army, and complains of the refusal of the British generals to recognize him as an officer.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The British Museum has recently acquired a contemporary military critique of the campaign, by one of
the actors in it, Lieut. Digby, of the British army.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The diary of the Hanau artillerist, Pausch, is preserved at Cassel, and a copy is in the hands of Mr.
Edw. J. Lowell, from which a second copy was made, and from this no. 14 of <i>Munsell's Hist. Series</i> was
printed as <i>Journal of Capt. Pausch, chief of the Hanau artillery during the Burgoyne campaign. Translated
and annotated by W. L. Stone. Introduction by E. J. Lowell</i> (Albany, 1886). Pausch covers the interval
from the day he left Hanau, May 15, 1776, to the close of Burgoyne's last battle, Oct. 7, 1777. There is
in the notes (p. 149) a letter of one John Clunes, which shows some of the perils of the attempt to keep Burgoyne's
rear open at Ticonderoga. A journal of Johann Konrad Döhla, a private of the regiment of Anspach,
1777-1783, is in the <i>Deutsch-Amerikanisches Mag.</i>, 1886-1887.</p>

Mr. Stone adds a note (p. 149) on the periodical contributions of Gen. J. Watts De Peyster to the history
and criticism of the campaign, aimed in large part to vindicate Schuyler and portray the patriotism of New
York State. Cf. his paper in the <i>United Service</i>, ix. 365. A paper on the campaign in the <i>Mag. of
Amer. History</i>, Dec., 1881, p. 457, refers to an article on the same topic in <i>Graham's Magazine</i> (Apr., 1847),
by N. C. Brooks, mentioning original documents. A. B. Street printed a paper on Saratoga in the <i>Hist. Mag.</i>,
March, 1858. Cf. Lemoine's <i>Maple Leaves</i>, second series (Quebec, p. 123).</p>

In Burgoyne's <i>State of the Expedition</i> is a "Plan of the encampment and position of the army under
Gen. Burgoyne at Sword's House, on Hudson River, near Stillwater, on Sept. 17th, with the positions of that
part of the army engaged on the 19th Sept., 1777. Drawn by W. C. Wilkinson, Lt. 62d Reg. Engraved by
Wm. Faden", and published in London, Feb. 1, 1780. It has a portion superposed, showing later positions.
There is a composite map in Carrington's <i>Battles</i> (p. 344); and in <i>Hadden's Journal</i> (p. 164) fac-simile of
drawn plans of the order of march and order of battle on Sept. 19. There is a map of the battle of the 19th
in <i>Pausch's Journal</i>, p. 163. Loosing (i. 53) gives a view of the Stillwater ground.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Burgoyne's <i>State of the Expedition</i> also contains a "Plan of the encampment and position of the army
under Gen. Burgoyne at Bræmus Heights, on the 20th Sept., with the position of the detachments in the
action of the 7th Oct., and the position of the army on the 8th Oct. Drawn by W. C. Wilkinson. Engraved
by Wm. Faden", and published Feb. 1, 1780. This is reproduced in Fonblanque's <i>Burgoyne</i> (p. 292). Carrington
(p. 350) gives an excellent eclectic map.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A plan of the battles of Freeman's Farm and Bemis's Heights, made by Col. Rufus Putnam, is preserved
at Marietta, Ohio, and a copy is in Col. Stone's collection at Jersey City. There is also a plan given in Charles
Wilson's <i>Account of Burgoyne's Campaign</i> (Albany, 1844), which is revised in Stone's <i>Campaign of Burgoyne</i>.
Stedman's plan (<i>American War</i>, i. 352) traces the movements from Sept. 10th to the capitulation.
Cf. Grant's <i>British Battles</i>, ii. 150.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The positions from Oct. 10th, when the investment of Burgoyne's camp began, to the 16th, when the surrender
took place, are shown on the American side in a map sketched by Chapman from an original of an officer,
which appeared in the <i>Analectic Mag.</i> (Philad., 1818, p. 433), and is reproduced herewith.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In Burgoyne's <i>State of the Expedition</i> is Faden's "Plan of the position which the army under Lt.-Gen. Burgoyne
took at Saratoga on the 10th of Oct., 1777, and in which it remained till the convention was signed." It
is reproduced in Fonblanque's <i>Burgoyne</i> (p. 302). Carrington (p. 354) gives a careful plan, and there are
others in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i> (vol. i. 273) and Lowell's <i>Hessians</i> (p. 163), taken from Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>
(i. 77). Lossing also gives a view (p. 80) of the field of surrender, the signatures to the convention (p. 79),
the medal given to Gates (p. 83), the house used by Gates as headquarters (p. 75), and the house occupied by
the Baroness Riedesel (pp. i. 89, 557; cf. also Stone's <i>Campaign of Burgoyne</i>, p. 94).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Upon the landmarks and topography of this series of movements, see papers in the <i>Boston Monthly</i> (i. 505)
for a visit to Bemis's Heights; a paper by W. L. Stone in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i> (Nov., 1885, p. 510) on the
remains of the works as now seen; and an examination of the localities in G. W. Schuyler's <i>Colonial New
York</i> (ii. 128). Cf. Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i> and his <i>Book of the Hudson</i>.</p>

Cf. Bancroft's character of Burgoyne, in his orig. ed., vii. 245. Fonblanque (p. 5) charges Bancroft
with coarseness in speaking of alleged but unfounded statements of Burgoyne's shame of birth. A certain
swagger about the man laid Burgoyne open to the stinging burlesques of the small writers of the day. Cf.
<i>The Lamentations of Gen. Burgoyne</i> (Sabin, iii. 9,262); <i>Calendrier de Philadelphie</i>, 1779 (<i>Ibid.</i> xiv. 61, 511),

There were six editions printed in London, and one in Dublin, in 1778 (Sabin, iii. no. 9,257; Menzies, no.
264). These speeches were in response to a motion of inquiry made by John Wilkes, whose copy of this pamphlet
belongs now to Mr. Charles Deane; and, by Wilkes's annotations upon it, it seems that Wilkes recalled
a good deal that Burgoyne said and did not print, and qualified other parts which he did print.</p>

"Those", wrote Washington, in a letter
intended only for the eye of his step-son, "who
want faith to believe the accounts of the shocking
wastes of Howe's army&mdash;of their ravaging,
plundering, and the abuse of women&mdash;may be
convinced to their sorrow ... if a check cannot
be put to their progress."</p>

Lee was wrought upon by Joseph Reed writing to him, Nov. 21st, of Washington's "indecisive mind"
(C. Lee's <i>Memoirs</i>; Moore's <i>Treason of Lee</i>, p. 46), and the next day Lee wrote in the same spirit to Bowdoin
(<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 49), and on the 24th he wrote to Reed of Washington's "fatal indecision." Moore examines
this hesitancy of Lee (pp. 48, 57). For suspicions as to Lee's conduct at this time, see Moore's <i>Treason of
Lee</i>; Heath's <i>Memoirs</i>, 88; Reed's <i>Jos. Reed</i>, i. 253; Drake's <i>Knox</i>; J. C. Hamilton's <i>Republic</i>, i. ch. 6;

<p class="pfc4">Lee's exchange was rendered possible when Washington acquired a prisoner of equal rank by the exploit of
Colonel Barton. This Rhode Island officer summoned a party, and in whale-boats crossed Narragansett Bay,
and (July 10, 1777) surprised Gen. Richard Prescott in bed at his headquarters, a few miles north of Newport
where he held command of the British who,
under Clinton and Percy, had taken possession
of that port in Dec., 1776 (Almon'S <i>Remembrancer</i>,
iii. 261; Jones's <i>N. Y. during
the Rev.</i>, i. 639). The parole of Gen. Prescott,
July 14, 1777, given at Providence, as
well as a letter from Lambert Cadwalader,
"being greatly indebted to his politeness and
generosity while a prisoner in New York", are
in the <i>Trumbull MSS.</i> (vol. vi.). The parole is printed in Arnold's <i>Rhode Island</i>, ii. 403. General Smith's
letter, July 12th, to Howe is in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>, lviii. Contemporary accounts are in Moore's <i>Diary</i>, i. 468.
Cf. Force's <i>Archives</i>, 4th ser., vol. iv., and Thacher's <i>Mil. Journal</i>. Barton was assisted by a negro. <i>Livermore's

which was printed as no. 1 of the <i>R. I. Hist. Tracts</i>. Cf. <i>Narrative of the surprise and Capture of
Maj.-Gen. Richard Prescott, July 9, 1777</i> (Windsor, Vt., 1821), and a tract of similar title, Philadelphia,

The principal controversial tracts upon the charges of incompetency preferred against Howe are these:
The <i>Narrative of Lieut.-Gen. Howe relative to his Conduct during his late command in North America</i>
(London, 1780, several eds.). <i>Letters to a nobleman on the Conduct of the War in the middle Colonies</i>,
(London, 1780, various eds.). Howe replied in <i>Observations</i>; and this led to a <i>Reply to the Observations</i>
(London, 1781). Another severe critic appeared in <i>Two letters from Agricolas to Sir William Howe</i> (London,
1779). Galloway was sharp in his <i>Examination</i>. The loyalists felt Howe's shortcomings poignantly, as they
prolonged, as was thought, their exile (<i>Life of Peter Van Shaack</i>, 167). The contemporary historians, like
Murray and Gordon, did not spare him. The later ones, like Andrews (ii. ch. 26), Adolphus (ii. ch. 31), Smyth
(<i>Lectures</i>, no. 34), were quite as severe. The American historians have not disputed the adverse conclusion
(Marshall, Bancroft, Irving, etc.). Cf. Sargent's <i>André</i>, ch. 7, and a note in his <i>Stansbury and Odell</i>, 137.
The current story that the charms of Mrs. Loring paralyzed the English general finds occasional record (John
Bernard's <i>Recoll. of America</i>, N. Y., 1887, p. 60). On General Howe's lineage, as affecting his characteristics,
see <i>General Sir William Howe's Orderly-Book, 1775-1776</i>, etc., <i>collected by B. F. Stevens, with hist. introd.
by Edw. E. Hale</i> (London, 1884); also Dawson's <i>Westchester</i>, p. 217.</p>

Hutchinson, in London, seems to have thought Boston the object of the campaign (<i>Mem. Hist. Boston</i>,
iii. 165; Adams's <i>Familiar Letters</i>, 286; Hutchinson's <i>Diaries</i>, ii. 152). James Lovell writes from Philadelphia,
July 29, 1777, that Howe seems bound up the Delaware; but he warns his friends in New England that
his present movements may be undertaken to cloak an ultimate design upon the New England coast (<i>Charles
Lowell MSS.</i>).</p>

<i>Washington</i>, vol. v. App. p. 456. Some confusion has arisen from the fact that the ford called Buffenton's
at a later day was not the one so known at the time of the battle, and there are in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i> (lii.
vol. iii.) some letters upon this point from William B. Reed (with a small pen-map) and Alfred Elwyn.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There has been some question upon the responsibility of Sullivan for the defeat; but Washington asked to
be allowed to suspend the execution of the orders of Congress, withdrawing Sullivan from the army. Bancroft
(ix. 395) has been the chief accuser of late, and T. C. Amory, in his <i>Mil. Services of Gen. Sullivan</i> (pp. 45,
50), the principal defender. Sullivan's letter to Congress, Sept. 27th, which Bancroft (ix. 397) considers
"essential to a correct understanding of the battle", is in <i>N. H. Hist. Coll.</i>, ii. 208; Dawson, i. 279; <i>Mass.
Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, Dec., 1866, p. 407; his letter of vindication, Nov. 5th, is in <i>N. H. State Papers</i>, viii. 743.
A copy of Sullivan's defence (Nov. 9, 1777) is among the Langdon Papers, and is copied in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>
(lii. vol. ii. p. 199). The counter-arguments of the case are examined in the <i>Penna. Hist. Soc. Bulletin</i>, vol. i.
Read's <i>George Read</i>, 273, questions Sullivan's vigilance. Cf. Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, v. 108, 456, for the
charges against Sullivan. Bancroft also criticises the conduct of Greene, and Geo. W. Greene (<i>Life of Greene</i>,
i. 447, 453; ii. 460) defends that general.</p>

iii. 565. The widow of a wounded guide, Francis Jacobs, applied for a pension as late as 1858 (<i>Senate Repts.,
no. 213, 35th Cong., 1st sess.</i>). Washington's headquarters are shown in Smith's <i>Del. County</i>, p. 304, and
<i>Penna. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, i.; and Lafayette's in <i>Smith</i>, 310. A view of the field is given in Day's <i>Hist. Coll.

<p class="pfc4">Accounts more or less general are in Gordon, Irving (iii. ch. 18), Lossing, Gay (iii. 543), Thaddeus Allen's
<i>Origination of the Amer. Union</i>; Hollister's <i>Conn.</i>, ii. ch. 16; <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, ii. 310. Washington seems
to have been poorly informed about the country, and to have relied on false intelligence.</p>

vessels is described by Wallace (p. 247), referring in connection to the <i>Universal Mag.</i>, vol. lxii. Cf.

The question of Mrs. Arnold's privity to her husband's plot has been much discussed, but most investigators
acquit her. Her innocence is maintained by Irving (<i>Washington</i>, iv. 151), Isaac N. Arnold (<i>Arnold</i>
ch. 17), Sargent (<i>André</i>, p. 220), and Sabine (<i>Loyalists</i>, i. 122). The chief accusations are in Leake's <i>General
Lamb</i>, 270, and in the Lives of Aaron Burr by Davis (i. 219) and Parton (p. 126). Cf. Mrs. Ellet's <i>Women
of the Rev.</i>, ii. 213; Stone's <i>Brant</i>, ii. 101; Reed's <i>Joseph Reed</i>, ii. 373. The scene in which she showed disorder
of mind, when she accused Washington of attempting to kill her child, is held by some to have been
mere acting. (Cf. Jones, <i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i>, i. 745.) It seems clear that she did not wish to join her
husband when the authorities of Pennsylvania drove her to New York.</p>

The writing in which Washington conveyed this reprimand is about the most adroit piece of literary composition
which we have from his pen, and he contrived, while complying with the sentence of the court, to signify
his estimate of the venial character of the offences, and to pronounce what some have considered a practical
eulogy on a brilliant soldier. (Isaac N. Arnold's <i>Arnold</i>, Irving's <i>Washington</i>.) The former book gives
a full examination of Arnold's career during his command in Philadelphia (chapters 12-14). For the trial,
see Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, vi. 231, 248, 261, and App. p. 514. The trial closed Jan. 26, 1780. Congress
ordered the report of the trial to be printed: <i>Proceedings of a general Court-Martial for the trial of
Benedict Arnold</i>. Philadelphia, 1780. It was reprinted in a few copies for presentation, with introduction,
notes, and index, by F. S. Hoffman, in New York in 1865. A letter of Arnold, transmitting the report to
President Weare of New Hampshire, dated March 20, 1780, is in MS. <i>Miscell. Papers</i>, 1777-1824, vol. i. p.
156 (Mass. Hist. Soc. library).</p>

It is believed that the writer of this letter was Beverley Robinson, a loyalist in the British service. The
letter is only known through the French version in Marbois' <i>Complot</i>, and it has not passed without some suspicion
of its genuineness. (Cf. Arnold's <i>Arnold</i>, p. 275; Sargent's <i>André</i>, 446; <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Sept.,
1878, p. 756; Reed's <i>Jos. Reed</i>, ii. 54, etc.)</p>

Johnson says (<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, viii. 731) that Varick's papers show that Arnold's letter to Anderson
of Aug. 30th never reached André, though Sparks and Sargent print it as having been received. This is the
letter which Sargent supposes may have been conveyed to André by Heron. This and Arnold's of Sept. 15th
are the only ones of "Gustavus" preserved. Fac-similes of a part of one of these letters, with a portion of
one of "Anderson's", are given in Sparks's <i>Arnold</i>; in Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 146; in the <i>Cyclop. of U. S.
Hist.</i>, ii. 1410, etc. Cf. <i>Harper's Monthly</i>, lii. 825. Fac-similes of Arnold's passes are in Lossing, ii. 155.
These passes are printed in Dawson's <i>Papers</i>, 60; H. W. Smith's <i>Andreana</i>; McCoy's edition of the <i>Proceedings</i>,
etc., and in other places.</p>

Percy Greg, in his <i>History of the United States</i> (London, 1887), vol. i. p. 304, thinks Joshua Smith was
in the pay of Washington, and persuaded André to put on a disguise in order that he might be condemned
as a spy if caught! This opinion is of the character of most of the speculations in the book; of course it
condemns the execution.</p>

These papers, having been used in André's trial, were passed over to Governor Clinton to be used in the
civil trial of Smith, and from Clinton's descendant Sparks procured them when he was writing his <i>Life and
Treason of Arnold</i>. Lossing also got them from the same source, and collated them with Sparks's copies
before he printed them in his <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 153. They were subsequently bought by the State of New York,
and are now in the State library at Albany. They have since been printed by McCoy in his edition of the
<i>Proceedings</i> of André's examination; by Boynton in his <i>West Point</i>, ch. 7; by Dawson in his <i>Papers</i> ("Gazette
series"), 51; in the Appendix of his edition of Smith's trial, and in <i>Revolutionary Relics or Clinton

Some memoranda of his aide, Colonel Varick (<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, viii. 727) show that Arnold's movements
were hastened by the arrival of Washington's servant at this moment, announcing the near approach of
his master.</p>

They were subsequently released in New York. Dr. William Eustis's account of this flight to the "Vulture",
written May 8, 1815, is in the Mass. Hist. Soc. cabinet (<i>Letters and Papers</i>, 1777-1824, vol. ii. 206),
and is printed in their <i>Collections</i>, xiv. 52. Its purport is to emphasize the patriotic resistance of the boatmen
to Arnold's offers for their desertion. He says some of them were sent ashore in an inferior boat,
Arnold keeping the barge. Cf. Heath's <i>Memoirs</i>.</p>

The Varick memoranda (<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, viii.) would seem to indicate that Varick, Franks, and Dr.
Eustis had already begun to be suspicious, and Arnold's barge had been observed by some one to go down
stream and not to West Point.</p>

Arnold had, before leaving, cautioned this messenger to keep quiet, and this also becoming known increased
the suspicion of his aides (<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, viii.).</p>

These aides were Colonel Richard Varick and Major David S. Franks. Henry P. Johnston, in a paper,
"Colonel Varick and Arnold's Treason", printed in the <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Nov., 1882 (viii. p. 717), has
thrown some new light, from papers of Colonel Varick, on the life at Robinson's house previous to the flight
of Arnold, and on the evidence, both of Varick, Franks, and Dr. Eustis, brought out before a board of inquiry,
Nov. 2, which acquitted these officers of any complicity in the plot. On the night when Smith had been
dragged from his bed and put in confinement, Arnold's aides had been put under arrest. This paper also
shows, from a deposition of General Knox, that Varick had found in one of Arnold's trunks, after his desertion,
some plans and profiles of the West Point works.</p>

These orders are in Dawson's <i>Papers</i>, p. 63. Colonel Lamb had command of the immediate works at
West Point at the time; but being absent, Col. Nathaniel Wade had temporary charge (<i>Ipswich Antiq.

It is only within a few years, and since the publication of Clinton's record of the secret service of headquarters,
that it has been known that Gen. S. H. Parsons, of Connecticut, was at this time acting as a spy for

One of these is preserved in the Trumbull gallery at New Haven. It represents André himself sitting in

boat from the "Vulture", showing André rowed ashore. An aquatint engraving from it was published in New
York in 1780, of which there is a reproduction in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, lii. p. 835, and Lossing's <i>Two Spies</i>. Cf.

knighthood made to his brother, "in order to wipe away all stain from the family."</p>

The amount received was £6,315 (Sargent's <i>André</i>, 450). He issued an address of exculpation to the
inhabitants of America, dated New York, Oct. 7, 1780, which is printed by Isaac N. Arnold (p. 330) from the
original MS. in a text varying slightly from other printed copies, as in the <i>Political Mag.</i>, i. 734. A fortnight
later (Oct. 20th) he issued a proclamation to induce defection among the officers and soldiers of the army, the
original draft of which is among the Force Papers in the library of Congress. It is printed in I. N. Arnold,
p. 332; in <i>Polit. Mag.</i>, i. 766, etc.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Sargent thinks that a vindication of Arnold which appeared in <i>Remarks on the Travels of M. de Chastellux</i>,

The original records of this trial are said to have disappeared from the State archives at Albany, but
they had been printed in the <i>New York Herald</i>. Dawson reprinted this Herald text in the <i>Historical Mag.</i>,

complicity in the treason of Benedict Arnold, 1780, Ed. by H. B. Dawson</i> (Morrisania, 1866). Sparks made
use of the record; and the evidence has been examined in P. W. Chandler's <i>American Criminal Trials</i>, ii.
155, 183. The <i>Gentleman's Mag.</i>, 1780, Supplement, p. 610, gave an account of the trial and printed the

André had been a prisoner at Lancaster, Pa., after his capture at St. John, Nov. 2, 1775, to Dec., 1776,
when he was exchanged. He was paroled in Feb., 1776 (<i>Penna. Mag. of Hist.</i>, i.). Afterwards he served

"intimate friends" in <i>Political Mag.</i>, i. 688; ii. 171. His lineage is traced by J. L. Chester in <i>Mass. Hist.

Isaac N. Arnold was of very remote kin to Benedict. He had access to the Shippen Papers, the papers
owned by Arnold's descendants in England and in Canada, and used the letters of Arnold, his wife and sister,
in the Department of State. His praise of Arnold's "patriotism" in the earlier years of the war, which he
thought was evinced by his brilliant acts in the field, induced a paper by J. A. Stevens on "Arnold and his
Apologist" (<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, March, 1880), who contended that there was "no evidence that the heart
of Arnold ever beat with one patriotic thrill." The biographer, while condemning the treason, makes the best
show which he can of the provocations which led Arnold to be false. He adds considerable that is new to
Arnold's story. Mr. I. N. Arnold died in 1884, and addresses upon him before the Chicago Hist. Society were
printed.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Lossing has written much on the subject of Arnold's treason: <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. ch. 6, 7, and 8; <i>Harper's
Monthly</i>, iii., xxiii., and liii.; <i>Two Spies</i> (Hale and André), N. Y., 1886. Cf., on these two spies, Hull's <i>Rev.
Services</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Other American treatments of the subject are in the lives of Washington by Marshall (iv. 274) and Irving
(iv. ch. 9-11); Greene's <i>Greene</i> (ii. 227); Leake's <i>Lamb</i>, ch. 19 and App. D; Reed's <i>Reed</i>, ii. 252 Hamilton's
<i>Hamilton</i>, i. 262; Quincy's <i>Shaw</i>, 77; Dunlap's <i>New York</i>, ii. ch. 13; E. G. Holland's "Highland
Treason", in his <i>Essays</i>; Winthrop Atwill's <i>Treason of Arnold</i>, Northampton, 1837; <i>Niles's Register</i>, xx.</p>

There remained for a long time no doubt as to the unalloyed patriotism of the three men who captured
André. Washington praised their resistance to bribes, and Congress gave them a medal (figured in Loubat's
<i>Medallic Hist. U. S.</i>, and in Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 205). Some of those who came in close contact with
André after his capture, and heard his account of the arrest, were convinced that André felt that if he could
have made any considerable sum certain to them they would have let him go. This belief, on their part, of
these keepers of André did not come to public notice till, in 1817, John Paulding, one of the captors, and the
leader of them, petitioned Congress for an additional pension. This gave occasion to Benj. Tallmadge, who
had been André's chief-keeper, and who was then in Congress, to oppose the bill on the grounds of André's
statements. The <i>Journals</i> of the House of Representatives show the debate, which is reprinted in Dawson's
<i>Papers</i>, 127. A letter of Gen. Joshua King, also in André's confidence at the time, confirms Tallmadge's
view, and there is also a similar statement by Bowman, one of André's guards (Sparks's <i>Arnold</i>; <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, ix.; <i>Niles's Register</i>; <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 204, 293; iii. 229; Dawson's <i>Papers</i>, 45; Jones's <i>N. Y. during
the Rev.</i>, i. 733; <i>Boston Sunday Herald</i>, Sept. 14, 1879).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The captors did not want for friends. Judge Egbert Benson published a <i>Vindication of the Captors of
Maj. André</i>, 1817 (cf. <i>Analectic Mag.</i>, x. 307), which was reprinted in N. Y. in 1865, in two editions, with
additional matter, one by Sabin, the other by Hoffman. John Paulding, the son of one of the captors, published
a paper in their defence (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 331). The three captors were then all living, and each made
statements and affidavits respecting the event. These can be found, whole or in part, in Benson; in the <i>Hist.
Mag.</i>, ix. 177, xviii. 365; in Dawson's <i>Papers</i>, 119, 123, 182; in H. J. Raymond's <i>Address</i> (N. Y., 1853) at
Tarrytown; in <i>Cent. Celebrations of N. Y.</i> (1879); in Sabin's <i>Amer. Bibliopolist</i>, 1869, p. 335; in Simms's
<i>Schoharie County</i>, 646. Sargent thinks that Paulding (of whom there is a portrait in H. W. Smith's <i>Andreana</i>)
was the one of the three that most firmly resisted André's bribes.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A monument was erected at Tarrytown in 1853, when Henry J. Raymond delivered an address; it was
remodelled in 1883, and capped with a statue of a captor, when Chauncey M. Depew spoke in defence of the
good names of the captors; and a <i>Centennial Souvenir</i> was prepared by Nathaniel C. Husted (N. Y., 1881).
Monuments have been erected at the graves of the three captors: for Paulding's and Van Wart's, see Lossing's
<i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 171, 192; for Williams's, erected at Old Fort Schoharie in 1876, when addresses were
given by Daniel Knower and Grenville Tremain, see <i>Centennial Celebrations of the State of N. Y.</i> (Albany,
1879). For memorials of Williams, see <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Feb., 1887, p. 168.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A letter of Maj. Henry Lee describing the capture is in the <i>Penna. Mag. of Hist.</i> (1880), iv. 61. Cf.
<i>Amer. Hist. Rec.</i>, Dec., 1873; <i>Potter's Amer. Monthly</i>, vii. 167; Bolton's <i>Westchester</i>, i. 213.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Respecting André in confinement, Major, later Colonel, Tallmadge has left several statements,&mdash;letters,
Sept. 23, 1780 (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, xlix. vol. iii.); to Heath, Oct. 10, 1780 (<i>Heath MSS.</i>, printed in Dawson, 194,
and in Sargent, 469); his letters to Sparks in 1833-4 (<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, 1879, pp. 748, 752); his <i>Memoir</i>,
privately printed by his son, F. A. T., and the extracts from it (<i>Hist. Magazine</i>, Aug., 1859; and Dawson's
<i>Papers</i>).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Washington gave his version of the conspiracy at a dinner-table in 1786, which is contained in Richard
Rush's <i>Washington in Domestic Life, being letters addressed to his secretary, Lear, 1790-97</i> (also in Dawson,
139). There are many references in the letters of 1780 in Sparks's <i>Washington</i> (vii, 205, 212-222, 235,
241, 256, 260-65, 281, 296, and in the App. pp. 520-552, most of the documentary proofs), and in his <i>Letters
to Washington</i> (iii. 101-111), much of which is given in Dawson.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Several letters of Hamilton, contained in his <i>Correspondence</i>, are of interest: one to Greene; one to Miss
Schuyler, usually dated Oct. 2, but Bancroft says it is without date and must have been written later, and, as
usually printed, has omissions and interpolations. Of particular value is a letter of Hamilton's to Henry Laurens,
in which he wished André's desire for a soldier's death could have been gratified (Lodge's ed. <i>Works</i>,
viii.; Dawson; H. W. Smith's <i>Andreana</i>; McCoy's ed. <i>Proceedings</i>. Cf. <i>Pennsylvania Packet</i>, in Moore's
Diary, ii. 333).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Lafayette's account is in his <i>Memoirs</i>, Eng. trans., N. Y., i. 253-56, 349, as well as letters to Luzerne and
others (Dawson, 204, etc.). Sparks held various conferences with Lafayette in later life, and his notes are in
the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>, xxxii. J. F. Cooper, in his <i>Notions of the Americans picked up by a travelling Bachelor</i>,
has an account which he says he derived from Lafayette in later years and from a British officer who had heard
Arnold tell his story at a dinner.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In Dawson's <i>Papers</i> are included various other contemporary accounts: letters of Alex. Scammell (Oct. 1st,
in Mass. Hist. Soc. cabinet; <i>Misc. Papers</i>, 1777-1824, i. 192; Oct. 3d, in <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, xviii. 145; and Farmer
and Moore's <i>Hist. Coll. N. H.</i>); of Anthony Wayne, Sept. 27 and Oct. 1, 1780 (<i>Amer. Bibliopolist</i>, 1870,
p. 62); extracts from the <i>Bland Papers</i>, ii. 33-38; and Maj. Samuel Shaw to the Rev. Mr. Eliot, in Shaw's
<i>Journals</i>, 77-82.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Some papers of Timothy Pickering, formerly possessed by the Hon. Arad Joy, of Ovid, N. Y., and now in
the War Department, were printed in the <i>N. Y. Tribune</i>. Letters of General Greene are in Greene's <i>Greene</i>,
ii. 227-40, and in the <i>R. I. Col. Records</i>, ix. 246, and in the <i>R. I. Hist. Coll.</i>, vi., and one of R. R. Livingston

In a letter by Clinton, Oct. 11, 1780, to Germain, he details in an accompanying narrative the rise of the
correspondence with Arnold, which began eighteen months before. Sargent notes it as being in the State
Paper Office, "America and West Indies, vol. cxxvi.", and says it has not been printed. The <i>Sparks MSS.</i>
(no. xxxii.) has a copy, where is his next letter of the 12th, telling the story of André's execution, which is
printed in the <i>Remembrancer</i>, vii. part 2, p. 343, and in Dawson, p. 240. Clinton also wrote to Lord Amherst
on the 16th; and on the 30th he wrote a secret letter to Germain, in which he says that he has paid £6,315 to
Arnold (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, xxxii. and xlviii.). Germain's letters to Clinton and Arnold of Nov. 28th and Dec.
7th are in <i>Sparks MSS.</i>, xlviii. On a fly-leaf of Stedman's <i>History of the Amer. War</i>, Clinton, having dissented
to that writer's narrative (vol. ii. p. 249,&mdash;given in Dawson, 196), wrote what he called an extract from
his MS. History of the War, no other portion of which is known. This is printed in Mahon, vii. App.; Sargent's
<i>André</i>; Dawson, p. 177, and Jones's <i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i>, vol. i. App. p. 737. Washington in this
extract is severely criticised, and this is also the case in a pamphlet, <i>The Case of Major John André, who
was put to death by the Rebels, Oct. 2d, 1780, candidly represented, with remarks on said case</i> (pp. 28), New
York, Rivington, 1780,&mdash;a copy in proof-sheets in the Carter-Brown library, being the only one known, and it
has been supposed that it was prepared under Clinton's supervision and suppressed (Sargent, 274; <i>Mag. of
Amer. Hist.</i>, Dec., 1879, iii. 739). The introduction is dated N. Y., Nov. 28, 1780.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Cf. also Simcoe's <i>Mil. Journal of the Queen's Rangers</i>, pp. 150, 292 (in Dawson, 149, 151). Simcoe offered
to try to rescue André. Mahon's <i>England</i>, vii. ch. 62; journal of Gen. Matthews, cited in Balch's <i>Les Français
en Amérique</i>. A long letter on the conspiracy and events attending it, varying in some ways from the
American account, and possibly furnishing Arnold's story, was written by Andrew Elliott to William Eden,
Oct. 4 and 5, 1780, and is among the Auckland MSS. in the Cambridge University library (England). Mr.
B. F. Stevens has furnished to me a printed copy of it. The account in Jones's <i>N. Y. during the Rev.</i> (i.
370) misses or perverts the story throughout, and gives that writer the occasion to abuse Clinton, which he
does not fail to use. Any opinion of Jones is liable to be confused by his cynical and misplaced irony, which
singularly accords with the countenance of the man as portrayed in his picture.</p>

The questions at issue were these: Was André protected by a flag? Arnold says Yes, and André himself
says No. They were the principal parties who could know the fact. If there was a flag, does such use of
a flag come within the purport of the military law which defines flags? Is the question of good faith in flags
one only between the giver and the receiver of a flag, and can the giver of a flag act in good faith to the
receiver and with perfidy to his own principal, with that perfidy known to the receiver? Can the passport of
a general engaged in treasonable correspondence with the enemy protect an officer of that enemy when clothed
in a disguise and bearing papers to the enemy, such as might give that enemy an unfair advantage?</p>
<p class="pfc4">These are questions which Washington and the board of inquiry and all American writers have decided in
the negative. Clinton, in his notes on Stedman already referred to, Cornwallis (<i>Corresp.</i>, i. 78), Simcoe (<i>Mil.
Journal</i>, pp. 152, 294), and other British military writers then, as well as historians like Adolphus (<i>Hist. England</i>,
iii. ch. 39) and Mahon (both in his <i>History</i>, vii., and his <i>Miscellanies</i>), have supported the affirmative
view. The most conspicuous dissent to the general English opinion at the time was Sir Samuel Romilly, in a
letter to Roget, Dec. 12, 1780 (<i>Memoirs</i>, i. 140, quoted in P. W. Chandler, <i>Amer. Crim. Trials</i>). The more
reasonable among the Tories, like Curwen (<i>Journal</i>, p. 323), defended the sentence. Later English military
writers like Mackinnon (<i>Coldstream Guards</i>), and historians like Massey (<i>England</i>, iii. ch. 25) and Lecky
(<i>England</i>, iv. 155), have held that "the justice of the sentence cannot be reasonably impugned;" and this
seems to be the drift of the best current English opinion to-day (cf. Dawson's <i>Papers</i>, 211, etc.; Sargent, p. 413,
who in chapter 22 gives the characters of the members of the board, which English writers have attacked),
though there is an occasional exception. The <i>Saturday Review</i>, for instance, in 1872 (<i>Amer. Bibliopolist</i>, Oct.,
1872), contended that a technical construction of the law should not have guided Washington. The last considerable
discussion of the case was raised by Mahon, whose views were controverted in Chas. J. Biddle's <i>Case
of Major André</i> (<i>Penna. Hist. Soc. Mem.</i>, vi. 317-416, Philad., 1868; <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 193), and in Arnold's
<i>Life of Arnold</i>. Irving (<i>Washington</i>, iv. 101) is the most signal instance among American writers of the
power to hold the judgment apart from sympathetic emotion, when he pronounces André's exploits are "beneath
the range of a truly chivalrous nature." (Cf. Bancroft, x. 393, and <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, Dec., 1885,
p. 620.) There is some evidence to show that André in the spring of 1780 had been a deliberate spy at
Charleston.</p>
<p class="pfc4">If there are any aspects of the circumstances attending the discovery of the plot with which one would willingly
dissociate the name of Washington, it is the countenance which he gave to the proposition to Clinton to
exchange André for Arnold, and his encouragement of the attempt of Sergeant Champe, a little later, to
abduct Arnold from New York. Henry Lee (<i>Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department</i>, ii. 159-187;
R. E. Lee's ed., p. 394) gives the most detailed account of Champe's connived-at desertion, but he evidently
mixes together the later with the earlier incident, and has brought the story in some minds into the category
of myths. Lee's story appeared in New York in 1864 in a separate brochure as <i>Champe's Adventures in attempting
to capture Gen. Arnold</i> (pp. 48). <i>The House Reports, no. 486, Twenty-seventh Congress, 2d session</i>,
ii. (1842), show a petition of "Sergeant-Major Champe" for reward for services. Cf. Sparks's <i>Washington</i>,
vii. 546; Niles's <i>Principles</i>, etc. (1876), p. 307; Arnold's <i>Arnold</i>, 336; Sargent's <i>André</i>, 451; Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>,
ii. 207.</p>

Lincoln's order-books bear witness to the
seriousness of the trouble. Even Moultrie became

The Santee in its upper course as far as the

It seems, however, tolerably certain that he
had greatly overestimated the size of his army,
rating it at seven thousand, while in reality the
returns showed an effective force of only "three
thousand and fifty-two, rank and file." When
Williams explained this to Gates, the latter replied:
"Sir, the number of the latter (privates)
are much below the estimates formed this morning;
but these are enough for our purpose." It
seems never to have occurred to Gates that Cornwallis
would attempt to bring him to action.</p>

What brought these men together is not certainly
known; but a determination to keep the
war away from their homes seems to have been
the main cause of their action. Probably the
threats which Ferguson made, in the vain hope
of intimidating them, may have had a good deal
to do with it.</p>

The court of inquiry into Gates's conduct
was never convened; at first, because it was impossible
to get it together without injury to the
service, since Steuben's presence was necessary.
Later, when Greene became cognizant of the
whole affair, he became convinced that Gates
was the victim of circumstances, and advised
against holding the court.</p>

Afterwards, when his attention was called to
this hazardous position, Morgan declared that
had he passed the Broad River his militia would
have left him. As to the unprotected condition
of his flanks, he asserted that had there been a
swamp in the neighborhood the militia would
have taken refuge in it. He added that he
should have viewed the surrounding of his army
with unconcern, as then his men would have
been obliged to fight it out. In fact, like his
great chief, Morgan had a very poor opinion of
the militia. He placed them in the front rank
with orders to fire at least two shots, and then to
retire behind the regulars, who were posted on
a slight eminence in their rear. A skirmish line
of militia sharpshooters protected the front,
while the cavalry remained in reserve. The best
proof of the excellence of these dispositions is
to be found in the results of the encounter.</p>

Tarleton had some "grasshoppers" at the

In numbers the two commands were about
equal,&mdash;not far from one thousand on either
side, excluding detachments. In discipline and
equipment the British were far superior. Their
defeat was mainly due to the rash impetuosity
of their young commander, to his unwise dispositions,
and especially to his unmilitary conduct
in leading his men into action before the formation
was complete. Above all, however, their
defeat was due to the confidence of Morgan's
men in their leader, to his admirable tactics, and
to the splendid behavior of the Maryland line.
The "unaccountable panick", as Tarleton calls
it, which seized the British infantry, and the poor
use the "Legion" commander made of his horse
contributed in no small degree to the result
which was probable whenever Tarleton should
meet with a real soldier.</p>

A court of inquiry, summoned at Gunby's
request, found that his order "was extremely
improper and unmilitary, and, in all probability,
was the only cause why we did not obtain a complete
victory." At the same time the court declared
that Gunby's spirit and activity were unexceptionable.
This court was presided over by
Huger, or Hugee, as his name is not infrequently
spelled in the old books.</p>

This seizure of Fort Granby greatly displeased
Sumter, who had marked it for himself.
He tendered his commission to Greene, who returned
it with such an effusion of compliments
that Sumter could not refuse to keep it. But
his conduct at a time when it was especially important
for the patriots to act in concert was a
good illustration of the way in which he systematically
thwarted Greene. Before the Cowpens
he had ordered his subordinate to obey no
orders coming from Morgan. And now, instead
of coming to the aid of Greene, when hard
pressed, he contented himself with desultory
operations of no utility in the campaign. They
secured to himself, however, a separate command.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Even Marion, that most steadfast and gallant
leader of Southern militia, was impatient at the
way in which he was treated by the commander-in-chief.
It seems that Greene thought Marion
might easily spare a few horses in order that
Washington's men could be mounted. It will be
remembered that Greene had before this taken
occasion to declaim against the practice of the
Southern irregulars in always wishing to serve
mounted, as it added greatly to the expense.
Marion took the implied censure to himself, and
wrote that as soon as the siege of Motte's was
over he wished to give up his present command
and go to Philadelphia. Greene induced him to
give over his contemplated retirement, and Marion's
reply to Greene's urgent letter furnishes
the real reason for his wish to attain to some
other command than that of "Marion's men",
for whom he appears to have had any but the
kindest feelings. Indeed, the popular idea of
"Marion's men" seems to be far from correct,
for his band was composed largely of renegades,
drawn together by the hope of booty. They deserted
their leader when anything serious was to
be attempted, and this "infamous behavior", as
Marion rightly terms it, was very distressing to
him. However, for a time the storm blew over,
and for the future Lee was regarded as under
Greene's own immediate orders.</p>

It was at this time that Grierson himself
was shot by one of the militia after he had surrendered.
Lee asserts that the murderer could
not be discovered, though a large reward was
offered for his apprehension; but Brown has
declared that his name was well known, and
that he was purposely shielded by the American
commanders</p>

That chieftain showed at this time a disregard
for the orders and wishes of Greene
which counterbalanced whatever good his former
vigorous though unfortunate conduct may
have produced. Instead of acting in harmony
with Marion, and delaying Rawdon by every
means within his reach, Sumter by contradictory
letters neutralized Marion's force, and rendered
his own quite harmless by shutting himself
up in Fort Granby and allowing the British
to march by unopposed. Greene seems never to
have forgiven Sumter for his behavior at this
time; and, indeed, it cannot be too warmly censured.</p>

The Marquis of Rochambeau, in his <i>Memoirs</i>,
took to himself the credit of appointing
the Chesapeake as a rendezvous for the fleet.
He also claims to have intimated to De Grasse
that perhaps it would be best to attack the English
in Virginia. At all events, the French admiral
sent word that he should go into the Chesapeake,
and he hoped, as his stay on the coast
would be short, that the land forces would be
ready to coöperate with him. This decided the
matter. There is in print (dated Mount Vernon,
July 13, 1788; Carey's <i>Museum</i>; also in Niles,
<i>Principles and Acts</i>, 1st ed, p. 273) a letter from
Washington to the effect that, although the point
of attack was not decided on at the outset, the
movement against New York was a feint.</p>

Light-Horse Harry Lee in his <i>Memoirs</i> was
especially severe on Jefferson's actions at this
time, and later during Cornwallis's campaign.
To this Jefferson replied in a letter to the
younger Henry Lee, dated May 15, 1826, in
Lee's <i>Memoirs</i> (2d edition), p. 204. In his
<i>Notes on Virginia</i>, Jefferson attempted a defence
of his conduct, and in his <i>Writings</i> (ix. 212 and
220) there appeared an attack on the elder Lee.
This brought forth a pamphlet entitled <i>Observations
on the Writings of Thomas Jefferson,
with particular reference to the attack they contain
on the memory of the late Gen. Henry Lee</i>, by
Henry Lee, New York, 1832. This was suppressed
(cf. Sabin, x. 172), but in 1839 a second
edition, "with an introduction and notes by
Charles C. Lee", was published. See especially
pp. 119 to 141 of the 1st ed., and pp. 129 to
147 of the 2d. See also Randall's <i>Jefferson</i>,
i. 291-343; Giradin, <i>Continuation of Burk</i>, iv.
452-470; and, on the other side, Howison, ii.

Parton in his interesting life of the Virginia
statesman, pp. 224-256, gives a lifelike picture
of Jefferson's share in the war. He dwells on
the more picturesque incidents, like Tarleton's
raid, which, though giving a pleasant color to
the story, had little influence on the course of
events.</p>

<i>The History of Virginia, commenced by John
Burk, and continued by Skelton Jones and Louis
Hue Giradin</i>, Petersburg, 1816. What part
Jones took in the work is not clear. Volume
iv. relates to the Revolution. The editors of
<i>Jefferson's Works</i> (i. 41) say of Giradin: "Mr.
Jefferson supplied him with a large amount of
manuscript matter which greatly enriched his
volume. His admiration for Mr. Jefferson sometimes
approaches the ludicrous." Cf. also
Howison, ii. 278. The volume closes abruptly
after the capitulation of Yorktown. Further
publication seems to have been suspended on
account of what M. Giradin terms in his preface
"typographical difficulties."</p>

269; and Cornwallis's <i>Answer</i>, App., p.
228. This was followed by <i>The Narrative of
Lieutenant-general Sir Henry Clinton, K. B., relative
to his conduct ... particularly to that which
respects the unfortunate issue of the campaign in
1781, with an appendix containing copies and extracts
of his correspondence with L<sup>d</sup> G. Germain,
Earl Cornwallis</i>, etc. (London, 1783, several
editions. Reprinted in Philadelphia (1865) as
<i>Narrative of the Campaign of 1781 in America</i>
(250 copies).) Next came <i>A Reply to Sir
Henry Clinton's Narrative ... by Themistocles</i>
(Cornwallis?) (London, 1783, two editions), and
<i>An Answer to that part of the Narrative of Lieutenant-General
Sir Henry Clinton, K. B., which
relates to the conduct of Lieutenant-general Cornwallis
during the campaign in North America in
the year 1781, By Earl Cornwallis</i> (London, 1783,
and Philad., 1866). In reply to this appeared
<i>Observations on some parts of the answer of Earl
Cornwallis to Sir Henry Clinton's Narrative by
Lieutenant-general Sir Henry Clinton, K. B.</i>
(London, 1783). In <i>Notes and Queries</i>, Oct. 28,
1882, mention is made of a copy of the <i>Correspondence
between Clinton and Cornwallis</i>, July-Dec.,
1781, with marginal MS. notes by Clinton.

Cf. <i>Ninth Report</i> of the Royal Commissioners,
as above, App., iii. p. 100. Soon after his
arrival at New York, Clinton demanded that
either the admiral or himself should be relieved
(see Eden to Germain, enclosing letters from
Clinton, in <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 106). Arbuthnot asking to
be relieved on account of his advanced age,
the command of the fleet was given to Graves.
Soon, however, Clinton found himself involved
in a similar dispute with a more influential
man. <i>The Seventh Report of the Commissioners
appointed to examine, take, and state
the Public Accounts of the Kingdom</i> appeared
in 1782 (also printed in <i>Parliamentary Register</i>,
xxiv. pp. 517-622). In his evidence before this
board (cf. above, p. 537) Cornwallis repeated
Arbuthnot's charge, and plainly implied that the
final cessation of the plundering was due to his
own efforts. To this Clinton replied in a <i>Letter
from Lieut.-gen. Sir Henry Clinton, K. B. to
the Commissioners on Public Accounts, relative to
some observations in their Seventh Report</i> (London,
1784). The order of Cornwallis, on which
so much emphasis was laid, is in <i>Parliamentary
Register</i>, xxiv. 617. Stedman, as commissary
under Cornwallis, had excellent facilities
for observation. He repeated the old accusations
in a note to his <i>History</i>. Clinton deemed
the attack worth noticing. Cf. his <i>Observations
on Mr. Stedman's History of the American War</i>
(London, 1794; reprinted, New York, 1864). It
is but fair to say that Cornwallis seems to have
done everything in his power to prevent plundering
during his march through North Carolina.
Cf. his "Order-Book" in Caruthers' <i>Incidents</i>,
2d series, App. Cf. further, Clinton's
<i>Memorandum respecting the Unprecedented Treatment
which the Army have met with respecting
Plunder taken after a Siege and of which Plunder
the Navy had more than ample share</i> (privately

Eld, of the Coldstream Guards, from his
arrival at New York, in the summer of 1779,
to March, 1780, at the South (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i>, xviii. 70). There is a statement of Tarleton's
losses in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>, lvi.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>
<p class="pfc4">Tarleton rose to the rank of lieutenant-general.
He was a member of the House of Commons,
1790-1806, and again 1807-1812. Ross,
the editor of Cornwallis's <i>Correspondence</i>, says
(note to p. 44) that "in the House of Commons
he [Tarleton] was notorious for his criticisms
on military affairs, the value of which
may be estimated from the fact that he almost
uniformly condemned the Duke of Wellington."
Cf. also a sketch of his career in <i>Political Magazine</i>,
ii. 61.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is a well-known portrait of Tarleton
by Reynolds (1782), representing him in uniform,
with hat, and his foot on a cannon. It

The number of men nominally under Howe's orders cannot be stated. He probably had not over 700 in
action. Cf. Huger in Moultrie's <i>Memoirs</i>, i. 251. Campbell had with him 3,500 men. Of these 2,500 were
in the fight. The total American loss in this preliminary campaign was not far from 900 killed, wounded, and
missing; while the British do not seem to have lost more than 40 men. Probably many of the Americans
missing sought safety on their plantations. See further returns annexed to the official reports as above; Gordon,

There is a "Sketch of Gen. Robert Howe", by Archibald M. Hooper, in <i>North Carolina University Magazine</i>,

one number, issued in March, 1857." He adds: "I have been told that none others appeared of that volume."
This statement is confirmed by K. P. Battle, the present head of the university. Mr. Draper tells me also
that "there are some valuable Revolutionary papers in the <i>Magnolia</i>, a magazine published in Georgia, and
then in Charleston in ante-war times; some in the <i>Orion</i>, a Georgia magazine; some, I think, in <i>Russell's

This is given entire by Moultrie, who presided over the court (<i>Memoirs</i>, i. 337-354. The finding of the

deficiency of military skill" is not correct, as the court expressly stated that it was of the opinion that "Ashe
did not take all necessary precautions." There is a "Sketch" of Ashe's career in <i>North Carolina University

Prevost had about three thousand men, but of these only two thirds were fit for duty when he retired from
Charleston. Moultrie (<i>Memoirs</i>, i. 430) gives his own force at three thousand one hundred and eighty, including
eight hundred Continentals. According to Prevost, Maitland had at Stono not far from eight hundred

The American loss was one hundred and sixty-two; that of the British one hundred and thirty-one.</p>

Judge Johnson, in his <i>Greene</i>, went out of his way to assert that Pulaski slept at his post just before the
battle at Germantown. In a defence of his former commander, Paul Bentalou put forth the claim that the
retreat of Prevost was due to Pulaski. Unless the documents (cited above) are untrustworthy this claim cannot
be maintained. On the contrary, a gallant charge that the brave Pole made had no other effect than to
dispirit the garrison. Cf. <i>Pulaski Vindicated by Paul Bentalou, a captain in his "legion",</i> Baltimore, 1824,

There are two editions of this book in the Harvard College library bearing the same date. One contains
158 pages, the other 126, but in other respects they seem to be the same. The portion dealing with Savannah,
which Mr. Jones has translated (<i>Siege</i>, pp. 57-76), runs from page 128 to 158 in one edition, and from page 101
to 126 in the other. In Sabin this journal is attributed to D'Estaing. (Cf. Sabin, under Estaing.) There
seems to be no authority for this, and it would certainly be astonishing for an officer to speak of his own conduct
as the writer of this journal constantly speaks of D'Estaing's motives and actions.</p>

It usually precedes Prevost's report, and may also be found in Hough, <i>Savannah</i>, 134, and in White, <i>Hist.

<i>Royal Gazette</i>, Dec. 29, 1779; reprinted by Hough in his <i>Savannah</i>, p. 82. Governor Tonyn, of Florida,

The first (pp. 25-52, with some "additions" running from p. 52 to p. 56) is by an unknown hand. It was
copied from Rivington's <i>Royal Gazette</i>, Dec., 1779. The second journal, which he for convenience calls
"Another Journal" (cf. his <i>Savannah</i>, pp. 57-79), was also copied from Rivington. It appears, however, to
be identical with the "Journal" (Sept. 3d-Oct. 20th) which E. L. Hayward sent to John Laurens in December,
1779,&mdash;reprinted in Moore's <i>Materials for History</i>, N. Y., 1861, pp. 161-173, and in <i>Historical Magazine</i>,

The French, in <i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i> (1878), P. 548, where it is stated that they were "translated from an
original MS. in the possession of Mr. Frank Moore." Lincoln's orders, as then given, are stated to be on the
same sheet and in the same handwriting as those of the French, though in English. A somewhat different
and more accurate copy of Lincoln's orders is printed in Moultrie's <i>Memoirs</i>, ii. 37. Cf. Lincoln's MS. order-book.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There has been much dispute as to the size of the opposing armies. In the report which I have somewhat
incautiously attributed to D'Estaing, the French army actually on shore is given at 2,823 Europeans, 165
volunteers from Cape François, and 545 "volunteer chasseurs, mulattoes, and negroes newly raised at St.
Domingo." The American force is rated at 2,000, or 5,524 men in all. Cf. Hough, <i>Savannah</i>, 173, and
Jones, <i>Savannah</i>, p. 40, note. Moultrie (<i>Memoirs</i>, ii.) increases the number of the Americans to 4,000, while
lowering that of the French to 2,500. Stedman (<i>Am. War</i>, ii. 127) is even wilder when he says that the combined
armies numbered more than ten thousand men, of whom about five thousand were French. In this he is
followed by Mackenzie (<i>Strictures</i>, p. 12), and as both were officers in the force which came South with Clinton,
it is probable that that was the impression prevalent in the British army. Chief-Justice Stokes (<i>View of
the British Constitution</i>, etc., Lond., 1783, p. 116) estimates the Americans at 2,500 and the French at 4,500,
while Jones (<i>Savannah</i>, p. 39) rates the French at 4,456, and the Americans at 2,127. This is probably as
accurate an estimate as can now be made.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The writer of the so-called D'Estaing report says that the force in Savannah was composed of 3,055 English
European troops, 80 Cherokee savages, and 4,000 negroes, or 7,155 men in all. Stedman gives the garrison
at 2,500 "of all sorts", while T. W. Moore says that there were but 2,000 in the town. The legend on
Faden's <i>Plan</i> gives the number at 2,360, while the writer of the first journal in Hough (p. 43) says that there
were but 2,350 "effectives" in the place.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Allies lost in the sortie of the 23d, 24th, or 25th of September&mdash;for the journals differ as to the date&mdash;from
70 to 150 in killed, wounded, and missing. Cf. Jones, <i>Savannah</i>, 22, 53. The writer of the <i>Extrait</i>,
ec. of 158 pages, p. 141, says that this great loss was due to the fact that M. O'Dune, who had the immediate
command at the time, was intoxicated, and pursued the assaulting column too far. The assault of Oct. 9th
cost D'Estaing, according to the <i>Extrait</i> (as above, p. 148), 680 men, while the author of the other journal
translated by Jones gives it as high as 821. The American loss was not far from 312, though Moultrie rates
it at 457, or a total loss of about 1,133 in killed, wounded, and missing. The French suffered severely from
sickness,&mdash;malaria on shore and scurvy in the fleet. So that Captain Henry, when he wrote (<i>Remembrancer</i>,
ix.) that "we have every reason to believe that this expedition cost the enemy two thousand men", was probably
not far from correct. In the document which I have called the D'Estaing report the French losses are
given as follows (Hough, <i>Savannah</i>, p. 174): "Killed, 183; wounded, 454." But the figures have not been
verified by a comparison with the original <i>Gazette</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The English loss in the sortie was very slight,&mdash;not more than twenty-one. Repelling the assault on the
9th cost Prevost 16 killed and 39 wounded. But to these numbers should he added those picked off from time
to time, which swelled the total to 103 in killed and wounded (Prevost's report in <i>Remembrancer</i>, iv. 81). He
lost, in addition, 52 in missing and deserters, or 155 in all. But this was more than counterbalanced by desertions
from the French ranks. It should be stated, however, that T. W. Moore, Prevost's aide, gave the loss of
the garrison in killed and wounded alone at 163.</p>

The former had come into notice during the gallant defence of Fort Moultrie. Later he rendered important
service, and was wounded in the lungs while carrying off the colors from the deadly Spring Hill redoubt
at Savannah. There is no doubt of the truth of this intrepid bravery of Sergeant Jasper. Cf. McCall, <i>Georgia</i>;

<p class="pfc4">The "impetuous Polander" was mortally wounded while making some kind of a charge in the rear of the
enemy's line on the right. As to Pulaski, see, beside the general accounts and C. C. Jones's Address in <i>Georgia
Hist. Coll.</i>, iii., the <i>Life of Count Pulaski</i> by Sparks, in his <i>American Biography</i>, xiv. 365-446; pp.

note in Hough, <i>Savannah</i>, p. 175, abridged from Stevens, <i>Georgia</i>, ii. According to Paul Bentalou, who
claimed to have been with him when he died, his body became so offensive immediately after his death that it
was thrown overboard from the vessel which was bearing the wounded to Charleston. Nevertheless, at the
laying of the corner-stone of a monument to his memory in Savannah, a metallic box supposed to contain his
remains was placed within the plinth alongside the corner-stone. With regard to his place of burial, see Bentalou,
<i>Pulaski Vindicated from a charge in Johnson's Greene</i> (Balt., 1824), p. 29; C. C. Jones, <i>Sepulture
of Major-General Nathanael Greene and of Brigadier-General Count Casimir Pulaski</i>, Augusta, Ga., 1885;

have been aide-de-camp to Pulaski, and to have supported him in the death struggles, says that he was buried
under a large tree, about fifty miles from Savannah.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Maryland Historical Society has the banner presented to Pulaski by the Moravian Sisters of Bethlehem
in 1778. It was saved when Pulaski fell at Savannah in 1779, and came into the possession of the society in
1844 (<i>Penna. Archives</i>, 2d ser., xi.). There is a portrait of Pulaski, engraved by H. B. Hall in Jones's <i>Georgia</i>,
ii. 402. (Cf. Lossing, ii. 735.) The history of efforts to establish Pulaski's service and recompense by the
United States Government is traced in <i>Senate Exec. Doc. 120, 49th Cong., second session</i> (1887).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Printed in various places,&mdash;as, for example, in Hough, <i>Charleston,</i> p. 173; <i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 140. Other
letters from Lincoln to Washington are in <i>Corresp. Rev.</i>, ii. 344, 385, 401, 403, 418, and 433, etc. Some of
them, especially one of April 9th, are of considerable value. Among Lincoln's MSS. is a long letter from
Lincoln to Washington, dated Hingham, July 17, 1780, defending his conduct. It is of value, but, if sent,
has never, to my knowledge, been printed. The reasons for abandoning the defence of the bar are given in a
letter from Captain Whipple and other commanders and pilots to Lincoln, dated Charleston, Feb. 27, 1780, in
Ramsay, <i>Rev. S. C.</i>, ii. 397. See Lincoln MS. defence as above. There are also several papers relating to this
portion of the siege in the third volume of the <i>Commodore Tucker Papers</i> in the Harvard College library.
But see Moultrie (<i>Memoirs</i>, ii. 50) for his strictures on the giving up the position near Fort Moultrie. It is
probable that, had the British fleet been kept out of the Cooper River, the surrender would have been long
deferred, perhaps even until the hot season and the arrival of the French at Newport had compelled its abandonment.</p>

There are several other descriptions from American sources. The most valuable, so far as it goes, is the
report of Du Portail to Washington (<i>Corresp. Rev.</i>, ii. 451). It relates, however, to a limited period. The
same must be said of a few letters from the younger Laurens and from Woodford, the commander of seven
hundred Virginians who arrived on the 21st of April. Laurens's first letter, bearing date of Feb. 25th, is in
Moore's <i>Materials for History</i>, p. 173. The second, written on March 14th, is in <i>Corresp. Rev.</i>, ii. 413. The
third, which bears date of April 9th, is in <i>Ibid.</i> 435. Woodford's letter of April 8th is in <i>Ibid.</i> 430. Cf. also
<i>Ibid.</i> 401, 420, and Moore's <i>Materials</i>, 175.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The contemporary journals of value are: <i>Diary of Events in Charleston, S. C., from March 20 to April
20, 1780, by Samuel Baldwin</i>, in New Jersey <i>Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, 1st series, vol. ii. pp. 78-86,&mdash;Baldwin was a
schoolteacher in Charleston; cf. <i>Ibid.</i> p. 77; <i>Journal of the Siege of Charleston in 1780</i>, by De Brahm
(Feb. 9, 1780-May 12, 1781), in Gibbes, <i>Doc. Hist.</i> (1776-82), p. 124; and <i>Memoirs of Andrew Sherburne,
written by Himself</i> (a "boy" on the American ship "Ranger"), first printed at Utica in 1828, and reprinted
in an "enlarged and improved" form at Providence, in 1831. His curious journal begins on p. 24 of the 1st
ed., and on p. 27 of the 2d. Maj. Wm. Croghan's journal at Charleston, S. C., Feb. 9-May 4, 1780, etc., is
copied in the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>, vol. lx. There are two journals in <i>The Siege of Charleston by the British Fleet
and Army, which terminated in the surrender of that place May 12, 1780</i>, with notes, etc., by Franklin
B. Hough (Albany, 1867). The first is contained in two letters by an unknown hand, and relates to the operations
on Lincoln's line of communications. The author was not present at the siege itself. The other journal
relates to the operations against the town, but it has little value. Indeed, this volume of Hough's is not so
interesting as the similar work on Savannah. Another journal, which relates more especially to the movements
in the country, is the <i>Diary of Anthony Allaire</i>, a lieutenant in Ferguson's corps, printed by Draper
in his <i>King's Mountain and its Heroes</i>, p. 484. Allaire corroborates in a most striking manner the accuracy
of the charges of cruelty and outrage made by the author of the "Notes" in Stedman's <i>American War</i>.
The account of the defence in Johnson's <i>Traditions</i> was written by an eye-witness, though long after the
event. It is often very inaccurate, but nevertheless interesting. The assertion therein made that Gadsden
signed the capitulation, and that therefore all of South Carolina was included in its terms, cannot be substantiated.</p>

According to Lincoln's official report, the Continental troops, "including the sick and wounded", surrendered
prisoners of war at Charleston numbered 2,487. Adding to this the 89 Continentals killed, we have
2,576, or within five of the number of the garrison as given in the <i>New Jersey Gazette</i> for June 23, 1780
(Hough, <i>Charleston</i>, 198). Lincoln says further that at the time of surrender the militia "effectives" did not
exceed 500 men (Lee, <i>Memoirs</i>, i. 141), in all not over 3,000. Clinton, in his report as usually printed, gives
the total as 5,612, or 5,618, "together with town and country militia, French and seamen, make about six
thousand men in arms." In Beatson, <i>Memoirs</i>, vi. 209, the number of seamen is printed as 100 instead of
1,000&mdash;a considerable reduction, and perhaps nearer the mark. Clinton's estimate was further increased in
the royalist newspapers of the time to "between seven and eight thousand men." Lincoln's figures are probably
the nearest to the truth, as all the contemporary writers on the American side insisted that Clinton counted
among his prisoners every man capable of bearing arms in Charleston. At any rate, whatever their number,
the militia, excepting the artillery company, seem to have been of but little service, as their loss in killed and
wounded was not over forty, and in this estimate is included the total loss to those inside the lines not otherwise
accounted for. Lincoln stated his killed at 89, and wounded at 140. But both Ramsay and Moultrie
say that from five to six hundred Continentals were in the hospital at the time of the surrender.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In Beatson's <i>Memoirs</i> (vi. 204) there is a <i>List of the different regiments and corps selected by Sir Henry
Clinton to accompany him on the expedition against Charlestown</i>. It gives the total, exclusive of staff, at
7,550. There were in Savannah at the time about 2,000 more, and the reinforcement which arrived in April
numbered about 3,000 men. Clinton therefore had about 13,000 men at his disposal in May, 1780. Of course, a
large proportion of this force was employed in detachments,&mdash;guarding Savannah, breaking up Lincoln's communications,
and the like; so that it is impossible to say how many men Lincoln had in his front at any one
time.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Clinton's loss from Feb. 11th to May 12th is given by himself at 76 killed and 189 wounded. To this should
be added the loss of the sailors, who seem to have participated in a good many land expeditions,&mdash;23 seamen
killed and 28 wounded, or a grand total of 316. None of these figures include the losses and numbers engaged
in the minor actions. But there is so little data with regard to them that it has seemed best to omit them in
these estimates.</p>

It was widely reprinted, as, for instance, in <i>The New Annual Register</i> for 1780, under <i>Principal Occurrences</i>,
p. 55; <i>Pol. Mag.</i>, i. 455; <i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 41; Tarleton, 38, etc., etc. An abstract under title
of <i>A memorandum</i>, etc., is given in the <i>Ninth Report of the Hist. MSS. Commission</i>, App. ii. p. 109. A
previous report, bearing date of March 9th, has been found,&mdash;<i>London Gazette</i> for April 25-29, 1780; <i>Pol.
Mag.</i>, i. 397; Tarleton, 34; and Hough, <i>Charleston</i>, p. 190. The gap between March 9th and 29th must be
filled from other sources. The instructions as to reducing South Carolina to obedience, from Germain to Clinton
and Arbuthnot, are dated Whitehall, 3 Aug., '79 (<i>Charleston Year-Book</i> for 1882, p. 364). Clinton issued
in all six proclamations, including the one signed by him conjointly with Arbuthnot, as commissioners. The
first was dated at James's Island, March 3, 1780. It promised protection, etc., to all who should take the oath
of allegiance. These protections were given in a most indiscriminate fashion, and caused the complaint of
Cornwallis above noted. The paper was reprinted by Hough in his <i>Charleston</i>, p. 24. Next came the "Handbill",
without date, but sent out soon after the capitulation (<i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 80). The proclamation of May
22d threatened vengeance on all who should prevent the loyalists from coming in (<i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 82;
Ramsay, <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 435; and Tarleton, 71). The most important proclamation, however, and the one to
which Cornwallis took such violent exception, pardoned all not included in a few specified classes (June 1st), and
was signed by the two chief commanders (<i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 85; Hough, <i>Charleston</i>, 178; Ramsay, <i>Rev. S. C.</i>,
ii. 438; Tarleton, 74, etc.). A fac-simile is in <i>Charleston Year-Book</i> (1882), p. 369. The proclamation of June
3d called upon those on parole, with a few exceptions, to give up their paroles, take the oath of allegiance, and
thereby secure "protections" (<i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 82; Hough, <i>Charleston</i>, 182; Ramsay, <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 441;
Tarleton, 73; Moultrie, <i>Memoirs</i>, ii. 384, etc.). <i>The Address of divers Inhabitants of Charleston to Sir
Henry Clinton</i>, June 5, 1780, is (<i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 93; Ramsay, ii. 443; Moultrie, ii. 386, etc.) without names,
which are appended to the copy in Hough, <i>Charleston</i>, 148, where it is stated to be reprinted from Rivington's
<i>Royal Gazette</i> of June 21, 1780. The names, however, are from the <i>Gazette</i> of June 24th. The letters of
Cornwallis on this subject are in his <i>Correspondence</i>, i. 40, 46, and 48. There is a very striking passage in
Moultrie, i. 276, with regard to this business. Cf. also <i>Ibid.</i> 314, and Johnson's <i>Greene</i>, i. 279.</p>

Hough in his <i>Charleston</i> (p. 50) has reprinted a despatch purporting to have been written by Clinton and
addressed to Lord George Germain. It was dated Savannah, Jan. 30, 1780; reprinted in Hough, <i>Charleston</i>,
p. 50; and was said to have been captured by a privateer. In it Clinton described the dispiriting effect on
the royalists of Georgia of D'Estaing's attack on Savannah. It has been regarded as a forgery, partly on this
very account. It probably was a forgery. But it is curious to observe that the opening pages of Tarleton contain
the same statement, and he repents the despatch without a hint as to its being a forgery. And this forms
the ground of Mackenzie's first stricture.</p>

They can also be found in full in the <i>Ninth Report of the Royal Commission on Historical MSS.</i>, Appendix,

x. 267; Tarleton, 128; <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for Oct., 1780; and in many other places. Not
long before the battle, Gates supposed himself to be at the head of 7,000 men,&mdash;Williams in Johnson's
<i>Greene</i>, i. 493,&mdash;while an estimate found in De Kalb's pocket (<i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 279) gives the size of the
American army at some day before the battle at 6,000, less 500 deserters. In this estimate the Virginians were
reckoned at 1,400,&mdash;twice their real number. Jefferson in "Memoranda" (Giradin, iv. 400) gives the total
at 2,800,&mdash;the North Carolina militia being rated at 1,000, far below their real strength. Williams (<i>Narrative</i>,
in Johnson's <i>Greene</i>) gives the "rank and file present and fit for duty" as 3,052. Gordon gives the
total, including officers, as 3,663. If we add to this number the light infantry and cavalry we get a total of
4,033 men of all arms. This is probably as correct an estimate as can be made. Cf. J. A. Stevens in <i>Mag.
Am. Hist.</i> (v. 267), where the subject is fully discussed.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Cornwallis had in the engagement itself 2,239 men, of whom 500 were militia. Cf. <i>Field Return of the
troops under the command of Lieutenant-general Earl Cornwallis, on the night of the 15th of August, 1780</i>,
in <i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 271, etc. This is given by Beatson, <i>Memoirs</i>, vi. 211, as <i>Return of troops ... at the
Battle of Camden</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">As to the American loss, it appears that Cornwallis, without taking much pains to inquire, wrote to Germain
that between 800 and 900 of the enemy were killed and wounded, about 1,000 being prisoners. Even supposing
the wounded to have been counted twice, this is too high. Only three Virginia and sixty-three North Carolina
militiamen are anywhere reported as wounded, while none were killed. In fact, from their speedy dispersal
the militia loss must have been very slight. In any correct return they would have appeared as missing. But
no attempt at such a return was made. The nearest approach to it is <i>A List of Continental Officers, killed,
captivated, wounded, and missing in the actions of the 16 and 18 August, 1780</i>. This is signed by Otho
H. Williams, and is in <i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 338; Ramsay, <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 454. It is erroneously printed in
the <i>N. E. Hist. Geneal. Reg.</i>, xxvii. 376, as a <i>Return of the Killed, wounded, captured, and missing at the
Battle of Camden</i>, which it certainly is not. There were between ten and twelve hundred Continentals
present. They bore the brunt of the action and suffered nearly all the loss. Yet Gates wrote on the 29th of
August that "seven hundred non-commissioned officers and men of the Maryland division have rejoined the
army." See, also, Williams in Johnson's <i>Greene</i>, i. 505. In view of this it seems that even Gordon's estimate
of 730 is too high, while Cornwallis's figures are simply ridiculous. He certainly did not overstate his own
loss when he gave it as 68 killed, 245 wounded, and 11 missing, or 324 in all. Cf. return usually annexed to
his report, and printed separately by Beatson in his <i>Memoirs</i>, vi. 211.</p>

A mystery surrounds the life of De Kalb. But he died as became a man of worth and honor. The fullest
account of his career is <i>The Life of John Kalb, Major-general in the Revolutionary Army, by Friedrich
Kapp</i>, "privately printed" in New York in 1870. In 1884 there seemed to be a revival of interest in the
hero of Camden, and the volume was published. It is a translation of Kapp's <i>Leben des Amerikanischen
Generals Johann Kalb</i>, Stuttgart, 1862. An earlier notice was the <i>Memoir of the Baron de Kalb read at the
meeting of the Maryland Historical Society 7 January, 1858, by J. Spear Smith</i>. Both Kapp and Smith,
from whom Kapp quotes, are unwarrantably severe on Gates, as, too, is G. W. Greene in his <i>German Element
in the War of American Independence</i>, N. Y., 1876, pp. 89-167. See, also, Thomas Wilson, <i>The Biography
of the Principal American Military and Naval Heroes</i>, N. Y., 1817; Headley, <i>Generals</i>, ii. 318;
Lee, <i>Memoirs</i>, i. 378, etc. For an account of the monument to De Kalb, see H. P. Johnston in <i>Mag. Amer.

The editors of Jefferson's <i>Works</i> (q. v. i. 249) omitted this on the ground that the "circumstances of the
defeat of General Gates's army near Camden" are of "historical notoriety." Cf. Giradin's <i>Continuation</i>, iv.
398, where an account probably identical with this is given. It is one of the best descriptions.</p>

The best of this class, perhaps, is that of Colonel Senff, an engineer officer who was with Sumter at the
time. The original is among the <i>Steuben Papers</i>, a portion being printed in <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, v. 275.
See also two letters written by Governor Nash of North Carolina (Tarleton, 149, and <i>Corres. Rev.</i>, iii. 107).
The latter is especially valuable as showing the effects of the disaster on the public mind. Marion also announced
the defeat to P. Horry (Gibbes, <i>Doc. Hist.</i>, 1776-1782, p. 11).</p>
<p class="pfc4">In a letter dated Kennemark, Sept. 5, 1780, Greene describes the defeat from Gates's despatches, which
had not then been made public (<i>R. I. Col. Rec.</i>, ix. 243; <i>R. I. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, vi. 265; and <i>Mag. Amer.
Hist.</i>, v. 279). A more valuable letter on the same subject is one to Reed, written after his arrival in the
South (Reed's <i>Reed</i>, ii. 344). But the most important of these Greene letters is one dated High Hills of Santee,
Aug. 8, 1781 (quoted by Gordon, iv. 98), in which Greene declares that Gates did not deserve the blame with
which his career in the South was so unhappily closed. Moore (<i>Diary</i>, ii. 310) gives several extracts from
accounts of the affair which appeared in Rivington's <i>Royal Gazette</i>. Another contemporary account from
a British source is in Lamb's so-called <i>Journal</i>, pp. 302-307. Lamb was a standard-bearer in a British regiment
at the time, and his narrative seems to have been written while details were still fresh in his mind.</p>

<i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 276; Ramsay, <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 456, etc. Important letters of Gates as to his dispositions
after the action are in <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>, v. 308; <i>Remembrancer</i>, x. 338; <i>Corres. Rev.</i>, iii. 66; <i>Maryland
Papers</i>, 128, etc., etc.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The charges of undue haste and refusal to take the advice of others, so recklessly heaped on Gates by Bancroft
and the writers who have copied him, appear to be without foundation. After a careful examination of
the field, in company with Otho H. Williams, Greene advised against making an inquiry into Gates's conduct,
while "Light-Horse Harry" Lee wrote to Wayne (R. E. Lee's edition of Lee's <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 32) that Gates
"has been most insidiously, most cruelly traduced.... An action took place on very advantageous terms;
we were completely routed." In his <i>Memoirs</i>, Lee censured Gates for not using cavalry. But this, too, seems
undeserved, as a note to page 394 of Giradin's <i>Continuation</i> contains evidence to the effect that Gates could
not get&mdash;though he made every effort&mdash;the cavalry he was blamed for not employing. The most exhaustive
article in his defence is <i>The Southern Campaign, 1780: Gates at Camden</i>, by John Austin Stevens, in <i>Mag.
Amer. Hist.</i>, v. 24-274. It is wholly in favor of Gates, and is so one-sided that it should be read with the
greatest caution. Singularly enough, when he wrote this article, Mr. Stevens, as he acknowledges (p. 424), did
not know of the existence of the Pinckney letter noted above. For the other side, perhaps, nothing is better
than a short, carefully written article by Henry P. Johnston, entitled <i>De Kalb, Gates, and the Camden Campaign</i>,
in <i>Mag. Amer, Hist.</i>, viii. 496, and reprinted without map in Kapp's <i>Kalb</i>, Appendix, p. 322. Of the
more popular accounts, that in Marshall's <i>Washington</i> (iv. 169) is still one of the best. Mention should also
be made of the description in McRee's <i>Life and Correspondence of James Iredell</i>, N. Y., 1857, i. 456-461.
Accounts of more or less value will also be found in Greene's <i>Greene</i>, iii. 17; Johnson, <i>Greene</i>, i. 296; <i>Harper's
Monthly</i>, lxvii. 550; Botta (Otis's trans.), iii. 206; Soulés, <i>Troubles</i>, iii. 285; Allen, <i>Hist. Amer. Rev.</i>, ii.

The first, dated Camden, July 7, 1780, is in <i>Remembrancer</i>, xi. 156, and <i>Pol. Mag.</i>, ii. 339. The more
famous letter, without date, but containing the offer of a reward for the head of every Irish deserter, is in

240. Cornwallis's own version is in his <i>Correspondence</i>, i. 56, and Draper's <i>King's Mountain</i>, p. 140. A
proclamation embodying the British commander's ideas as to confiscation was issued on either the 6th or 16th.
of September, 1780 (Tarleton, 186; Ramsay, <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 460; and <i>Remembrancer</i>, xi. 25). Clinton's reply
to Washington is in <i>Cornwallis Correspondence</i>, i. 60, with Cornwallis's and Rawdon's explanations (pp.
72, 501).</p>

Ramsay was a prisoner at the time, and what he says (<i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 158-173, 288-303) has a considerable
value. A large portion of Moultrie's second volume (pp. 117-201) is taken up with the same subject.
Both of them relied on a letter written to Ramsay by Dr. P. Fassoux, surgeon-general in the hospital at
Charleston. Moultrie declares that the letter "is an exact statement of their conduct in our hospital at that
time." The letter is in Moultrie, <i>Memoirs</i>, ii. 397,&mdash;the indorsement is on p. 277; Gibbes, <i>Doc. Hist.</i> (1781-82),
p. 116; and Ramsay, <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 527. If a tithe of this statement is true, the conduct of the British
officers in charge at Charleston was simply brutal; but the British surgeon denied most of the statements. It
will do no harm to contrast this with the treatment of those taken at Yorktown, as told by one of their own
number, Gen. Graham. Cf. his <i>Memoirs</i>, 66 <i>et seq.</i>, and App. p. 306. English writers have asserted that
papers implicating the Charleston prisoners in a conspiracy to overthrow the government were found in the
pockets of those taken at Camden; but no proof of this has ever been produced. In fact, in his letter of
Dec. 4th Cornwallis alleged as a reason for their removal to St. Augustine that they were so insolent in their
behavior they could not be allowed to go at large in Charleston. Indeed, the prisoners seem to have been
treated with increased harshness after Camden. Before that time everything had been done to induce them
to enlist in the British army. A regiment had been raised, and the command offered to Moultrie, and refused
by that sturdy patriot in a letter which has been printed over and over again. Cf. Moultrie, <i>Memoirs</i>, ii. 166;
Ramsay, <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 289; <i>Charleston Year-Book</i> for 1884; and reprinted as <i>The Correspondence of Lord
Montague with General Moultrie, 1781</i> (Charleston, 1885).</p>

Greene waited till Gadsden and his fellow-prisoners were safe within the American lines; and his officers,
in ignorance of his purpose, remonstrated, Aug. 20, 1781, against this delay (Ramsay, ii. 521; Moultrie, ii. 414;
Greene's <i>Greene</i>, iii. 558; Gibbes, i. 128). Greene's formal proclamation, Aug. 26th, declared that the first regular
British colonel captured should suffer (Ramsay, <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 524; Moultrie, ii. 417, <i>Remembrancer</i>, xiii.
125, etc.). Cf. also Greene to Washington, Aug. 26, 1781, in <i>Corres. of Rev.</i>, iii. 393; Balfour to Greene, Sept.
3, 1781. The letter to which this is an answer I have not found in Ramsay, <i>U. S.</i>, 520, extract; and Gibbes
(1781-82), 168. And see also Greene to Balfour, Sept. 19, 1781, in Gibbes, 168. Before this threat could be
carried out a new commander arrived at Charleston, and the war took on humaner methods.</p>

Pickens to Greene in Johnson's <i>Greene</i>, ii. 135, and Gibbes, <i>Doc. Hist.</i> (1781-82), 91. On the other hand,
Browne, the British commander at Augusta, in a letter to Ramsay, dated Dec. 25, 1786 (White's <i>Hist. Coll.</i>),
asserts that James Alexander, a captain in Pickens's militia, was the murderer whom Pickens shielded. It
would seem that such was the case. See further Johnson's <i>Traditions</i>; McCall's <i>Georgia</i>; Jones's <i>Georgia</i>,

He gives portraits of John Sevier, Shelby, Samuel Hammond, Joseph McDowell, and De Peyster; and a
view of Ferguson's headquarters. W. E. Foster, in his review of Draper, gives references (<i>N. E. Hist. and
Geneal. Reg.</i>, Jan., 1882, p. 92).</p>

See the "report" in Draper, 522; Foote's <i>Western North Carolina</i>, 126; Moore's <i>Diary</i>, ii. 338; and the
newspapers of the time. As to the opposing numbers, Ferguson had when attacked from nine to eleven hundred
men; the Americans numbered a little over nine hundred. But as to the losses, it is within the truth to
say that the British loss was not under seven hundred and fifty in killed, wounded, and prisoners; and it has
been given as high as eleven hundred and three in the official report. There is every reason to suppose that
this was an overestimate. The killed and wounded on the American side did not exceed one hundred, and
may be stated at ninety. This is supposed to have resulted from the fact that the fire of the Tories, being
down-hill, was not so effective as the fire of the patriots in the opposite direction. Draper (<i>King's Mountain</i>,
297) has said all that can be said on this subject. There is an account of Campbell in the <i>Mag. of Western
Hist.</i>, Jan., 1887.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1137_1137" id="Footnote_1137_1137"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1137_1137"><span class="label">[1137]</span></a></span>
Draper, 546; Foote's <i>Sketches of Western North Carolina</i>, 264; and <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>, xi.
552. It forms the basis of the account in Ramsay's <i>Annals of Tennessee</i>, 225. On the whole, this account
is very favorable to Shelby.</p>

Many years before this, a dispute had broken out between the descendants of Campbell and Shelby himself.
The portions of the papers which this brought forth, so far as they relate to King's Mountain, are
reprinted in Draper, 540. What was in some sort a last word was said by John C. Preston, Campbell's
descendant, in his <i>Address delivered at the Celebration of the battle of King's Mountain</i> (printed separately
at Yorkville, S. C., 1855).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Charges of cowardice were also made on the British side. In February, 1781, a writer in the <i>Political Magazine</i>
accused De Peyster of surrendering too soon; but in the same magazine (iii. 609) are documents vindicating
his character. Ferguson's death deprived Cornwallis of a most valuable officer. For Ferguson, see <i>Biographical
Sketch or Memoir of Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Ferguson, by Adam Ferguson</i> (Edinburgh, 1817).
Cf. also <i>Political Magazine</i>, ii. 60; Mackenzie, <i>Strictures</i>, 63; Foote, <i>Sketches of Virginia</i>, 2d series, 129.</p>

This was given to Draper by Allaire's grandson, J. De Lancey Robinson, of New Brunswick. The part
relating to this campaign is in Draper, 505-515. The British Museum has recently acquired a MS. narrative
of one Alexander Chesney, who describes the partisan warfare in Carolina during the Revolution. He was
wounded at King's Mountain.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

There are good accounts in the contemporary books, especially in Ramsay, <i>Rev. in S. C.</i>, ii. 178; Gordon,
iii. 462; Moultrie, ii. 242; Lee, <i>Memoirs</i>, i. 207; Stedman, ii. 220; and Tarleton, 164. Tarleton's account of
Ferguson's campaign was displeasing to Mackenzie; cf. <i>Strictures</i>, 58. It was also very distasteful to Cornwallis,
whom his former subordinate censured. Much can be gleaned from the local histories: W. B. Zeigler
and B. S. Crosscup, <i>The Heart of the Alleghenies or Western North Carolina</i> (Raleigh, N. C., and Cleveland,
Ohio, 1883, p. 219); Hunter, <i>Sketches of Western North Carolina</i>, 300; J. H. Logan, <i>History of the
Upper Country of South Carolina</i> (Columbia, 1859), vol. i., all ever published, p. 68. Cf. also J. W. De Peyster
in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, xvi. 189-197, and <i>Magazine of American History</i>, v. 401-424; Lossing, <i>Field-Book</i>,
ii. 624, and <i>American Historical Record</i>, i. 529; Marshall, <i>Washington</i>, iv. 397; J. C. Hamilton, <i>Hist.
of the Republic</i>, ii. 161; <i>Am. Whig Rev.</i>, 2d series, ii. 580. Bancroft was present at the celebration in 1855,
and made a speech. Cf. <i>Celebration of King's Mountain</i>, p. 75; Moore's <i>Life of Lacey</i>, etc. For poetry
we have a rude ballad by an unknown author,&mdash;cf. Draper, 591; a poem by Paul H. Hayne in <i>Harper's
Monthly</i>, lxi. 942; by W. G. Simms in <i>Ibid.</i> xxi. 670; and a stirring ballad, written shortly after the action,
by an anonymous author in Moore, <i>Songs and Ballads of the American Revolution</i>, p. 335, and Draper, 592.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There is no good plan of this action. Foote (<i>Sketches of Western North Carolina</i>) says that Graham
made "several plots of the ground showing the position of the different bands at different times." One of
these, depicting the situation at the time of the surrender, has been printed. It should have accompanied the
original publication of Graham's account in the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i> (xi. 552), but was omitted.
What I take to be the same is given by Major-General John Watts De Peyster in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>
(xvi. 192), who says that it was first printed in the <i>Southern Lit. Messenger</i>, but when he does not say. He
adds that it was copied in the <i>University of North Carolina Magazine</i>. A plan closely resembling it in
general features is in Ramsay's <i>Annals of Tennessee</i>, p. 238. A fac-simile of this last is in <i>Mag. of Am.
Hist.</i>, v. 414. Draper (page 236) gives a <i>Diagram of the Battle of King's Mountain</i>, in which the corps are
arranged to suit his ideas, together with a map of the neighboring region. There seems to be little doubt but
that Graham's arrangement is faulty, and too favorable to Shelby. As to this officer, cf. <i>Mag. of Western
Hist.</i> (Jan., 1887). Lossing gives views of the field (<i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 629, 634).</p>

Cf. Greene's <i>Greene</i>, iii. ch. 1. The earliest general map of the Southern campaigns from American
sources appeared in David Ramsay's <i>Hist. of the Rev. in So. Carolina</i> (vol. i., Trenton, 1785). Gordon, in
1785, sent this Ramsay map to Greene, asking him to correct it, and lest it should not answer he sent other
maps of the Southern States for Greene to amend (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, xiii. 24, 25). Gordon's own map is in his
third volume, and is reduced in Greene's <i>Greene</i>. Other early American maps are those in Marshall's <i>Atlas</i>
to his Washington, and in Johnson's <i>Greene</i>, vol. ii.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The English maps are <i>A new and accurate map of North Carolina and part of South Carolina, with the
field of battle between Earl Cornwallis and General Gates</i> (London, 1780), and Faden's map of Feb. 3, 1787,
showing the <i>Marches of Lord Cornwallis in the Southern provinces, comprehending the two Carolinas, with
Virginia and Maryland and the Delaware Counties</i> (20 × 26 inches), which is the one also used in Tarleton's
<i>Campaigns</i>. Cf. those in the <i>Political Mag.</i>, Nov., 1780, and Kitchen's <i>Map of the Seat of War</i>, in <i>London
Mag.</i>, 1781, p. 291. There are later eclectic maps in Carrington, 556; <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, lxiii. 324; and in such
lesser works as Ridpath's <i>United States</i>, 342, and Lowell's <i>Hessians</i>, 265. There are French maps in Hilliard
d'Auberteuil's <i>Essais</i>, ii.; Balch's <i>Les Français en Amérique</i>, etc.</p>
<p class="pfc4">There was a map of South Carolina published in nine sheets (London, 1771,&mdash;<i>King's maps, Brit. Mus.</i>,
i. 209). That by James Cook was engraved by Bowen in 1773 (<i>Brit. Mus. Catal. Maps</i>, 1885, col. 699).
Other maps antedating the active hostilities in the South were those in the <i>Amer. Military Pocket Atlas</i>
(1776); the large sheet (56 × 40 inches), with considerable detail, called <i>Map of North and South Carolina</i>,
the work of H. Mouzon and others (London, Sayer &amp; Bennett, 1775); and upon this and Cook's the map in
B. R. Carroll's <i>Hist. Coll. of So. Carolina</i> is based. Sayer &amp; Bennett (London, 1776) published a smaller
map, 19 × 25 inches, called <i>A general map of the southern British colonies in America, comprehending North
and South Carolina [etc.] with the Indian countries. From the modern surveys of de Brahm &amp; others &amp;
from hydrographic survey, by B. Romans, 1776.</i> It has marginal plans of Charleston and St. Augustine.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In 1777 there was published both in London and Paris a large map of South Carolina and Georgia, after
surveys by Bull, Gascoigne, Bryan, and De Brahm. The Paris publisher was Le Rouge, and it was included
in the <i>Atlas Amériquain</i>, which also reproduces the Mouzon map and the English map of the Carolina coasts,
by N. Pocock (1770).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The Bull, etc., map of 1777 was reissued by Faden in 1780 as a <i>Map of South Carolina and a part of
Georgia</i>. Cf. the map of <i>Parts of South Carolina and Georgia</i> in the <i>Political Mag.</i>, i. 454. The <i>Brit.
Mus. Catal. Additional MSS.</i>, no. 31,537, shows four plans, giving positions of the British in South Carolina
from May to September, 1779.</p>
<p class="pfc4">North Carolina alone was not so well mapped as South Carolina at the outbreak of the war. There was
a map published in London in 1770, after surveys by Collet, governor of Fort Johnson (<i>King's maps, Brit.
Mus.</i>, i. 208), and in the same library is a drawn map, also by Collet, of the back country, made in 1768, in
twelve sheets. E. W. Caruthers' <i>Interesting Revolutionary incidents chiefly in the old North State</i>, second
series (Philadelphia, 1856), has a folding map, with the marches of Greene and Cornwallis, from the Cowpens
till the separation at Ramsey's Mill.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The standard map of Virginia at the outbreak of the war was that by Fry and Jefferson (see Vol. V. p. 273),
originally issued in 1751, but reproduced by Jefferys in 1775, and included in his <i>American Atlas</i> (1775, no.
31). In 1777 Le Rouge reproduced it in Paris, and included it in the <i>Atlas Amériquain</i>. Cf. the map of
Virginia and Maryland in Hilliard d'Auberteuil's <i>Essais</i>; and the maps in <i>Political Mag.</i>, i. 787, and <i>Mag.
of Amer. Hist.</i>, vi. 25; and for details those in Simcoe's <i>Journal</i> (giving various skirmishes, etc.), Sparks's
<i>Washington</i>, viii. 158; and Carrington's <i>Battles</i>, p. 616. There is among the Rochambeau maps (no. 51) a
<i>Plan du terrain à la rive gauche de la rivière de James, vis-à-vis Jamestown, en Virginie, où etait le Combat
du 6 Juillet, 1781</i>, giving the first and second positions of the troops in the engagement between Lafayette and
Cornwallis. It is a colored map, 18 × 18 inches, with a good key. Cf. map on the operations in Virginia in
<i>Mémoires</i> of Lafayette (Paris, 1837), vol. i.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<i>Greene</i>, iii. 139; <i>Travels in North America in the years 1780, 1781, and 1782. By the Marquis de Chastellux&mdash;translated
from the French by an English Gentleman</i> (London, 1787), ii. 60. The marquis claimed
to have derived his account from Morgan, but he probably did not understand him, as his description is at
variance with the best authorities. There are accounts of more or less value in McSherry, <i>Maryland</i>, 276;
<i>Memoir of General Graham</i>, p. 38; Marshall, <i>Washington</i>, iv. 342; Lossing, <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 636; Carrington,
<i>Battles</i>, 546; <i>Historical Magazine</i>, xii. 356 (Dec., 1865), a "traditionary account;" <i>Harper's Monthly</i>, xxii.
163, etc. Probably as good an estimate as can be formed of Morgan's force is that contained in a letter from
Greene to Marion of January 23, 1781. He there gives it at 290 infantry and 80 cavalry of the line, and about
600 militia; total, 970. The estimate of the militia is too high, and might be reduced by 100. Then, too, there
were a few small detachments. So that Morgan's assertion in his official report, that he fought with only 800
men, is not incompatible with this statement of Greene's. The British brought, or should have brought, into
action at least 1,000 men, including 50 militia and a baggage-guard, which made off, without striking a blow,
as soon as the news of the defeat reached it. Greene rates Tarleton's force at 200 more. But 1,000 was
probably not far from his number of "effectives" on the morning of Jan. 17, 1781, as opposed to Morgan's 800.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In his official report Morgan gave his loss as 12 killed and about 60 wounded. He states, however, that he
was not able at the time of writing to ascertain the loss of the militia in the skirmish and front lines. It
must have been very small, however. The British loss he gives as more than 110 killed, more than 200
wounded, and between 500 and 600 prisoners. Morgan states, however, that, as he was obliged to move off
the field so quickly, the estimate of killed and wounded was very imperfect. The loss of the British in officers
was very large, and it is safe to follow Graham (<i>Life of Morgan</i>, p. 308) and place the killed at 80, the
wounded at 150, and the prisoners at 600. The important fact is the deprivation to Cornwallis of his light
infantry at a time when he was sorely in need of such.</p>
<p class="pfc4">A good plan will be found in Johnson's <i>Greene</i>, i. 378, of which a reduced fac-simile is given by Graham (p.
297). A more valuable plan as coming from an actual observer, Colonel Samuel Hammond, is in Johnson's
<i>Traditions</i>, pp. 529, 530. The best plan is in Carrington's <i>Battles</i>, p. 547. The medals given to Morgan,
Colonels Washington and Howard are figured in Loubat's <i>Medallic Hist. of the U. S.</i>, and in Lossing's
<i>Cyclop. U. S. Hist.</i>, p. 341. Lossing, <i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 637, gives a view of the field.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Those from Morgan are in Graham's <i>Morgan</i>, 328 <i>et seq.</i> The most interesting letter from Greene is one
that he wrote to Reed (March 18), in Reed's <i>Reed</i>, ii. 348. A letter to Washington (Irwin's Ferry on Dan,
Feb. 15, 1781) may be regarded as his official report. Cf. <i>Corres. Rev.</i>, iii. 233. It should be read in connection
with one of six days earlier, in the same volume, p. 225. Cf. also a letter to Lieutenant Lock as to militia
in <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, v. 86; Caruthers' <i>Incidents</i>, p. 195; originally printed in Tarleton, 252. Lee's description of

<i>North Carolina University Magazine</i>, vol. vii. 193. This was written in 1824 and cannot be regarded as
authority of the first importance. The passage relating to this affair is quoted by Caruthers, <i>Incidents</i>, 76.
That author's own account is derived to a great extent from tradition (<i>Incidents</i>, 71 <i>et seq.</i>). In the above
letter Graham asserted that he saw Eggleston&mdash;the leader of Lee's rear troop&mdash;strike a Tory with the butt of
his pistol, and that the blow brought about the conflict. The different narratives cannot be reconciled. Very
likely Lee had forgotten the exact details. It is certain that Stedman (<i>Amer. War</i>, ii. 333), in his estimate of
the Tory loss in killed alone at between two and three hundred, more than doubled the actual number; but
it was a murderous business at best.</p>

Cornwallis's report to Germain (<i>London Gazette</i>, June 2-5, 1781) was widely reprinted (<i>Corn. Corr.</i>, i.
506; Cornwallis, <i>Answer to Clinton's Narrative</i>, App. p. 35; <i>Remembrancer</i>, xii. 21, etc., etc.). He also
wrote a friendly note to Rawdon, in which he says that after a very sharp action he had routed Greene
(<i>Corn. Corr.</i>, i. 85; <i>Remembrancer</i>, xi. 332; <i>Polit. Mag.</i>, ii. 329, etc.). Balfour communicated the news of
the "victory at Guilford" to Germain in two letters, dated respectively March 24 and 27. These last three
letters arrived in London in season to be published in the <i>Gazette Extra</i> for May 11, 1781,&mdash;nearly a month
before the official report was given to the world. Cf. also <i>Remembrancer</i>, xi. 329. Cornwallis's <i>Order-book</i>
is very valuable for this period, although it is often hard to reconcile the dates as there given with the accepted
accounts,&mdash;in Caruthers, <i>Incidents</i>, 2d ser. pp. 391-442. See also St. George Tucker to Fanny (his

action at Guilford, March 15, 1781, as, in the field with him, 2,700; in his department, 6,000 in all (<i>Sparks

Good descriptions are in the <i>Memoirs</i> of the British Graham (pp. 41-46), in Gordon (iv. 53), and in Stedman

Another apologetic description is that in McSherry's <i>Maryland</i> (p. 286). The plain fact is that the 2d
Maryland broke and contributed materially to the defeat of the Americans. The Grenadier Guards (Hamilton,
ii. 247) did excellent work on the British side, and the account in the history of that corps is good. The
Hessians, too, once more appeared on the Southern fields (Eelking, <i>Hülfstruppen</i>, ii. 101, and Lowell, <i>Hessians</i>,
268). Other accounts may be found in Marshall's <i>Washington</i>, iv. 336; Greene's <i>Greene</i>, iii. 176;

Rawdon's order which brought on the battle is in <i>Pol. Mag.</i>, ii. 340. The British commander reported
to Cornwallis (<i>Corn. Corr.</i>, i. 97, and <i>Remembrancer</i>, xv. 1); Balfour to Germain (<i>London Gazette</i>, June 2-5,
1781; reprinted in <i>Annual Register</i> for the same year under Principal Occurrences, p. 71; <i>Pol. Mag.</i>, ii. 380;
<i>Remembrancer</i>, xii. 27; Tarleton, p. 465; etc.). On the 6th Balfour wrote to Clinton, giving a very gloomy
account of affairs (Clinton, <i>Observations on Cornwallis</i>, etc., App. p. 97). Clinton enclosed several letters of
about this time to Germain (<i>Remembrancer</i>, xii. 151). In a letter to Cornwallis, dated Monk's Corner, May
24, Rawdon describes his movements after the fight. It is a valuable letter (<i>London Gazette</i>, July 31-Aug. 4,
1781; <i>Remembrancer</i>, xv. 4, while extracts are in <i>Ibid.</i> xii. 151; <i>Pol. Mag.</i>, ii. 482; Tarleton, 475; Clinton,

As to numbers, Greene thought that the two armies were about equal,&mdash;one thousand on each side. This is
probably nearly correct; for Rawdon gave his own number at 960, and Gordon, on the authority of returns
not now accessible, rated Greene's force at 1,194 men of all arms. This included 254 North Carolina militia
who had just arrived. They were not included in the battle line. Williams reported the American loss at
268; but 133 of these are given as missing, with the remark that they probably had mistaken the order as to a
place of rendezvous. Rawdon reported his own loss at 220 men. But Tarleton, on the authority of a return
in the <i>Annual Register</i>, gives it at 258. The discrepancy is not material.</p>

but this is very possibly too low. Cruger had 550 men when the siege began. The British account in Mackenzie
rates Greene at 5,000, which estimate is absurd. It was not under 1,000 nor over 1,500, including
militia. Williams reported the loss at 57 killed, 70 wounded, and 20 missing. Rawdon had "near 2,000"
men. Of these 7 were placed <i>hors de combat</i> on the way up, "50" died of the heat, and Lee captured 250 of
the cavalry on the homeward march,&mdash;a total loss of 307.</p>

p. 344. Jones in his <i>New York during the Revolutionary War</i> (ii. 463) says that Clinton, distrusting Arnold,
gave dormant commissions to Dundas and Simcoe. The commissions were never used; but Simcoe in his
<i>Military Journal</i> (ed. of 1787, pp. 108-146; ed. of 1844, pp. 158-208) gave a narrative of the whole movement,

fortify himself, according to E. E. Hale (<i>Franklin in France</i>, 463).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

The <i>Tenth Report of the Royal Commission on Hist. MSS.</i> (App. i. p. 29) contains two letters still further
lessening the responsibility of Clinton for the disaster. In the first, from Lord George Germain to Clinton,
the latter is given "positive orders to push the war in the South." The projected withdrawal of Arnold
and Phillips is not approved. This is dated May 2, 1781. In the second letter, also from Germain, Clinton
is advised that the French fleet will sail to America, and that Rodney will follow it. This letter is dated July
7, 1781. It is not stated whether Clinton ever received these notes. If he did receive them, he certainly
must have felt obliged to continue the war in the South.</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the <i>Fifth Report of the Commission on Hist. MSS.</i> (p. 235) there are three letters written by "Sir H.
Crosby" and "Sir H. C.", which the editor takes to stand for Sir H. Crosby. At least one was written by
Clinton, and the probability is that all were written by him. The first (N. Y., July 18, 1781) relates to the
proceedings of Cornwallis, and gives a statement of the troops under some of the British generals in America,
and an estimate of the number of French troops which Washington has within call. The third (to G. G.,
dated Dec., 1781) is plainly the work of Clinton, as the author says that, from the tone of Cornwallis's letter
of Oct. 20 (his official report), it might be supposed that the author was to blame for the selection of the
post at Yorktown. In the last, also written in December, 1781, the writer attributes the disaster to the want
of promised naval supremacy under Sir G. Rodney. He also gives Cornwallis's explanation of the passages
complained of in his report. Cf. also Jones's <i>New York during the Rev. War</i>, ii., notes to pp. 464-470, where
the editor gives extracts from Clinton's annotations of a copy of Stedman's <i>American War</i>. S. H. Gay (<i>N.
Am. Rev.</i>, Oct., 1881) follows Cornwallis's movements previous to his fortifying at Yorktown.</p>

Yet in 1668-9 the colony of Massachusetts
had sent a ship-load of masts to Charles II.;
and at the end of the century, Bellomont, in
one of his despatches home, says that from the
port of Boston there sailed more vessels built
in New England than belonged to all Scotland
and Ireland. Bellomont urged on the home
government the importance of making in America
their own tar and pitch. New Hampshire
was already sending masts, yards, and bowsprits
to England, and Bellomont shows the government
how they could save by carrying them for
themselves. This was in 1700 and 1701.</p>

The steps leading to this action of Washington,
who felt authorized to take it by giving
a liberal interpretation to his commission, were
these: As early as June 7, 1775, the Massachusetts
legislature had considered the question of
creating a naval force, but moved cautiously
(Frothingham's <i>Siege of Boston</i>, p. 111). Rhode
Island moved first, June 12th, and put two vessels
in commission under Abraham and Christopher
Whipple, and in July they were cruising.
(On this and other early movements in Rhode
Island, see Arnold's <i>Rhode Island</i>, ii. 351, 363,
369, 386; Staples's <i>Annals of Providence</i>, pp. 265-70;
<i>R. I. Hist. Coll.</i>, vol. vi.; Gammell's <i>Life
of Samuel Ward</i>; and Ward's journal in <i>Sparks
MSS.</i>, lxviii. no. 7.) By July 1st Connecticut
had begun to move. Washington's first commission
was given to Capt. Nicholas Broughton,
of Marblehead, accompanied by instructions,
which are given in Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, iii. 517,
when he took command of the "Hannah"
(Frothingham's <i>Siege of Boston</i>, 260). John Adams
says (<i>Works</i>, x. 27; <i>Letters of Washington
to John Langdon</i>, 1880, p. 19) it was John Manly's
application to Washington for authority to
fit out a cruiser that led directly to this step,
and that Manly was the first to fly a Continental
flag, and to have a British flag struck to him.</p>

Rhode Island, as she had put the first armed
vessel afloat, was also the inciter of the movements
in Congress which resulted in this fleet,
her members, in Oct., 1775, having urged action
(4 Force, iv. 1838). John Adams gives on the
successive stages of the movement (<i>Works</i>, ii.
463, iii. 7. Cf. Gammell's <i>Ward</i>, 316, and the
<i>Journal of Congress</i>, 1775). A naval committee
was instituted Oct. 13th, and in December it was
enlarged, to have a member for each colony.
John Adams tells on his labors on this committee
were the most agreeable he had in Congress;
and he always took great credit to himself for
being mainly instrumental in committing Congress
to naval policy (<i>Works</i>, ix. 363, <i>Familiar
Letters</i>, 166), and it was he who drew up the
Rules of the naval service (<i>Works</i>, iii. p. 11;
<i>Journal of Congress</i>, 1775, p. 282). In tracing
the official action of Congress towards the navy,
beside the <i>Journals</i>, use the index of Ben: Perley
Poore's <i>Descriptive Catal. of Government Publications</i>;
the indexes to the <i>Amer. Archives</i>,
under such heads as "armed vessels", "fleet",
"Mass. armed vessels", "marine committee",
"navy", "privateers", "prizes", "row galleys",
"seamen", "vessels", and the names of naval
characters. The incongruous character of Force's
indexes increases the labor considerably in using
the <i>Archives</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The beginnings of the navy, beside being followed
in Cooper, Clark, etc., can be traced in

over the armed fleet after the evacuation of
Boston in March, 1776. General Ward, who

Few of the earlier captains made more captures
than Samuel Tucker. Washington commissioned
him in Jan., 1776. His reputation as a naval officer
was mostly made during his command of the
frigate "Boston", in one of whose voyages he
took John Adams to France in 1778. The log
of this voyage is preserved in Harvard College

The government of South Carolina gave
him four war-vessels of their own, and early in
1778 he went out to meet the English blockading
squadron of four vessels, hoping to find himself
of superior force to them. He did not meet the
squadron, but east of the Barbadoes, on the 7th of
March, he did meet the "Yarmouth", sixty-four
guns, and, apparently relying on the four small
vessels he had with him, he bravely engaged
her. But after an action of twenty minutes the
"Randolph" blew up, nor was it until five days
after that a part of her crew were picked up by
the "Yarmouth" on a piece of the wreck. The
other vessels of Biddle's squadron escaped.</p>

<p class="pfc4"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;This will inform you of my
safe arrival after a tolerable successful cruise,

one ship. The Snow is a Falmouth Packet
bound from thence to Lisbon. She is mounted
with 16 guns and had near 50 men on board.
She engaged near an hour before she struck.
I had one man killed. My first Lieut. had his
left arm shot off above the elbow, and the Lieut.
of Marines had a musquet ball lodged in his
wrist. They had several men wounded, but
none killed. I am in great hopes that both my
wounded officers will do well, as there are no
unfavorable symptoms at present. Three of our
Prizes are arrived, and I expect the other two
in to-morrow. As I am informed that there has
been two American Private ships of war lately
taken and carried into England, I think it would
be a good opportunity to negotiate and exchange
prisoners, if it could be done; but I submit to
your better judgment to act as you think proper.
I should be very glad to hear from you as soon

"This will inform you", he writes on the
12th of August, "of my present unhappy situation.
The Judges of the Admiralty have received
orders of the 6th inst. from the Minister
at Paris, ordering them not to suffer me to take
any cannon, powder, or other military stores on
board, or to depart from this port on any consideration
whatever, without further orders from
Paris. In consequence of these orders, they
came on board on Saturday to take all my cannon
out and to unhang my rudder. I have prevented
this for the present by refusing to let
them take rudder or cannon without producing
an order from the minister for so doing. As I
told them, my orders corresponded with theirs
in regard to continuing in port, but I had no
order to deliver anything belonging to the ship
to them, which I would not do without orders,
and if the ministers insisted on it, made no
doubt but you would give your orders accordingly,
which would be readily complied with on
my part when such orders were received. My
powder is stopped, and they have been contented
with taking my written parole not to depart
until I receive their permission."</p>

The table on a later page shows that there
were nearly 90,000 Continentals and militia on
the rolls at different times during 1776; but it is
not probable that 70,000 were in service at any
single time, and the terms of service were short.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

There is a curious difficulty as to the name
of this little vessel. In printed histories she is
sometimes called the "Penet" and sometimes
the "Perch." There is no question that the
State owned a vessel called the "Penet", which
was named from one of the mercantile agents in
Nantes. But, after a careful examination of the
manuscript of the journals of Mr. Austin, who
carried the news, we are satisfied that the vessel
was the "Perch", and that she is called the
"Penet" in some of the manuscripts only from
an error of the early copyists.</p>

A third edition was printed at Cooperstown in 1848. Editions with revisions and additions were issued
at New York in 1853 and 1856, use being made in part of matter collected by Cooper himself. An abridged
edition was published in New York in 1856. There were other editions in London, Paris, and Brussels.
Cooper's <i>Lives of distinguished Naval Officers</i> (Philad., 1846) includes only Paul Jones of the Revolutionary
period.</p>

There are a few accessory books: J. Rolfe's <i>Naval Biography during the Reign of George III.</i> (London,
1828, in two volumes,&mdash;Sabin, xvi. 67,601). <i>The Detail of some particular services performed in America
during the years 1776-1779</i> (printed for Ithiel Town, N. Y., 1835,&mdash;Sabin, v. 19,775) had previously appeared
in <i>The Naval Chronicle</i>, and consists, in the main, of a journal supposed to be kept on board his
Majesty's ship "Rainbow", while under the command of Sir George Collier, on the American coast. Town
says that the book was privately printed from a manuscript obtained by him in London in 1830, and it is said
that all but seventy copies were destroyed by fire. There is a copy in Harvard College library, and others
are noted in the Brinley (no. 4,002) and Cooke (no. 708) sales.</p>
<p class="pfc4">John Adams sent to Congress in 1780 an account of the naval losses of Great Britain from the beginning of
the war (<i>Diplom. Corresp.</i>, iv. 483, v. 234). A similar statement (1776-1781) on the British side is in the

In January, 1763, peremptory orders were
sent from England to the governor and company
of Connecticut to put a stop to the Susquehanna
settlement. In September of the same
year, Governor Fitch wrote to the board of trade
that he had strictly obeyed the orders; that a
delegation from the Six Nations had been received,
and in the presence of the assembly he
had announced the commands of his majesty;
that this had apparently satisfied the natives.

In Proud's <i>History of Pennsylvania</i>, ii. p.
326, there is a note containing an extract from
an "authentic publication", entitled <i>A narrative

a member of Indians, friends of this Province</i>
(Philadelphia, 1764). In this narrative (which
was written by Franklin,&mdash;cf. Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>,
i. 273; iv. 56), religious enthusiasm, "chiefly
Presbyterian", is the alleged motive for the
outbreak. See, also, a reprint of a curious

In Reed's <i>Reed</i>, i. p. 35, there is a letter from
Dr. John Ewing, coolly discussing this transaction,
as if it were a laudable attempt on the part
of the frontier inhabitants to relieve themselves
in a perfectly justifiable way from a source of
danger. He says, "there was not a single act of
violence, unless you call the Lancaster affair
such, although it was no more than going to war
with that tribe."</p>

The Conestogoes belonged to the Five Nations,

The question of the rights of Indian women
in lands of the tribes forms part of the discussion
in the paper by Lucien Carr, entitled "The
social and political condition of women among
the Huron-Iroquois tribes." (<i>Report xvi. of the
Peabody Museum</i>, pp. 216-218.) Instances are
on record where transfers were compelled by the
women in opposition to the wishes of the chiefs,
and where they prevented sales, the terms
of which had been arranged by the men. At
the conference at Canajoharie Castle in 1763,
where the Mohawks submitted one of their numerous
complaints against settlers for stealing
their lands, all the women present interrupted
the speaker, and declared that they "did not
choose to part with their lands and be reduced
to make brooms for a living." The fraudulent
transfers alluded to in the text had already
attracted the attention of the authorities. By
proclamation, dated October 7, 1763, the king
had forbidden private individuals to purchase
land from Indians.</p>

"After the peace, numbers of the frontier inhabitants

violation of British faith and the strength

Indians of good character, and still continue to
do so, vowing vengeance against all that come
in their way; whilst others forcibly established
themselves beyond even the limits of their own
governments in the Indian country."</p>

At this date the Mohawk Valley, as far
west as the boundary line, was jointly occupied
by the whites and the Mohawk tribe. Immediately
to the west of that line, in the neighborhood
of Oneida Lake, lived the Oneidas. Both
Mohawks and Oneidas had extensive hunting-grounds
to the north. The Onondagas, Cayugas,
and Senecas severally lived upon the lakes
which to-day bear the names of those tribes.
The Tuscaroras occupied land which had been
allotted them immediately to the south of the
Oneida country, and had also a section on the
Susquehanna. [See Colden's map in Vol. IV.
491, and the maps in Vol. III. 281, 293.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.]
The whole number of the confederacy did not
exceed 10,000 souls, of whom 2,000 were warriors,
more than one half being Senecas. The
most conspicuous tribe among the Ohio Indians
was the Shawanese. They were a source of terror
to the Virginia settlers, and had a hand
in most of the invasions of Kentucky, Virginia,
and Pennsylvania. They numbered about 300
warriors, and lived in Ohio on the Scioto and
its branches. The Delawares, counting 600
warriors, were scattered from the Susquehanna
Valley to Lake Erie; 200 Wyandots lived near
Sandusky. These and other tribes living on
the border or in Canada, who were classified
as allies of the Six Nations, numbered in all
about 2,000 warriors. The other tribes living
east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio,
with whom the British had dealings, or of
whom they had knowledge, were classified as
the "Ottawa Confederacy, comprehending the
Twightwees or Miamis", and numbered about
8,000 warriors, of whom 3,000 lived near Detroit.
In all, there were, according to this estimate,
which is from Sir William Johnson's
papers, about 12,000 warriors. [See Sketch map
in Vol. IV. 298.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
<p class="pfc4">A similar computation of the "gun-men or
effectives" in the South, made by Sir James
Wright in 1773, shows that over 9,500 men
could be furnished by the Choctaws, Creeks,
Cherokees, and Catawbas. From other sources
we have estimates which include tribes omitted
by the above authorities, from which it would
appear probable that there were about 35,000
warriors east of the Mississippi, in the United
States and across the straits at Detroit. There
is a difference of opinion as to the proportion of
warriors to the total population. Apparently the
proportion varied in different tribes. Some observers
have placed the number as high as six to
one; others, as low as three to one. Between
four and five to one appears to be about the
number furnished by the averages of the best
observers. This will give for a total Indian population
east of the Mississippi, in the United
States and along the lakes near Detroit, at the
beginning of the Revolutionary War, 150,000
persons.</p>

"My intelligence informs me", wrote Governor
Penn to Lord Dunmore, March 1, 1775,

Guy Johnson refers to the success of his
interference on this occasion in his letter to the
magistrates and others of Palatine, Canajoharie,

Accustomed as the inhabitants of the Northern
colonies had been to coöperating with Indians
in the several wars with the French, the
proposition to make use of their services did
not excite the universal feeling of horror which
would be aroused by the same proposition to-day.
On the contrary, it was regarded as a
natural and inevitable condition attached to the
war that the natives should be engaged upon
the one side or the other; and rumors of the
friendly disposition of this tribe, and of the
number of warriors which that tribe would furnish
to the cause, found their way into the
journals of that day. It was evident that Indian
auxiliaries would be of greater military
value to the English than to the Americans.
The English army would be practically an army
of invasion. There were no English homes
exposed to destruction. The use of savages by
the Americans would not keep out of the field
a single Englishman for the protection of the
scalps of his family. Nevertheless, it was felt
by the colonists that all the tribes that could be
secured would be an advantage gained. Such
evidently was the opinion of the men composing
the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts Bay,
who first met the question, and, even before
the battle of Lexington, solved it by employing
some of the Stockbridge Indians as minute-men.
The records of that body go far towards
justifying the statement made by Gen. Gage at
Boston (June 12, 1775), that the "rebels" were
"bringing as many Indians down here as they
could collect."</p>

In this letter to Kirkland the assertion is
made that the step was taken because of information
received that "those who are inimical
to us in Canada have been tampering with
the natives." In the <i>American Archives</i>, 4th
series, ii. p. 244, is a letter dated Montreal,
March 29th, from J. Brown to Samuel Adams
and Joseph Warren, Committee of Correspondence
of Boston, in which Brown's mission is
betrayed even without his credentials. He was
prospecting the ground with a view to future
operations. He reports that "the Indians say
they have been repeatedly applied to and requested
to join with the king's troops to fight
Boston, but have peremptorily refused, and still
intend to refuse. They are a simple politick
people, and say that if they are obliged, for
their own safety, to take up arms on either
side, they shall take part on the side of their
brethren the English in New-England." In
the same letter Brown states as a secret that
Ticonderoga must be seized on the beginning
of hostilities. Samuel Adams, one of the committee
to whom Brown's letter was addressed,
was also a member of the committee which
drafted the letter to Kirkland. If Brown's letter
did not reach Adams in time to inspire the
suggestion of "tampering", it indicates at least
the character of the rumors. The English
writers (like Mahon, vi. 35) look upon the plea
of "tampering" as a pretence; and Dartmouth,
in July and August, 1775, called his orders retaliatory
ones. We know that there was little for
the colonists to apprehend from Carleton on
this score. His opposition to the enlistment of
Indians for service outside Canada drew forth
complaints afterward from Guy Johnson (<i>N. Y.
Col. Docs.</i>, viii. p. 636). Still less was there
cause for apprehension if the Caughnawagas
were going to take sides with the colonists.
It was probably understood that the statements
of these Canadian Indians could not be implicitly
relied upon.</p>

The enlisted Indians are occasionally heard
from during the war, although their services
were not conspicuous. Their fondness for liquor
soon brought them into trouble, and we find that
a petition signed by seventeen of them was presented
to the Provincial Congress, asking that
liquor might be kept out of their way. This
petition was duly granted. (<i>Am. Arch.</i>, 4th ser.,
ii. pp. 1049 and 1083.) During the siege of Boston
they occasionally killed a sentry (<i>The Boston
Gazette and Country Journal</i>, Aug. 7, 1775;
Frothingham's <i>Siege of Boston</i>, pp. 212, 213). In
<i>Mass. Archives</i>, vol. lvi. (special title, "Coat
Rolls, 8 Months' Service, 1775&mdash;vol. i. Rolls"),
no. 173, is a copy of what purports to be an order
for bounty money, etc., signed by thirty-two persons.
Appended is the following: "Camp at
Charlestown, March 12, 1776. This may certify
that the within named persons were soldiers in
my Regiment, and served as such in the service
of this province last summer, until they were
discharged by his Excellency Gen. Washington.
Attest, John Paterson, Col. These Indians belonged
to Capt. William Goodrich's Company.
Attest, John Sargent." Some of them, under
the command of Captain Ezra Whittlesey, were
"posted at the saw-mills", Sept. 13, 1776 (<i>Amer.
Arch.</i>, 5th series, ii. p. 476). If Guy Johnson is
to be believed, there were enlisted Indians in
the battle of Long island, and some of them
were taken prisoners (<i>N. Y. Coll. Doc.</i>, viii. p.
740). Washington applied for them for scouting
service, Oct. 18, 1776 (<i>Amer. Arch.</i>, 5th series,
ii. p. 1120); Jones (<i>Annals of Oneida
County</i>, p. 854) says that a considerable party of
Oneidas participated in the battle of White
Plains, and that a full company of Stockbridge
Indians, under Captain Daniel Ninham, went to
White Plains (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 888). A capture by Indians
of six prisoners is reported in Moore's
<i>Diary</i>, etc., i. p. 476. The Stockbridge Indians
were ambuscaded at King's Bridge with severe
loss, Aug. 31, 1778. (<i>Mag. Am. Hist.</i>, v. p. 187.)
In 1819, the survivors of this tribe, petitioning
the President of the United States for the protection
of their rights in certain lands in Indiana,
said: "When your parent disowned you as her
children, and sent over to this great island many
strong warriors to burn your towns, destroy
your families, and bring you into captivity, we,
of the Muhheakunuks, defended your fathers on
the west against the warriors which your parent
had sent against you on that side; and we
also sent our warriors to join your great chief,
Washington, to aid him in driving back into the
sea the unnatural monsters who had come up
from thence to devour you, and ravage the land
which we a long time before granted to your
fathers to live upon." (<i>American State Papers&mdash;Public
Lands</i>, vol. iii., Washington, 1834).</p>

On the 24th of May, Ethan Allen addressed
a letter to several tribes of the Canadian Indians,
asking their warriors to join with his warriors
"like brothers, and ambush the regulars." This
proceeding he reported to the General Assembly
of Connecticut two days afterward. On
the 2nd of June, Allen proposed to the Provincial
Congress of New York an invasion of Canada,
urging as one of the reasons therefor that there
would be "this unspeakable advantage: that
instead of turning the Canadians and Indians
against us, as is wrongly suggested by many, it
would unavoidably attach and connect them to
our interest." From Newbury, Colonel Bayley,
on the 23d of June, addressed the Northern Indians
as follows: "If you have a mind to join
us, I will go with any number you shall bring to
our army, and you shall each have a good coat
and blanket, etc., and forty shillings per month,
be the time longer or shorter."</p>
<p class="pfc4">In the autumn of 1775, Arnold on his Kennebec
march was joined at Sartigan by a number
of Indians, to whom he offered "one Portuguese
per month, two dollars bounty, their provisions,
and the liberty to choose their own officers."
Under this inducement they took their canoes
and proceeded with the invading column.</p>

Governor Trumbull, of Connecticut, was in
correspondence with Major Brown. Fifteen
days after the fall of Ticonderoga the governor
wrote to the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts
Bay, and, without mentioning his authority,
spoke of the "iterated intelligence we receive
of the plans framed by our enemies to distress
us, by inroads of Canadians and savages from
the Province of Quebec upon the adjacent settlements."
(Stuart's <i>Trumbull</i>, p. 185.) In a
note (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 186) an extract from a letter of
Arnold, of the 19th, is given, in which Arnold
says that there are "400 regulars at St. Johns,
making all possible preparation to cross the lake,
and expecting to be joined by a body of Indians,
with a design of retaking Crown Point
and Ticonderoga." (Cf. also, Arnold, May 23d,
from Crown Point, in <i>Jour. Cong.</i>, i. 111.) The
New Hampshire Provincial Congress, on the 3d
of June, 1775, had "undoubted intelligence of
the attempts of the British ministry to engage
the Canadians and savages in their interest, in
the present controversy with America, and by
actual movements in Canada." (<i>Sparks's MSS.</i>)
On the 6th of July, 1775, Governor Trumbull
wrote to General Schuyler, enclosing a statement
of a person who had been in Canada, containing
the assertion that Governor Carleton
"directly solicited the Indians for their assistance,
but on their refusal declared he would dispossess
them, and give their lands to those who
would." July 21, 1775, Schuyler gave Major
John Brown a general letter for use in Canada,
in which he said: "Reports prevail that General
Carleton intends an excursion into these parts;
that for that purpose he is raising a body of
Canadians and Indians." (Lossing's <i>Schuyler</i>,
i. 366.) On Aug. 15th, Brown reported that "Sir
John Johnson was at Montreal with a body of
about 300 Tories and some Indians, trying to
persuade the Caughnawagas to take up the
hatchet", etc. (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 380). From the foregoing
we can see that Congress had some reason to
believe that the English authorities were at work
among the Indians. Washington was evidently
not convinced of the fact until Schuyler received
information of a positive character concerning
the Guy Johnson conference at Montreal. On
the 24th of December, 1775, he wrote to Schuyler:
"The proofs you have of the ministry's intention
to engage the savages are incontrovertible.
We have other confirmation of it by some
despatches from John Stuart, the superintendent
for the southern district, which luckily fell into
my hands" (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, iii. p. 209).
Congress had not made public its previous
sources of information, but it authorized the
publication of "the second paragraph in General
Schuyler's letter relative to the measures
taken by the ministerial agents to engage the
Indians in a war with the colonies." Montgomery,
at St. John's, had, in September, already
met with proofs of the most convincing character,
but the presence of the Mohawks there, and
their opposition to the American force, does not
seem to have made the impression to which it
was entitled.</p>

<i>Secret Journals of Congress</i>, p. 44. Sparks, in
his review of the subject, says "After the sanguinary
affair at the Cedars ... Congress
openly changed their system" (<i>Washington</i>, iii.
p. 497). The resolution passed May 25th.
Washington was then in Philadelphia. As late
as June 9th, he wrote from New York: "I have
been much surprised at not receiving a more explicit
account of the defeat of Colonel Bedell and
his party at the Cedars. I should have thought
some of the officers in command would and
ought to have transmitted it immediately, but
as they have not, it is probable that I should
have long remained in doubt as to the event,
had not the commissioners called on me to-day."
The coincidence of Washington's presence in
Philadelphia at the time of the passage of the
resolve is more significant than the fact that a
battle had been fought of which the general of
the army had only just heard two weeks after
that date.</p>

The address to the people of Ireland is
dated May 10, 1775, the date of the assembling
of Congress. The address was agreed to July
28th. It would be hard to justify the language
used, if we accept the nominal date of the instrument
as the actual date of its composition.
When it was issued, the atrocities committed at
the Cedars were still fresh in the minds of the
members.</p>

This letter of Dunmore is quoted by Dartmouth.
(<i>Am. Arch.</i>, 4th, iii. 6.) On the 23d of
April, 1779, William Livingston forwarded
copy to Congress. It was ordered to be printed
(Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>, viii. p. 278). According
to Bancroft, Gage in 1774 asked Carleton
his opinion about raising "a body of Canadians
and Indians, and for them to form a junction
with the king's forces in this province." Carleton,
in reply, apparently discouraged the project,
saying, "You know what sort of people they
[the Indians] are" (Bancroft, vii. pp. 117, 119).</p>

Guy Johnson was the son-in-law of Sir William
Johnson, as well as his successor in office,
and the Mohawks said: "The love we have for

whole Six Nations are under to him, must make
us regard and protect every branch of his family."</p>

From the best evidence that I can get, I conclude
that Ontario and Oswego are one. Stone
and Lossing state that there were two conferences.
Guy Johnson, in "a brief sketch of his
past transactions", refers to but one (<i>N. Y. Col.
Doc.</i>, viii. 636).</p>

At a conference between Captain John, in
behalf of the Six Nations, and Colonel Butler,
of the colony of Connecticut, in 1776, Captain
John said: "We come to make you a visit, and
let you know we were at the treaty at Oswego
with Col. Guy Johnson." "We do now assure
you that so long as the waters run, so long you
may depend on our friendship. We are all of
one mind and are all for peace." (Miner's <i>Wyoming</i>,
p. 183.) Under date of Nov. 21, 1774, the
following is entered in the records of Harvard
College: "As the corporation with pleasure
have received information of Mr. Zebulon Butler
to engage in a mission to the Tuscarora Indians,
they cheerfully signify their readiness to
give him all suitable encouragement, as far as
may be in their power, if he should proceed according
to his intention in so laudable an undertaking."
This extract will perhaps explain Col.
Butler's influence among the Indians.</p>

An unsuccessful attempt was made to detach
Cameron, Stuart's deputy, from the king's
service. He was offered a salary and compensation
for losses if he would join the American
cause. "He refused to resign his commission
or accept of any employment in the colony service."
Hearing later that he was to be seized,
he fled to the Cherokee country. This alarmed
the colonists, but they were quieted when they
heard that he had written "that Captain Stewart
had never given him orders to induce the Indians
to fall upon Carolina, but to keep them
firmly attached to his majesty" (Moultrie's <i>Memoirs</i>,
i. p. 76). It appears from Stuart's correspondence
that he received almost simultaneously,
in the first part of October, satisfactory
replies from the Indians and orders from General
Gage to make use of the natives (<i>Amer.
Arch.</i>, 4th ser., iv. p. 317). The Catawbas, a
relatively insignificant tribe, were said to be
friendly to the rebels. The Cherokees were
ready for attack (Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>, Part
iii., 1776, p. 180).</p>

Numerous other conferences and communications
between different persons and bodies
and the several tribes attracted attention this
season. In May, 1775, the Mohawks declared
to the committee of Albany and Schenectady
that it was their intention to remain neutral, but
they had heard that their superintendent was
threatened, and they would protect him (<i>Am.
Arch.</i>, 4th ser., ii. p. 842). They also addressed
a letter to the Oneidas, calling on them to prevent
the Bostonians from capturing him (<i>Ibid.</i>
pp. 664, 665). For accounts of the conferences,
see <i>Am. Arch.</i>, 4th ser., iii.; also Stone's <i>Brant</i>,

When Fort Stanwix was occupied without
causing an Indian outbreak, Washington congratulated
Schuyler (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, iv.
p. 24). We have but little information of the
conference at Montreal which Col. Guy Johnson
held in July; but in Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>, i.
p. 241, the statement is made that a considerable
number of the chiefs and warriors of the Six
Nations were present, and that there were also
present 1,700 Caughnawagas. In the presence
of Governor Carleton, "they unanimously resolved
to support their engagements with his
majesty, and remove all intruders on the several
communications." This gives a hint of the jealousy
with which they regarded the occupation
of the posts at the carrying-places between the
Mohawk Valley and the lakes. See also Guy
Carleton's letter to Dartmouth (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>,
viii. 635), in which he says that at Ontario they
agreed to defend the communications.</p>

An intended conference of the Six Nations
with the Canadian Indians was announced to
Congress by Schuyler in January, 1776 (<i>Am.
Arch.</i>, 4th ser., iv. p. 898). In March the Oneidas,
by their friendly interference, again prevented
the taking up of the hatchet which had
been surrendered at Albany. (Dean to Schuyler,
<i>Am. Arch.</i>, 4th ser., v. p. 768.) The Caughnawagas
went to Oneida, but would not go to
the Onondaga council in March (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 769).
Dean went to the Onondaga council. While
on the way there his life was threatened, and the
Oneidas declined to go on until they received assurances
of Dean's safety (<i>Ibid.</i> pp. 1100-1103).
The Caughnawagas, returning from Onondaga[?],
surrendered the sharp hatchet which Col.
Guy Johnson had given them. ("The Commissioners
in Canada to the President of Congress,
Montreal, May 6, 1776", in <i>Ibid.</i> p. 1214.)</p>

The site is at present covered by the town

for a time the new name conquered a place in

known and spoken of by its original title. There
had been another Fort Schuyler at the spot
where Utica now stands, and this fact has caused
some confusion. See a paper on Forts Stanwix

The "large force at Oswego" was probably
suggested by a grand Indian council held at
Niagara in September, 1776, between Col. John
Butler and others representing the English and
fifteen Indian tribes, including representatives
of the Six Nations. The Indians declared their
intention to embark in the war and abide the
result of the contest (MSS. of Gen. Gansevoort,

The hints as to Burgoyne's opinions of the
Indians which are derived from contemporaneous
documents are of course more satisfactory than
any of his subsequent expressions of opinion.
In his speech in the House of Commons, May
26, 1778, his estimate of their value as soldiers
was very reasonable: "Sir, I ever esteemed the
Indian alliance, at best, a necessary evil. I ever
believed their services to be overvalued; sometimes
insignificant, often barbarous, always capricious;
and that the employment of them in
war was only justifiable when, by being united
to a regular army, they could be kept under
control, and rendered subservient to a general
system." (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>, ix. p. 218).</p>

The number of Herkimer's force can never
be positively ascertained. It has generally been

Morris (<i>Journals of the Provincial Congress, the

Simms says that Stone is in error in making
two engagements, one in 1778 and one in 1779,
at this spot, and he places the date at May 30,
1778. Campbell describes the event as having
occurred in 1779 (<i>Border Warfare</i>, etc., p. 175).
Thacher, in his <i>Military Journal</i>, mentions the
event in 1778. The next date preceding the entry
is May 20th; the next succeeding, June 1st.
Col. Stone actually gives three accounts of this
engagement,&mdash;two in the summer of 1778 and
one in 1779.</p>

The population of the valley at that time
has been estimated by Miner at twenty-five hundred,
who rejects the larger number given by
Chapman and others as not being based on any
enumeration; but John Jenkins, in 1783, represented,
in behalf of the inhabitants, to the legislature,
that such an enumeration was taken, and
yielded six thousand persons.</p>

From Major John Butler's report to Lieut.-Col.
Bolton, dated at Lackwanak, July 8, 1778.
This report was apparently withheld from Miner's
agent, who wrote against its title "Disallowed
at the foreign office." Butler's humanity
"in making those only his object who were
in arms" was the subject of congratulation of
Lord George Germain, in a letter to Sir Henry
Clinton. See extract in Miner's <i>Wyoming</i>, p.
234. Butler probably understates his losses;
but, as is the case with all successful ambuscades,
it must have been light. Miner quotes
from an American prisoner, who thinks from
forty to eighty fell. This seems improbable,
when the circumstances of the fight are taken
into consideration. The report of Colonel Denison
to Governor Trumbull is among the Trumbull
MSS. in the Mass. Hist. Soc.</p>

Eleven dead Indians were left on the field.
The American loss was reported by Sullivan as
three killed and thirty-three wounded. The
number of the enemy engaged was reported by
prisoners at eight hundred, although Butler himself
stated that his whole force numbered only
six hundred men.</p>

Aug. 20, 1779, General Haldimand had a
conference with deputies of the Six Nations.
Sullivan was then invading the Indian country.
Haldimand told the Indians that he did not
"establish" Oswego, because he then "had intelligence
that the rebels were preparing boats
at Saratoga and Albany to go up the Mohawk
River, with an intention to take post at Oswego;
but in the course of a few weeks he received a
different account, that that was not their intention,
but a large rebel army was come up the
Connecticut River under the command of the
rebel General Haysen, with an intention to invade
this province." "As to your apprehensions
of the rebels coming to attack your country,
I cannot have the least thought of it" (<i>N. Y.
Col. Doc.</i>, viii. p. 776). Sullivan's force was accounted
for as "a feint to be made upon the
Susquehanna to draw the attention of Colonel
Butler and the Six Nations of Indians from going
to Detroit."</p>

Respecting the original maps made by
Lieut. Lodge, of Sullivan's army, showing by
actual survey the routes of the several divisions
of the army, General Clark informs me that
they have been discovered, and will be included
in a proposed volume on the campaign, to be issued
by the State of New York. What seems
to be an original map is preserved among the
Force maps in the library of Congress. There
is in Simms's <i>Frontiersmen</i> (ii. 272) a map of
Sullivan's march along Seneca and Cayuga
lakes from the Tioga, following a sketch found
among the papers of Capt. Machin, who was in
the expedition. See note following this chapter.</p>

It did not need that with the adoption of Indian
tactics the barbarous custom of mangling
the dead should be included, even for purposes
of economy. "On Monday, the 30th, sent out a
party for some dead Indians." "Toward morning
found them, and skinned two of them from
their hips down, for boot-legs: one pair for the
major, the other for myself" (<i>Proc. N. J. Hist.
Soc.</i>, ii. p. 31,&mdash;Diary of Lieut. William Barton).</p>

The destruction of grain in Schoharie Valley
alarmed Washington. On November 5th he
wrote Governor Clinton, saying: "We had the
most pleasing prospects of forming considerable
magazines of bread from the country which has
been laid waste, and which from your Excellency's
letter is so extensive that I am apprehensive
we shall be obliged to bring flour from
the South to support the troops at and near
West Point" (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, vii. p. 282).</p>

The operations of the several columns are
reported by Gen. Haldimand in a letter to Lord
George Germain, dated Quebec, Oct. 25, 1780.
The return of "rebels killed and taken on the
expedition to the Mohawk River, in October,
1780", was as follows: On the Mohawk River
and at Stone Arabia, the 18th, 19th, and 20th of
October, prisoners, 10 privates; killed, 1 colonel
and 100 privates. At Canaghsioraga, the 23d
of October, prisoners, 2 captains, 1 lieutenant,
4 sergeants, 4 corporals, 45 privates; killed, 1
lieutenant, 3 privates. The returns of October
23d must refer to the capture of the party sent
to destroy the boats, an event which is generally
said to have been accomplished without
firing a shot.</p>

William Leete Stone was born April 20,
1792. He died August 15, 1844. He was for
many years one of the proprietors and editors of
the <i>New York Commercial Advertiser</i>. In addition
to the works enumerated in the text, and
besides several miscellaneous works, he also
published <i>Border Wars of the American Revolution</i>
(two volumes, 1839), <i>Poetry and History of
Wyoming</i>, (1841), and <i>Life of Uncas and Miantonamoh</i>
(1842). He is generally spoken of as
Col. Stone, a title which he gained through a
staff-office. (Cf. account of Col. S. in <i>Hist.
Mag.</i>, Sept., 1865, and his portrait in Feb., 1866).</p>

In this book there is a full account of the
organization of a company of rangers, and a description
of their mock Indian costume. There
is also an account of the seizure and destruction
by the settlers of a lot of goods which the authorities
had quietly permitted to be forwarded
by traders to the frontier for traffic with the
Indians at a time when the border inhabitants
did not wish it done. The military authorities,
who interfered, were brushed away as lightly as
the traders had been who complained to them.

Lack of space prevents the proper development
of the influence upon the Indians, of the
constant absorption by the colonies of their lands.
Besides settlers with their families; besides
squatters, and in addition to English companies,
like the Ohio Company and the Walpole Company,
the attention of individuals was directed
towards these lands for the double purposes of
colonization and investment. Bancroft (vi. 377)
says that Franklin organized "a powerful company
to plant a province in that part of the country
which lay back of Virginia, between the
Alleghanies and a line drawn from Cumberland
Gap to the mouth of the Scioto." The correspondence
of Washington discloses his eagerness
to secure land for investment (see Vol. V. p.
271). He labored to get for the soldiers who
had participated with him in the French wars the
land bounties offered by Dinwiddie, and in addition
he sought to secure land for himself by
purchase. "Nothing is more certain", he wrote
to his agent, "than that the lands cannot remain
long ungranted, when once it is known that
rights are to be had" (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, ii.
346). "My plan is to secure a good deal of
land" (<i>Ibid.</i> 348). He wished the matter kept
secret, as he apprehended that others would enter
into the same movement if they knew about it
(<i>Ibid.</i> 349). In 1770 he personally visited the
valley of the Ohio, and marked corners for the
soldiers' land. While on this trip he was told by
Indians that they viewed the settlements of the
people on this river with an uneasy and jealous
eye, and that they must be compensated for their
right if the people settle there, notwithstanding
the cession of the Six Nations (<i>Ibid.</i> 531).</p>
<p class="pfc4">In Pennsylvania an act was passed Feb. 18,
1769, "to prevent persons from settling on lands
within the boundaries of this province not purchased
of Indians." The preamble recites that
"Whereas, many disorderly persons have presumed
to settle upon lands not purchased of the
Indians, which has occasioned great uneasiness
and dissatisfaction on the part of the said Indians,
and have [<i>sic</i>] been attended with dangerous
consequences to the peace and safety of the
province", etc. (<i>Laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, etc., republished under authority
of the Legislature</i>, by Alexander James Dallas,
Philadelphia, 1797).</p>

If land companies were disposed to avail
themselves of the doubt as to what tribe of Indians
had a right to sell land, so the British
government itself had treated the question of
their shadowy allegiance to suit its convenience.
Bradstreet, in his abortive attempts at making a
treaty with them, called them subjects. Sir William
Johnson said the very idea of being "subjects
was abhorrent to them." Compare this
with the doctrine laid down in Huske's <i>Present
State of North America</i>, pp. 16, 17.</p>

Croghan's testimony does not materially alter
the boundaries as they were defined by Sir
William Johnson in his report to the Lords of
Trade, Nov. 13, 1763 (<i>N. Y. Col. Docs.</i>, vii. p. 573).
"Along the ridge of the Blue Mountains to the
head of the Kentucky River, and down the same
to the Ohio above the rifts, thence northerly to
the south end of Lake Michigan", etc. Cf. letters
(1767) to Franklin from George Croghan,
Joseph Galloway, and Samuel Wharton, in the
Shelburne Papers (<i>Hist. MSS. Com. Rep.</i>, v. 218).</p>

entitled "The Property Line of 1768", to the

Fort Stanwix treaty came to be known as the
"Property Line", and forcibly points out the
powerful influence this treaty had upon the Revolution.</p>

This original edition is called <i>History of the
Discovery of America, of the landing of our forefathers
at Plymouth, and of their most remarkable
engagements with the Indians in New England
from their first landing in 1620, until the final
subjugation of the natives in 1669</i>. <i>To which is
annexed the defeat of Generals Braddock, Harmer,
and St. Clair by the Indians at the Westward, etc.</i>
By the Rev. James Steward, D. D. (Brooklyn,
L. I., no date). Slight changes were made in
some of the titles to later editions, to indicate
the material added, and the date 1669 was altered
to 1679. Pritts, under the impression that it was
a rare book, reprinted it in his <i>Border Life</i>, etc.
Its accuracy was impugned in the <i>Historical
Magazine</i> (1857, p. 376; and 1858, p. 29). It
was vigorously denounced in Field's <i>Indian Bibliography</i>
(no. 1,570, p. 397). "This work under
all its Protean forms bears evidence that it was
written for a comparatively unlettered public."
Col. Peter Force is quoted as having said that
he found twenty-two chronological errors on a
single page. The notice concludes: "Under all
forms there is only a variation of worthlessness."
Dr. Trumbull gives a brief bibliographical notice
in the <i>Brinley Catalogue</i> (which shows six
editions), from which I have extracted some of
the information used in the text. The very poor
woodcuts with which the book was originally
illustrated, the violent colors with which the
wretched illustrations of some of the later editions
were disfigured, and the errors of dates,
have prevented recognition of what there was of
value about it.</p>

It is not worth while to undertake to follow
this book through all its editions and changes.
It is important, however, for our purposes to
note some of them. The estimate to which I
have alluded is given in the appendix of the
edition referred to above (p. 176), and the statement
is made that it was obtained "from a
gentleman employed in one of the Indian treaties."
There was a second issue of the first
edition with the imprint "Norwich", and the
authorship attributed to "A Citizen of Connecticut."
An edition was published at "Norwich,
for the Author, at his Office", in 1810. In this
edition "Henry Trumbull" appears as the author.
Another edition was issued at Norwich in
1811, and another in 1812. One was also issued
at Trenton in 1812. In these various editions
slight changes in the arrangement of materials
took place, some corrections were made, and
from time to time additional matter was inserted.
The name of the gentleman who furnished the
list of Indians is given on page 115 of the Trenton
edition, which I have been able to consult,
as Benjamin Hawkins. Editions were published
at Boston in 1819, 1828, 1841, and 1846. Dr.
Trumbull is of opinion that there must be
twenty editions of the book, which is certainly
poor enough; but it happens that this list, which
was evidently furnished by some one familiar
with the subject, is to our purpose. The same
list did service in <i>A Tour in the United States of
America</i>, etc., by J. F. D. Smyth (London, 1784),
where it appears (i. p. 347) without recognition
of the original source. The arrangement
of the order of tribes is changed, and the spelling
of many of the Indian names is altered to
correspond with the French methods of spelling,
thus suggesting the possibility that the list
may have been transcribed by Smyth from some
French work. The author foots up the total
number of warriors, including certain tribes west
of the Mississippi and others in Canada, at
58,930. To these he adds one third to represent
the old men, and making an error in his calculation,
calls the total number of men 88,570. Allowing
six souls for each male warrior he arrives
at a total of 531,420, which, he says, "I consider
as the whole number of souls, namely, men, women,
and children of all the Indian nations."</p>

Three of the estimates referred to in the
text are reprinted by Schoolcraft under the following
headings: "Enumeration of M. Chauvignerie's
Official Report to the Government of
Canada, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1736;" "Estimate of Colonel
Bouquet, 1764;" "Estimate of Captain Thomas
Hutchins, 1764." Schoolcraft also gives one
more estimate of that period, viz.: "Account of
the Indian Nations given in the year 1778 by a
Trader who resided many years in the neighborhood
of Detroit. (From the MSS. of James
Madison.)" (Schoolcraft's <i>Indian Tribes</i>, iii. p.
553.)</p>

All of the authorities to which he refers
have already been cited, and it may fairly be
said that there is nothing of special value in his
remarks on the subject. In the development
of the topic to which the work is devoted the
author alludes to the custom of the Indians to
refrain from connection with women not only
during the time that they were on the war-path,
but for some days before starting. The unanimity
of testimony as to this custom of the Indians
renders special citations unnecessary. Until the
natives were debauched in this respect by contact
with civilization, no authentic instance can
be found of the violation of a woman by a
warrior on the war-path. Brantz Mayer, in his
defence of Cresap (<i>Logan and Cresap</i>, p. 110),
quotes from the <i>Md. Gazette</i> (Nov. 30, 1774) a
charge of this sort. If there was foundation for
it in the minds of those who made it, investigation
would probably have traced the outrage to
whites disguised as Indians. The superstition
which protected women from Indian assault was
still in force at that time.</p>

The editor says he "has given the following
memorandum of Indian <i>fighting men</i>, inhabiting
near the distant parts, in 1762; to indulge the
curious in future times, and show also the extent
of Dr. Franklin's travels. He believes it likely
to have been taken by Dr. Franklin in an expedition
which he made as a commander in the
Pennsylvania militia, in order to determine measures
and situation for the outposts; but is by no
means assured of the accuracy of this opinion.
The paper, however, is in Dr. Franklin's handwriting:
but it must not be mistaken as containing
a list of the whole of the natives enumerated,
but only as such part of them as lived near the
places described."</p>

In addition to a vast number of reports, extracts
from letters, and proceedings of one sort
and another, I would call especial attention to
the following papers: Carleton's Commission
(ii. p. 120); Proceedings connected with Connolly's
arrest (ii. pp. 218-221); Schuyler's expedition
to Tryon County (iii. p. 135); Stuart's
letter to Gage, Oct. 3, 1776 (Part iii., 1776,
iv. p. 180); an account of Wyoming massacre
from fugitives (vii. p. 51); Col. Wm. Butler's
report to General Stark of the destruction
of Unadilla, etc. (vii. pp. 253-255); Colonel Van
Schaick's report of the destruction of Onondaga
(viii. p. 272); the Minisink affair (viii.
pp. 275, 276); the letter of the Earl of Dartmouth
to Lord Dunmore (viii. p. 278); attack
On Indians at Ogeechee, April, 1779 (viii. p. 300);
action of the Council at Williamsburgh in Hamilton's
case (viii. p. 337); letters from Sullivan's
headquarters concerning battle at Newtown (ix.
p. 23); Sullivan's proclamation to Oneidas (ix.
p. 25); Brodhead's report of his expedition (ix.
p. 152); Sullivan's report, Teaoga, Sept. 30, 1779
(ix. p. 158); Joint movements in the valleys of
Mohawk, Hudson, and Connecticut (xi. pp. 81-83).
The foregoing sufficiently illustrates the
wealth of historical material collected in the <i>Remembrancer</i>.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1352_1352" id="Footnote_1352_1352"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1352_1352"><span class="label">[1352]</span></a></span>
The <i>Register</i> contains nearly all the papers
submitted to Parliament which bore upon American
affairs, together with other documents which
the publishers from time to time added to the
volumes. The <i>Remembrancer</i> and the <i>Register</i>
together furnish the means of writing a history
of the border warfare of the Revolution which
would be nearly complete. A large mass of documentary
material respecting the relation of General
Haldimand in Quebec with the Indians and
with British officers operating with the Indians
is in the <i>Haldimand Papers</i>, in the British Museum,
of which the Dominion archivist, Douglas
Brymner, is now printing a calendar in his
<i>Annual Reports</i> (Ottawa). The correspondence
of Haldimand and Guy Johnson, 1778-1783,
makes three vols. Many papers on this border
warfare are in the Quebec series of MSS. in the
Public Record Office, and are also noted by
Brymner (<i>Report</i>, 1883, p. 79).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

In the <i>Secret Journals</i>, the Articles of Confederation,
proposed by Franklin on the 21st of
July, 1775, are printed in full. I have had occasion
to refer to them because an offensive and
defensive alliance with the Six Nations is proposed
in them. In the "Advertisement" to the
edition of the <i>Secret Journals</i> which is cited,
the publishers say that these Articles "have
never before been published." In the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> (xlv. p. 572) a "Plan of the
American Confederacy" is given. This plan is
copy of Franklin's proposed Articles of Confederation,
with a preamble addressed to the
Provincial Congress of North Carolina, and was
apparently received from that colony. In connection
with this, see Bancroft (viii. p. 97).
In the <i>Scot's Magazine</i> (Edinburgh, 1775, xxxvii.
p. 665) these Articles were copied from the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i>, with this comment: "The
copy from whence this was printed was addressed
particularly to the Province of North
Carolina; but the same was without doubt submitted
to the consideration of every other Provincial Congress,
as the preamble clearly shows."
The preamble thus referred to reads: "The Provincial
Congress of &mdash;&mdash; are to view the following
Articles as a subject which will be proposed
to the Continental Congress at their next session."
These two magazines publish the Articles
as a mere submission of a plan. When the
proposed Articles of Confederation reached the
<i>Annual Register</i> they became "Articles of Confederation
and Perpetual Union entered into by
the several colonies of New Hampshire, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
in General Congress met at Philadelphia, May
20, 1775" (<i>Annual Register</i>, 1775, p. 253). These
Articles were also published as if they had
been adopted in <i>The History of the British Empire,
etc.</i> By a Society of Gentlemen. (Printed
for Robert Campbell &amp; Co., Philadelphia, 1798,
2 vols.: i. p. 188, note.) They are also given as
Articles of Confederation, etc., entered into, etc.,
May 20, 1775, in <i>An Impartial History of the
War in America</i>, etc., Boston, 1781, Appendix
to vol. i. p. 410.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1354_1354" id="Footnote_1354_1354"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1354_1354"><span class="label">[1354]</span></a></span>
The rumors current in the colonies during
the progress of events express the hopes and
the fears of the colonists, and to a certain extent
also indicate their opinions. We should
naturally expect to find in an American collection
of this sort something to help us in getting
at the views of the colonists on the question of
employing Indians. In fact, there is but little
to be found in the book on this subject, and we
are obliged to turn again to Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>,
where we find numerous rumors recorded,
some of them improbable in their very
nature, but serving to indicate the hopes of the
people; as for instance, in a letter from Pittsfield,
May 18, 1775: "The Mohawks had given
permission to the Stockbridge Indians to join
us, and also had 500 men of their own in readiness
to assist" (i. p. 66). Again, Worcester,
May 10: "We hear that the Senecas, one of the
Six Nations, are determined to support the colonies"
(i. p. 84). [This extract will be found
in the <i>Spy</i> of that date.] June 20, 1775: "The
Indians from Canada, when applied to by Governor
Carleton to distress the settlement, say
they have received no offence from the people,
so will not make war with them" (i. p. 147).
August 3: "The Canadians and Indians cannot
be persuaded by Governor Carleton to join his
forces, but are determined to remain neuter"
(i. p. 169). August 12: "The Indian nations,
for a thousand miles westward, are very staunch
friends to the colonies, there being but one
tribe inclined to join Governor Carleton, of
which, however, there is no danger, as the others
are able to drive that tribe and all the force
Carleton can raise" (i. p. 251). The <i>Boston
Gazette and Country Journal</i> for August 21,
1775, contains the statement that "all apprehensions
of danger from our fellow-subjects in Canada
and the Indians are entirely removed." The
arrival of Swashan, with four other Indians of
the St. Francois tribe, at Cambridge, with the
statement that "they were kindly received and
are now in the service", is printed in the columns
of the same journal. Cf. Drake's <i>Book of
the Indians</i>, iii. ch. xii. p. 156; Moore's <i>Diary
of the Rev.</i>, i. p. 127. The <i>Boston Gazette</i>, etc.
(Dec. 4, 1775) has the following: "Last week
his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief received
some despatches from the Honorable Continental
Congress, by which we have authentic intelligence
that several nations of the Western Indians
have offered to send 3,000 men to join the
American forces whenever wanted." <i>The New
England Chronicle or the Essex Gazette</i>, from
Thursday, July 27, to Thursday, August 3, 1775,
published at Stoughton Hall, Harvard College,
under date of Aug. 3, says: "We can't learn that
a single tribe of savages on this continent have
been persuaded to take up the hatchet against
the colonies, notwithstanding the great pains
made use of by the vile emissaries of a savage
ministry for that purpose."</p>

For instance, John Sullivan and John Langdon
write from Philadelphia, May 22, 1775, that
the Indians tell them Guy Johnson "has really
endeavored to persuade the Indians to enter into
a war with us" (vii. p. 501); Lewa, a well-known
Indian, reports the Canadian Indians friendly to
the Americans, and says he "can raise 500 Indians
to assist at any time" (vii. p. 525); Governor
Trumbull has learned that "the Cognawaga
Indians have had a war-dance, being bro't
to it by Gen. Carleton" (vii. p. 532); Rev. Dr.
Eleazer Wheelock gives Dean's report as to the
good-will of the Canadian Indians (vii. p. 547).</p>

Sparks asserts that Natanis, a Penobscot
chief, was in the interest of Carleton (<i>Washington</i>,
iii. p. 112, note). Judge Henry says he was
one of those who joined Arnold at Sartigan. In
the <i>American Archives</i> (5th ser., i. pp. 836, 837),
James Bowdoin, writing to Washington, says
that the Penobscots said "that when General
Washington sent his army to Canada, five of
their people went with them, and two of them
were wounded and three taken prisoners." The
small number of Indians who accompanied Arnold
cut no figure in the campaign, but the advance
of the column under Montgomery excited
fears in the minds of the English in Canada that
the invaders might use the natives as auxiliaries,
precisely as the Americans feared a similar use
on the English side. In Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>
(ii. p. 108), a letter from Quebec states: "General
Montgomery, who commands the provincial
troops, consisting of two regiments of New York
militia, a body of Continental troops, and some
Indians", etc. On Sept. 16, 1775, General Carleton,
writing from Montreal to Gage, in an account
of the landing of the Americans near St.
John's, says: "Many Indians have gone over to
them, and large numbers of Canadians are with
them at Chamblée" (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, iii.
110, note). The Canadian Indians, instead of
contributing to Montgomery's force, asked for
protection,&mdash;a plea which apparently seemed,
in the excitement of the hour in Canada, to be
a declaration of friendship. "The Caghnawagas
have desired a 100 men from us. I have
complied with their request, and am glad to find
they put so much confidence in us, and are so
much afraid of Mr. Carleton" (letter from Montgomery,
camp before St. John's, Oct. 20, 1775, in
Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>, ii. p. 122). The Mohawks,
on the contrary, acted on the English
side, and some of them were killed by the Americans.</p>

It was from these reports, as well as from
personal interviews, that Washington formed his
opinion as to the temper of the Canadian and
Northern Indians. A few quotations will illustrate
what he had a right to think, <i>e. g.</i> (p. 35)
report of committee, August 3, 1775, appointed
to confer with Lewis, a chief of the Caughnawaga
tribe. "<i>Question.</i> Has the governor of Canada
prevailed on the St. Francois Indians to take up
arms against these colonies? <i>Answer.</i> The governor
sent out Messi'rs St. Luc and Bœpassion
to invite the several tribes of Indians to take up
arms against you.... They answered nobody
had taken up arms against them, and they
would not take arms against anybody to trouble
them, and they chose to rest in peace." Again
(p. 80), the committee appointed to confer with
the St. Francois tribe reported, Aug. 18, 1775:
"<i>Q.</i> If Governor Carleton should know you offered
us your assistance, are you not afraid he
would destroy you? <i>A.</i> We are not afraid of
it; he has threatened us, but if he attacks us we
have arms to defend ourselves." Once more
(p. 81): "<i>Q.</i> Do you know whether any tribes
have taken up arms against us? <i>A.</i> All the
tribes have agreed to afford you assistance, if
wanted." Also (p. 89), Aug. 21st, £10 was appropriated
for the use of five Indians belonging
to the St. Francois tribe, "one being a chief of
said tribe; the other four, having entered into
the Continental army, are to receive eight pounds
of said sum as one month's advance wages for
each of them;" and (p. 148) Oct. 9, speech of
two head sachems of the St. John's tribe. "Penobscot
Falls, September 12, 1775. We have
talked with the Penobscot tribe, and by them we
hear that you are engaged in a war with Great
Britain, and that they are engaged to join you in
opposing your and our enemies. We heartily
join with our brethren in the colony of Massachusetts,
and are resolved to stand together, and
oppose the people of Old England, that are endeavoring
to take your and our lands and liberties
from us."</p>

"A company of minute-men, before the 19th
of April, had been embodied among the Stockbridge
tribe of Indians, and this company repaired
to camp. On the 21st of June two of the
Indians, probably of this company, killed four
of the regulars with their bows and arrows, and
plundered them" (Frothingham's <i>Siege of Boston</i>,
p. 212). A letter of July 9th says: "Yesterday
afternoon some barges were sounding the
river of Cambridge (Charles) near its mouth,
but were soon obliged to row off, by our Indians
(fifty in number), who are encamped near that
place" (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 212, note). On the 25th (June):
"This day the Indians killed more of the British
guard." On the 26th: "Two Indians went
down near Bunker Hill, and killed a sentry"
(<i>Ibid.</i> p. 213). Frothingham's authority is given
as "John Kettel's diary. This commences May
17, and continues to Sept. 31, 1775." Through
the kindness of Mr. Thomas G. Frothingham I
have examined the original diary, which, in addition
to the extracts given, contains several
others showing that our riflemen picked off the
British sentries. <i>The Boston Gazette and Country
Journal</i> (August 7, 1775) contains the following:
"Watertown, August 7. Parties of Rifle
Men, together with some Indians, are constantly
harassing the Enemy's advanced Guards, and
say they have killed several of the Regulars
within a Day or two past." (<i>Ibid.</i> 14th): "We
hear that last Thursday Afternoon a number of
Rifle men killed 2 or 3 of the Regulars as they
were relieving the Centries at Charlestown
lines." The fact that two Indians were wounded
by our own sentries in August is recorded in
Craft's Journal, etc. (Essex Institute Hist. Coll.,
iii. p. 55). As there were no Indians with the
English, this must have been an accidental collision.</p>

Col. Stone speaks of two conferences held
in 1775, one at Ontario and one at Oswego. He
says: "Tha-yen-dan-e-gea had accompanied Guy
Johnson from the Mohawk Valley first westward
to Ontario, thence back to Oswego" (<i>Brant</i>, i.
p. 149). Lossing, upon the evidence at his command,
adopted the same opinion: "Johnson
went from Ontario to Oswego" (<i>Schuyler</i>, i.
p. 355). I have made some effort to discover
the site of Ontario, which apparently was to the
"westward" of Oswego, but have been unable
to find it, and have been forced to the conclusion
that the officers who dated their letters
from Fort Ontario at Oswego, and who spoke
of the post in their correspondence, used the
words Ontario and Oswego indifferently to express
the same place. Guy Johnson dates several
letters at Ontario. Col. Butler, in his correspondence
in connection with the St. Leger
expedition, dates his letters first at Niagara, then
at Ontario. On Guy Johnson's map of the country
[see <i>ante</i>, p. 609] the site is designated as
Fort Ontario, and no other Ontario is put down.
Guy Johnson reported that St. Leger had gone
"on the proposed expedition by way of Ontario"
(<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, viii. p. 714). We know
that he went by Oswego, and except that Col.
Butler writes from Ontario, we have no mention
of Ontario in any of the accounts of this expedition.
Gen. Haldimand, in speaking of the
proposed reëstablishment of the post, calls it
Oswego (<i>Ibid.</i> viii. p. 777). Guy Johnson, in
the same connection, calls it Ontario (<i>Ibid.</i> p.
775) and Fort Ontario (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 780). Rev. Dr.
Wheelock, describing Johnson's movements, said
he had withdrawn with his family by the way of
Oswego (<i>N. H. Provincial Papers</i>, vii. p. 548).</p>
<p class="pfc4">Shortly after Johnson's arrival in Montreal he
wrote a brief account of his transactions to the
Earl of Dartmouth, in which he spoke of the
conference at Ontario, but said nothing of a
second at Oswego (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, viii. p. 636).
This journal, certified by Joseph Chew, Secretary
of Indian Affairs, appears to account for
his motions continuously during this period, and
speaks only of the conference at Ontario. He
arrived at Ontario June 17th, embarked at that
point July 11th for Montreal, and arrived at the
latter place July 17th, with 220 Indians from
Ontario (<i>Ibid.</i> viii. p. 658; Ketchum's <i>Buffalo</i>, i.
p. 243). Mr. Berthold Fernow informs me that
in Guy Johnson's account for expenses in the
Indian Department in 1775 this item occurs:
"July 8, 1775. For cash given privately to the
chiefs and warriors of the 6 Nations during the
treaty at Ontario, £260." No other conference
in that immediate neighborhood is mentioned
in the <i>Johnson MSS</i>. An instance of indifference
in the application of the two names will
be found in Mrs. Grant's <i>Memoirs of an American
Lady</i>. Mr. B. B. Burt, of Oswego, writes
to me that "there was not any Ontario west of
Oswego except the <i>lake</i>", and kindly calls my
attention to several instances in the records
which tend to show the confusion in the use
of these names. Among others he refers to a
letter of Sir William Johnson's, in which he
speaks of Ontario and Oswego, apparently meaning
the same place (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, vii. p. 530).
A similar instance, as I believe, is to be found
in the letter of Capt. Walter N. Butler to Gen.
Clinton, Feb. 18, 1779, quoted in Stone's <i>Brant</i>,
i. p. 384. In this latter case it is not surprising
that the identity of the two places was not suspected
by Col. Stone. At first sight Butler
seems to be speaking of two distinct spots. In
Orasmus H. Marshall's <i>Niagara Frontier, embracing
Sketches of its early history and French
and English local names</i> (1865), Ontario as a
town or site is not mentioned. O'Reilly's <i>Rochester</i>
contains an Indian account of the alliance,
which makes no mention of Ontario (see pp.
388, 389). On the other hand, the Duc de la
Rochefoucault Liancourt's <i>Travels through the
United States of North America, the country of
the Iroquois and Upper Canada, in the years
1795, 1796, and 1797</i>, mentions a place called
Ontario on the Genessee River, but he gives no
other description of it than of the log-cabin
where he spent the night.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Hough, in his <i>Northern Invasion of October,
1780</i>, gives his reason for disputing Stone's
statement that the Oneida settlements were destroyed
by the enemy in the winter of 1779-1780.
The reasons for believing that Hough was correct
are stated elsewhere.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Stone places the invasion of the Schoharie
Valley in October, 1780; but Simms (<i>Frontiersmen</i>,
ii. p. 392 <i>et seq.</i>) makes it clear that there were
two invasions during that year, as indeed
Stone himself (vol. ii. p. 97) seems to allow in
quoting from Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i> (part ii.,
1780).</p>
<p class="pfc4">In his enthusiasm for his hero, Col. Stone
is betrayed into calling Brant the principal war-chief
of the confederacy; but Morgan, in his
<i>League of the Iroquois</i> (p. 103), speaking of the
celebrated Joseph Brant Ta-yen-dä-ná-ga, says
his "abilities as a military leader secured to
him the command of the war parties of the
Mohawks during the Revolution. He was also
but a chief, and held no other office or title in
the nation or in the confederacy." (Ketchum's
<i>Buffalo</i>, i. p. 331). Stone (ii. p. 448) further
says "the Six Nations had adopted from the
whites the popular game of ball or cricket",
but the <i>Jesuit Relations</i>, as well as La Potherie
and Charlevoix, would have put him right in
this respect.</p>

Tryon County was formed in 1772 (Albany
County then embracing all the northern and
western part of the colony), so as to cover all
that part of New York State lying west of a
line running north and south nearly through the
centre of the present Schoharie County. Campbell's
work, by its title, therefore fairly included
the scene of all the border warfare of New
York. Many of the notes in the appendix are
valuable, and they contain sketches of the lives
of Sir William Johnson, Brant, Gen. Clinton,
and Gen. Schuyler; Moses Younglove's account
of his captivity and his charges against the English;
and an account of the Wyoming massacre.
Franklin's successful imitation, the Gerrish letter,
is copied (as genuine in the first edition)
from a local newspaper of the Revolutionary
period. A table of the number of Indians employed
by the English in the Revolutionary War
is given, and an article, by the author, on the
direct agency of the English government in the
employment of Indians in the Revolutionary
War is reprinted. The sketch of Clinton's life
was separately published as <i>Lecture on the Life
and Military Services of General James Clinton,
read before the New York Historical Society, Feb.,
1839</i>.</p>

In the <i>History of the United States for families

Historical writers have been greatly at variance
on this point. John M. Brown (pamphlet
<i>History of Schoharie County</i>, quoted by Simms
and Stone) says the event took place in June
or July, 1776; but Stone (<i>Brant</i>, ii. p. 313), in
giving Brown's account, corrects the date to
July, 1778. In the Gansevoort Papers Stone
found the affair assigned to the close of May,
1778, corresponding with the date in Thacher,
and with the account given in McKendry's journal
of the disaster to "Capt. Partrick" at "Coverskill;"
this was adopted by Simms in his
<i>Frontiersmen</i> (ii. p. 151), and Stone put his
narrative under this date in his <i>Brant</i> (ii. p.
354). Campbell (<i>Border Warfare</i>) places it in
1779, but Stone (<i>Brant</i>, ii. p. 412) says that
Capt. Patrick could not possibly have commanded
the troops, as he was killed in the
attack of the previous year. It seems to me
that Simms clearly establishes that there was
but one attack on Cobleskill.</p>

See Vol. V. p. 616. Fort Stanwix, which is
sometimes spoken of as a log fort, is thus described
by Pouchot: "This fort is a square of
about ninety toises on the outside, and is built
of earth, revetted within and without by great
timbers, in the same fashion as those at Oswego"
(vol. ii. p. 138). We find no mention of
Ontario.</p>

De Peyster seems to have misinterpreted
the language of St. Leger's letter, where St.
Leger states that Lieut. Bird was led to suppose
that Sir John Johnson needed succor, and
in consequence of this false information Bird
went to the rescue, thus leaving the camp without
defenders. On page cxi, De Peyster says:
"The white troops, misled by the false reports
of a cowardly Indian, were recalled to the defence
of the camp." There is no phrase in any
accounts that I have met with in which action
on the part of the troops is predicated on
the information of a "cowardly Indian", except
that contained in St. Leger's account, which De
Peyster himself quotes, p. cxxx, as follows:
"Lieut. Bird, misled by the information of a
cowardly Indian that Sir John was prest had
quitted his post; to march to his assistance."
In spite of his mistake as to which marched
to the other's assistance, on page cxxxiv he
says "When the Indians began to slip out
of the fight, the Royal Greens must have been
hurried to the scene of action, leaving the lines
south of the fort entirely destitute of defenders."</p>

The troops which were intended for St.
Leger are named in the <i>Parl. Reg.</i>, viii. p. 211.
He was to have 675 regulars and Tories, "together
with a sufficient number of Canadians
and Indians." St. Leger was to report to Sir
William Howe at Albany. The numbers of the
force which he took with him, although different
in detail, corresponded as a whole with the
estimate. He was so confident of success that
at Lachine he detached a sergeant, a corporal,
and thirty-two privates to accompany the baggage
of the king's royal regiment by way of
Lake Champlain to Albany. Ten "old men"
were also ordered to be left at Point Clair
(<i>Johnson's Orderly-Book</i>, p. 63). Carleton on
the 26th of June reported as follows: "St.
Leger has begun his movement, taking the
detachment of the 34th regiment [100 men],
the royal regiment of New York increased to
about 300 men, and a company of Canadians
[say 75 men]. He will be joined by the detachment
of the 8th regiment [100 men] and the
Indians of the Six Nations with the Misasages,
as he proceeds. About 100 Hanau chasseurs
have since arrived, and are on their way to join
him" (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>, viii. p. 215). The king's (8th)
regiment, which was to join as the expedition
proceeded, and the Hanau chasseurs, were at
Buck Island July 10th (<i>Johnson's Orderly-Book</i>,
p. 67). The increase of Johnson's regiment is
to be accounted for by the presence of "Jessup's
corps" (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 36, note 17). This force, apparently
numbering 675 men, was increased at Oswego
by Butler's rangers, a company of 70 to
75 men, making the total force of whites nominally
about 750 men. From that number 44 men
had been detached, as above. Forty days' provisions
for 500 men were on the 17th of July
ordered to be made ready to be embarked.
From this order De Peyster and Stone argue
that St. Leger's total effective force of whites
was 500 men. In the same order Lieut. Collerton
was directed "to prepare ammunition
for two 6-pounders and 2 cohorns, and 50 rounds
ball cartridges per man for 500 men", showing
by the same reasoning that there were 500 men
who bore muskets. No entry is made in the
order-book concerning provisions for the Indians
and rangers after leaving Buck Island.
Col. Claus reported "150 Mississaugas and Six
Nation Indians" at that point (Claus to Secretary
Knox, <i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, viii. p. 719), and
said that St. Leger had 250 with him when he
arrived at Oswego (<i>Ibid.</i>). Brant joined the expedition
at this point with 300 more (<i>Ibid.</i>). A
company of rangers raised by Col. Butler participated
in the campaign (Carleton to Germain,
July 9 and Sept. 20, 1777, <i>Parl. Reg.</i>, viii. pp.
220, 224). They apparently joined the expedition
at "Ontario", as Butler calls "Oswego."
The Western Indians and the Senecas had
been summoned by Col. Butler. He reported
that "the number of Indians at Ontario and
the Senecas at 'three rivers' cannot fall much
short of 1,000" (<i>Ibid.</i> 226). The Indians were
stopped at "three rivers" by Col. Claus; but
from those assembled at Oswego and "three
rivers", there were "upwards of 800" who went
forward with the expedition to Fort Stanwix
(Claus to Secretary Knox, <i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, viii.
p. 719). Among these were some Senecas, who
participated in the ambuscade under the leadership
of chiefs of their own tribe, in concurrence
with Sir John Johnson and Col. Butler (<i>Parl.
Reg.</i>, viii. p. 226). It is evident that the rations
for 500 men did not make provision for the Indians
nor for the company of rangers. Making
every allowance for the reduction of the force
by illness, it would seem as if the allowance of
650 whites to St. Leger's effective force must
be within limits. The presence of each separate
command alluded to by Carleton in his
report of what had gone forward, is recognized
at some point in the <i>Orderly-Book</i>. The "upwards
of 800 Indians" mentioned by Claus
makes a total of about 1,450. St. Leger throws
a doubt over the number of Indians present by
saying that all of them participated in the ambuscade.
Both Butler and Claus say there were
400 of them in the fight. The probability is that
some of them were engaged in transporting supplies
across the portage, and that all in camp
were sent forward. Col. Stone gives Brant credit
for devising the ambuscade and leading the Indians.
Butler says not a ward of Brant, but
praises the Senecas. Here again we must resort
to conjecture for explanation. It may be
that Brant was on one side of the road with
his "poor Mohawks", of whose sufferings in the
battle he afterwards spoke, while Butler with
his Senecas was on the other side. St. Leger's
statement that all the Indians went to the front
shows one thing at least,&mdash;that the force with
which he undertook to cut off Willett's 250
men must have been whites. He had men
enough with him while engaged in clearing the
creek and in transporting provisions&mdash;with 80
men at the front, and with Lieut. Bird's command,
decoyed from camp by false intelligence&mdash;to
return to intercept Willett. Cf. <i>Precis of the
Wars in Canada</i> (London, 1826), which states
that St. Leger's corps "consisted of 700 regulars,
with eight pieces of ordnance and about
1,000 Indians."</p>
<p class="pfc4">In all this discussion I have assumed that Sir
John Johnson's orderly-book contained all the
orders with reference to rations. As such orders
were not a necessary part of the record,
it may he doubted whether other orders not
affecting that corps would not be found in St.
Leger's order-book.</p>

Mary Jemison puts the loss of the Senecas
alone above what Claus and Butler reported
the total Indian loss. Claus states the British
loss at three officers, two or three privates, and
thirty-two Indians killed (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, viii.
p. 720). Col. Butler puts the English loss in
the action at four officers killed and two privates
wounded; the Indian loss at thirty-three
killed and twenty-nine wounded (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>, viii.
p. 226). Mary Jemison (p. 116) says: "Previous
to the battle of Fort Stanwix the British sent
for the Indians to come and see them whip the
rebels; and at the same time stated that they
did not wish to have them fight, but wanted to
have them just sit down, smoke their pipes, and
look on. Our Indians went, to a man, but, contrary
to their expectation, instead of smoking
and looking on, they were obliged to fight for
their lives; and in the end were completely
beaten, with a great loss of killed and wounded.
Our Indians alone had thirty-six killed and a
great number wounded. Our town exhibited a
scene of real sorrow and distress when our warriors
returned, recounted their misfortunes, and
stated the real loss they had sustained in the
engagement. The mourning was excessive, and
was expressed by the most doleful yells, shrieks,
and howlings, and by inimitable gesticulations."</p>

The exaggerated rumors of the losses at
Minisink which first reached Sullivan's camp
were immediately displaced by more accurate
accounts. "The accts we rec'd from the Delaware
at Minisings on the 29th are more favorable
than at first represented. The Tories and
savages made a descent upon that settlement,
and, having burned several houses, barns, etc.,
were attacked by a Regt. of Militia, who repulsed
and pursued them a considerable distance.
Forty men were killed on our side, the
Colo. and Major included" (Major Norris's
journal in <i>Publications of the Buffalo Hist. Soc.</i>,
i. p. 225).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The account which appears in the <i>Boston
Gazette and Country Journal</i>, Sept. 6, 1779, is
singularly free from exaggeration. Indeed, it
underrates the whole affair. It speaks of the
destruction of the town as "an excursion on old
Minisink", and says the militia marched to the
assistance of their neighbors and followed the
savages thirty miles into the wilderness. An
action ensued in which upwards of twenty of
the enemy were killed, and our losses, killed,
wounded, and missing, were upwards of thirty.
The later accounts are in E. M. Ruttenber's
<i>Orange County</i> (Newburgh, 1875); Charles E.
Stickney's <i>Minisink Region</i> (Middletown, 1867);
in the <i>N. Y. Columbian</i>, copied in Niles's <i>Principles
and Acts</i>, and in Dr. Arnell's <i>Address to
the Med. Soc. of Orange Co.</i>; and the addresses
at the dedication of the monument at Goshen
(showing forty-five names of the slain), in Samuel
W. Eager's <i>Outline Hist. of Orange County</i>.</p>

Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>, viii. 51. The <i>Boston
Gazette and Country Journal</i> (July 27, 1778)
contains a letter from Samuel Avery, July 15,
1778, giving the "disagreeable intelligence,
brought by Mr. Solomon Avery, this moment
returned from Wyoming, on the Susquehanna
River", which says: "The informant conceives,
that of about five thousand inhabitants one half
are killed and taken by the enemy prisoners, and
the other half fleeing away naked and distressed."

William L. Stone, in the <i>Life and Times of
Red Jacket</i>, referring to his father's <i>Life of
Brant</i>, says (p. 75): "Indeed, until this work
appeared, it was universally believed that
Brant and his Mohawk warriors were engaged in
the massacre of Wyoming. Gordon, Ramsay,
Thacher, and Marshall assert the same thing."
Thacher in his account of Wyoming, under date
of August 3, does not mention Brant's name,
but charges the responsibility for the atrocities
upon Col. John Butler.</p>
<p class="pfc4">
Ramsay (ii. 323, etc.) mentions Brant's name,
but does not charge upon the invaders an indiscriminate
slaughter. He says the women and
children were permitted to cross the Susquehanna
and retreat through the woods to Northampton
County. Stone claimed an <i>alibi</i> for
Brant in his <i>Border Wars</i>, while Caleb Cushing
(<i>Democratic Rev.</i>) thought the case not proved;
but Stone, again, in his <i>Wyoming</i>, reasserted it,
and Peck, in his <i>Wyoming</i> (3d ed., N. Y., 1868),
sustains Stone. The question is also discussed by
Thomas Maxwell in Schoolcraft's <i>Indian Tribes</i>,
v. 672.</p>
<p class="pfc4">On this subject see "Letter to the Mohawk
chief, Ahyonwaegho, commonly called John
Brant, Esq., of the Grand River, Upper Canada,
from Thomas Campbell, Jan. 20, 1822", published
in the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, London,
1822 (vol. iv. p. 97).</p>
<p class="pfc4">It has been already stated that the correspondence
of Guy Johnson shows that in the plan of
campaign Brant's field of operations in 1778 did
not include Wyoming. Gen. John S. Clark in a
private note quotes from a MS. in the handwriting
of Col. Daniel Claus, entitled <i>Anecdotes of
Captain Joseph Brant, 1778</i>, a copy of which is
in the possession of Hon. J. B. Plumb, of Niagara,
Canada, a statement that Sakayenwaraghton
led the Senecas at Oriskany (1777), and
that after the battle a council was held at Canadesege,
at which it was agreed that this chieftain
should attack Wyoming in the early spring,
and that Brant should attack the New York
settlements. This MS. further says that the
Indians "bore the whole brunt of the action, for
there were but two of Butler's rangers killed."
What is known of the life of this Seneca chieftain
is given by Geo. S. Conover in his pamphlet,
<i>Sayengueraghta, King of the Senecas</i> (Waterloo,
1885).</p>

Ryerson in his <i>Loyalists of America</i> (ii. ch.
34) compares the accounts of Wyoming given
by Ramsay, Bancroft, Tucker, and Hildreth, and
credits Hildreth with the most accurate story.
He copies Stone's account from the <i>Life of
Brant</i>, and expresses himself in approbation of
it. There is an account of the Wyoming affair
in <i>The History of Connecticut from the first Settlement
to the present time</i>, by Theodore Dwight,
Jr. (New York, 1841), which is unusually full of
errors. I should be strongly inclined to quote
here from the pages of Murray's <i>Impartial History
of the present War</i>, etc., to show that British
opinions were as strongly pronounced in their
expressions against the reported acts of Butler,
and that they held the authorities who permitted
him to bear a commission responsible, were it
not that I find so many pages in this book identical
with <i>An Impartial History of the War in
America</i>, which was published about the same
time in Boston, that I am at a loss to determine
which was the original book. The two books
are not in all respects the same. The one purports
to be an English composition, the other an
American recital. Phrases in which the enemy
are alluded to in the one are reversed in the
other, while topics which are elaborated in one
are barely mentioned in the other; still, there
are enough pages identical in the two, except for
the toning down of the adjectives, to make me
doubtful of the authorship of the Rev. James
Murray. The bibliography of these books is
examined elsewhere in this <i>History</i>.</p>

In order to show what has been accepted as
history on this point, I quote a portion of the account
in this history, which is typical: "After
the savages had completed their work of slaughter
in the field, they proceeded immediately to invest
Fort Kingston, in which Col. Dennison had been
left with the small remnant of Butler's troops
and the defenceless women and children. In
such a state of weakness the defence of the fort
was out of the question; and all that remained
to Dennison was to attempt to gain some advantageous
terms by the offer of a surrender. For
this purpose he went himself to the savage chief;
but that inhuman monster, that Christian cannibal,
replied to the question of terms that he should
grant them <i>the hatchet</i>. He was more than true
to his word, for when, after resisting until all
his garrison were killed or disabled, Col. Dennison
was compelled to surrender at discretion,
his merciless conqueror, tired of scalping, and
finding the slow process of individual murder
insufficient to glut his appetite, shut up all that
remained in the houses and barracks, and by the
summary aid of fire reduced all at once to one
promiscuous heap of ashes. Nothing now remained
that wore the face of resistance to these
savage invaders but the little fort of Wilksborough,
into which about seventy of Col. Butler's
men had effected their retreat, as has been
said. These, with about the same number of
Continental soldiers, constituted its whole force,
and when their enemy appeared before them
they surrendered without even asking conditions,
under the hope that their voluntary obedience
might find some mercy. But mercy dwelt not
in the bosoms of these American Tories; submission
could not stay their insatiable thirst
of blood. The cruelties and barbarities which
were practised upon these unresisting soldiers
were even more wanton, if possible, than those
which had been exhibited at Fort Kingston.
The seventy Continental soldiers, <i>because</i> they
were <i>Continental</i> soldiers, were deliberately
butchered in cruel succession; and then a repetition
of the same scene of general and promiscuous
conflagration took place, which had closed
the tragedy at the other fort. Men, women, and
children were locked up in the houses, and left
to mingle their cries and screams with the flames
that mocked the power of an avenging God."</p>

Chapman's sketch, although it repeats many
of the errors in the popular accounts, says that
the women and children fled from the valley. It
also gives a copy of the articles of capitulation
at the final surrender (note ii.). This account
is a long step towards the story as at present
accepted.</p>

Bancroft has necessarily treated such events
briefly, but the peculiar facilities which he has
enjoyed for gaining access to the papers in foreign
archives give especial value to his statistics
in connection with such incidents in the war
as the battle of Oriskany and the destruction of
Wyoming.</p>

In the <i>N. E. Hist. and Gen. Register</i> (xiv. p.
265) an article, "Mrs. Skinner and the Massacre
at Wyoming", by D. Williams Patterson,
opens with a quotation from Col. Stone's book,
and then proceeds as follows: "The above account,
which was probably taken by Col. Stone
from a newspaper article, published soon after
the death of Mrs. Skinner, contains so many
errors that it seems proper to place on record a
version of the story more nearly in accordance
with facts." The facts stated are of a biographical
and genealogical character.</p>

In a previous note I have reproduced one of
the typical accounts of the Wyoming massacre, as
the story was told by the earlier historians. The
details given in accounts of that class were accepted
for a long time without question. Fortunately
for the good name of the human race,
Butler, with all his responsibility for the wrongs
done during the continuance of this border warfare,
was not the inhuman wretch which he was
represented to be, and the wholesale slaughter
of the women and children turned out to be a
pure invention. Horrors enough remain unchallenged
to raise a doubt if even now all errors have
been removed. I have not introduced any of
these shocking stories in my narrative, but they
can be found in Chapman, Miner, and Stone.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The story of the horrors of the night is told
in Hubbard's <i>Life of Van Campen</i> in such a
way as to make it seem more probable than the
same story appears when read in some of the
other accounts.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Among the more general accounts are those
in Egle's <i>Pennsylvania</i>; Hollister's <i>Connecticut</i>,
with a good account of the Connecticut colony
in Pennsylvania; H. Hollister's <i>Lackawana Valley</i>
(N. Y., 1857), following Miner closely; Stuart
Pearce's <i>Luzerne County</i> (Philadelphia, 1860);
Campbell's <i>Tryon County</i>, App.; Mrs. E. F.
Ellet's <i>Domestic Hist. of the Amer. Rev.</i> (N. Y.,
1850), ch. 13, and her <i>Women of the Amer. Rev.</i>
(N. Y., 1856), ii. 165; Henry Fergus's <i>United
States</i> in Lardner's <i>Cab. Cyclopædia</i>, reproducing
the old erroneous accounts; and even so late
a history as <i>Cassell's United States</i>, by Edmund
Ollier, is little better. A marked instance of
the heedless method of popular historians is
J. A. Spencer's <i>United States</i> (N. Y., 1858), who
seems to have followed at that late day Thacher
as he found his account in Lossing, <i>Seventeen
Seventy-Six</i> (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, ii. 126-128), which author
reasonably complained that if he were to be
trusted at all, he should have been taken in the
later research of his <i>Field-Book</i>, or even of his
school history, since Dr. Spencer was fond of
quoting such authorities.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Poole's <i>Index</i> gives references to several
periodical articles. Chief among such contributions
are those in the <i>Worcester Mag.</i>, i. 37;
the reviews of Peck in the <i>Methodist Quarterly</i>
(3d ser., xviii. p. 577, and the 4th ser., vol. xl.),
and the paper in <i>Household Words</i>, xviii. p. 282;
A. H. Guernsey in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, xvii. 306 (also
see vii. 613); L. W. Peck in <i>National Mag.</i>, v.
147; Erastus Brooks in the <i>Southern Lit. Messenger</i>,
vii. 553.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The whole subject of the invasion of the valley
was reviewed by Steuben Jenkins in an historical
address, which is embodied in "<i>A record
of the one hundredth year commemorative
observances of the battle and massacre</i>", etc., etc.,
edited by Wesley Johnson (Wilkesbarre, Pa.,
1882).</p>

The story of Cherry Valley is one of the numerous
incidents connected with the border war
included in the <i>Historical Collections of the State
of New York</i>, edited by John W. Barber and
Henry Howe (New York, 1845). Such accounts
in this work are generally transferred bodily
from Campbell or Stone, but occasionally some
old newspaper cutting is reproduced. At the celebration
in 1840, addresses were made by William
W. Campbell and by William H. Seward. They
were published in pamphlet form, and Mr.
Campbell printed his own address as a note to
the 2d edition of the <i>Annals of Tryon County</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The speeches made at centennial anniversary in
1878 were published in the <i>Centennial Celebration
of the State of New York</i> (Albany, 1879). The
main address was delivered by Major Douglass
Campbell (p. 359). Cf. H. C. Goodwin's <i>Cortland
County</i> (N. Y., 1859); Dawson's <i>Battles</i>, i.
ch. 45; Lossing's <i>Field-Book</i>, i. 268, 297.</p>

In a note, vol. iii. p. 312, he says: "Sullivan
in his account says forty: but if a few old houses
which had been deserted for years were met with
and burnt, they were put down for a town. Stables
and wood hovels and lodges in the field,
when the Indians were called to work, these were
all reckoned as houses." He charges that Sullivan
was importunate in absurd demands for
supplies, and amongst other things called for
eggs to take upon his Indian campaign. This
statement of Gordon undoubtedly rests upon
something which he had seen in print. Is it not
probable that his prejudice prevented him from
seeing the humor in a newspaper squib inserted
by some wag, in which Sullivan's slow movements
and pertinacious demands for supplies are
thus ridiculed? Cf. Eben Hazard in <i>Belknap
Papers</i>, i. 23. The writers of "Allen's History"
follow the same lead. "He lived during the
march in every species of extravagance, was constantly
complaining to Congress that he was
not half supplied, and daily amused himself in
unwarrantable remarks to his young officers respecting
the imbecility of Congress and the
board of war" (<i>Allen's Amer. Rev.</i>, ii. 277).
Bancroft (x. 231) speaks of Sullivan as "wasting
his time writing strange theological essays",
and gives him credit for destroying only
"eighteen towns."</p>

The attendant controversies touching Sullivan's
career as a soldier and a legislator are
examined in another place in this <i>History</i>, but
reference may be here made to T. C. Amory's
paper on this expedition in the <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>,
iv. 420, and to another on the same subject in
the <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc.</i>, xx. 88.</p>

Quotations from Haldimand's correspondence
and speeches are given elsewhere. The openness
of Clinton's movements seemed to Washington
such a complete betrayal of the whole
scheme that on the 1st of July he wrote to Sullivan
that Clinton "had transported, and by
last accounts was transporting, provisions and
stores for his whole brigade three months, and
two hundred and twenty or thirty batteaux to
receive them; by which means, in the place of
having his design concealed till the moment of
execution, and forming his junction with you, in
a manner by surprise, it is announced" (Sparks's
<i>Washington</i>, vi. p. 281). During the whole of
this hazardous proceeding Clinton was not molested,
nor did Haldimand seem to derive any
conception of what it meant. Yet Washington
was so far right in saying that the intention of
the movement was "announced" that on the
5th of July the following appeared in the <i>Boston
Gazette and Country Journal</i>: "The stores are
all arrived, and the greatest exertions are made
by Gen. Clinton to transport them unto Lake
Otsego, over a carrying-place of about thirty
miles. Everything will be then ready to go down
the Susquehanna and join Gen. Sullivan."</p>

The latest official figures given by Sullivan
are those of July 21st,&mdash;2,312 rank and file;
the entire number given in the report footing up,
according to Craft, 2,539. In the same estimate,
Craft puts Clinton's force at 1,400, and the total
marching column at 3,100 to 3,200 men. It was
promised by Washington that Lieut.-Col. Pawling
should join Clinton at Anaguaga with 200
men (Sparks's <i>Washington</i>, vi. p. 275). Stone
says Clinton was joined at "Oghkwaga" by a detachment
of Col. Pawling's levies from Wawarsing
(<i>Brant</i>, ii. p. 18). Peabody in his <i>Life of
Sullivan</i> makes the same statement. Bleeker
in his order-book makes no mention of Pawling's
regiment. Erkuries Beatty, August 16th, says:
"Major Church marched to meet the militia
here. Returned in the evening and saw nothing
of them" (<i>Cayuga Co. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i> no. i. p. 64).
McKendry in his journal corroborates this statement
(<i>Sullivan's Expedition against the Indians</i>,
p. 30). In a letter (Aug. 24, 1779) from Gen.
Clinton to his brother, contained in the Sparks
collection, the general states that the expected
reinforcement by Pawling was not effected. <i>Geo.
Clinton papers&mdash;Sparks MSS.</i>, no. xii. (Harvard
Col. library).</p>

Washington in his instructions to Sullivan
had insisted that Sullivan should dispense with
everything possible, on the ground that the delays
incident to the transportation of a great
bulk of stores might balk the expedition (Sparks,
vi. 264; <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, xii., Sept., 1867, p. 139). He
was indignant when he heard that Clinton had
taken to great a quantity of stores with him.
Referring to this, Sullivan wrote to Clinton, July
11, 1779 saying "Gen. Washington has wrote
to me as he has to you, but I have undeceived
him by showing him that in case you depended
on our magazines for stores we must all starve
together, as the commissaries have deceived us in
every article" (Bleeker's <i>Order-book</i>, p. 15). Lt.-Col.
Adam Hubley wrote to the President of
Pennsylvania: "Our expedition is carrying on
rather slow, owing to the delay in provisions, etc.
I sincerely pity Gen. Sullivan's situation. People
who are not acquainted with the reasons of the
delay, I'm informed, censure him, which is absolutely
cruel and unjust" (<i>Penna. Archives</i>, vii.
p. 554). "The long stay at Wyoming was owing
to the infamous conduct of the commissaries
and quartermasters employed in furnishing the
necessary provisions and stores. And finally,
when the army did move, it was so scantily supplied
that the success of the expedition is by that
means rendered exceedingly precarious" (Diary
of Jabez Campfield, surgeon, etc., <i>N. J. Hist.
Soc. Coll.</i>, 2d Series, iii. p. 118). "Various opinions
prevailed about our proceeding any further
on account of our provisions" (Hubley, in Miner's
<i>History</i>, App., p. 97).</p>

Sullivan to Col. John Cook, July 30, 1779:
"Nothing could afford me more pleasure than
to relieve the distressed, or to have it in my
power to add to the safety of your settlement;
but should I comply with your requisition, it
would most effectually answer the intentions of
the enemy, and destroy the grand objects of this
expedition" (<i>Penna. Arch.</i>, vii. p. 593).</p>

"We converted some old tin kettles, found
in the Indian settlements, into large graters, and
obliged every fourth man not on guard to sit
up all night and grate corn, which would make
meal, something like hominy. The meal was
mixed with boiled squash or pumpkin, when hot,
and kneaded into cakes and baked at the fire"

1,500 (<i>Remembrancer</i>, ix. p. 158); Rev.
David Craft, after a study of the subject, estimates
the force at 200 to 250 whites, and probably
not less than 1,000 Indians (<i>Centennial Celebration</i>,
etc., p. 127, note). Cf. <i>Mag. Amer. Hist.</i>,
iv. 420, and F. Barber's letter in <i>Sparks MSS.</i>,

Dr. Campfield says: "The Indian houses
might have been comfortable had they made any
convenience for the smoke to be conveyed out;
only a hole in the middle of the top of the roof
of the house. The Indians are exceedingly
dirty; the rubage of one of their houses is enough
to stink the whole country" (<i>N. J. Hist. Soc.
Proc.</i>, iii., 2d Series, p. 132). Erkuries Beatty,
speaking of the houses at Onoguaga, says that
they were good log houses, with stone chimneys
and glass windows (<i>Cayuga Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, no.
i. p. 64). Van Campen says that the houses were
generally built by fixing large posts in the ground,
at a convenient distance from each other, between
which poles were woven. This formed
the covering of the sides. The roof was made by
laying bark upon poles, which were properly
placed as a support. To afford greater warmth
the sides were plastered with mud. The houses
that were found on the route were all of this description
(John N. Hubbard's <i>Border Adventures
of Major. Moses Van Campen</i>, Bath, N. Y. 1842).
"They were built chiefly with split and hewn
timbers, covered with bark and some other rough
materials, without chimneys or floors" (Norris
in Jones's <i>New York</i>, ii. p. 613). Col. Dearborn
(<i>MS. Journal</i>) uses almost identical language
with Norris. "Newtown&mdash;here are some good
buildings of the English construction" (Capt.
Daniel Livermore, in <i>N. H. Hist. Coll.</i>, vi. pp.
308-335). The huts or wigwams were constructed
of bark, and very narrow in proportion
to their length, some being thirty or forty feet
long, and not more than ten feet wide, generally
with a bark floor, except in the centre,
where there was a place for the fire (Nathan
Davis, in <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, April, 1868, p. 202). According
to Hubley, Chemung contained fifty or
sixty houses built of logs and frames; Catharine's
town, fifty houses, in general very good;
Canadea, about forty well-finished houses, and
everything about it seemed neat and well improved;
Kanadalauga, between twenty and thirty
well-finished houses, chiefly of hewn plank; Anayea,
twelve houses, chiefly of hewn logs (<i>Penna.
Archives</i>, 2d Series, vol. xi.). Nukerck describes
the houses at "Kandaia" as "large and elegant;
some beautifully painted" (Campbell, <i>Annals
Tryon County</i>, p. 155); speaking of "Kanandagua",
he says: "This town, from the appearance
of the buildings, seems to have been inhabited by
white people. Some houses have neat chimneys,
which the Indians have not, but build a fire in the
centre, around which they gather" (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 157).
McKendry speaks of the "cellars and walls" of
the houses at "Onnaguago", and says it was a
"fine settlement, considering they were Indians."
This place had been destroyed fifteen years before
by Capt. Montour, and Sir William Johnson
then described it as having houses "built of
square logs, with good chimneys" (<i>N. Y. Col.
Docs.</i>, vii. p. 628). McKendry says some of the
houses at "Appletown" were of "hew'd timber."
At "Canondesago", some of them built
with hewed timber and part with round timber
and part with bark.</p>

Hildreth and others speak of Niagara as if
it were Sullivan's objective point. John C. Hamilton
(<i>History of the Republic</i>, i. p. 543) says: "Instructions
from Hamilton's pen were addressed
to Sullivan", etc. (p. 544). "A surprise of the
garrison at Niagara and of the shipping on the
lakes was to be attempted." By whom was Niagara
to be surprised? Hamilton leaves it to be
inferred that Sullivan was instructed to attempt
it, whereas it was only mentioned as one of the
possible advantages to be gained from the Indians
in case they should sue for peace.</p>

Ryerson in his <i>Loyalists of America</i>, etc., devotes
a chapter to the Sullivan campaign, which
he terms "Revenge for Wyoming." He confounds
Zebulon Butler with William Butler, which
is not perhaps to be wondered at, for Campbell
and Stone did the same thing, although the
fact that there were two English officers of the
name of Butler engaged in the border wars on the
English side, and two American officers of the
same name opposed to them in the same campaigns,
and the further fact that at Wyoming
the forces on each side were commanded by
a Butler, were warnings enough that especial
scrutiny should be observed in distinguishing
these persons.</p>

General Stryker (p. 7) gives Clinton's force
at 1,700, and Sullivan's at 3,500. He states that
his account was compiled from twenty published
(by typographical error, the compositor has put
thirty) and five unpublished diaries. He suggests
that Sullivan's delay may possibly have
been a part of Washington's strategy. T. C.
Amory shares this opinion.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Sullivan's fight at Newtown is thus described
by H. C. Goodwin in <i>Pioneer History of Cortland
Co.</i>, etc.: "The contest was one which has
but few parallels. The enemy yielded inch by
inch, and when finally forced at the point of the
bayonet to leave their intrenchments and flee,
terror-stricken, to the mountain gorges or almost
impassable <i>lagoons</i>, the ground they had occupied
was found literally drenched with the blood
of the fallen victims." Accounts of varying
length are given in other local histories: <i>Delaware
County and Border Wars of New York</i>,
etc., by Jay Gould (Roxbury, 1856); <i>Centennial
History of Erie County, New York</i>, by Crisfield
Johnson (Buffalo, 1876); <i>Annals of Binghamton
and of the Country connected with it, from

The New Jersey Historical Society has a
MS. order-book kept by Lieutenant-Colonel Barber,
of the Third New Jersey Regiment, who
was also appointed deputy adjutant-general for
the Western army. The last entry made is dated
Sept. 6, 1779. In Hammersly, and in the roster
compiled by General Stryker, Francis Barber is
put down as lieutenant-colonel of this regiment.
This order-book has been attributed by some
to George C. Barber. The library of Cornell
University owns one kept by Thomas Gee, quartermaster's
sergeant in Col. John Lamb's regiment
of artillery, which contains the orders of
the day issued at Fort Sullivan from Aug. 27,
1779, to Oct. 2, 1779 also the return march to
Easton, the last entry being Oct. 26, 1779. My
knowledge of these MS. order-books was derived
from Gen. John S. Clark, of Auburn, N. Y. I
am indebted to Hon. Steuben Jenkins for details
concerning the Barber order-book, and to Professor
Moses Coit Tyler, of Cornell University,
for a description of the Gee order-book. Dr.
F. B. Hough edited the <i>Order-book of Capt. Leonard
Bleeker, major of brigade in the early part
of the expedition under Gen. James Clinton against
the Indians in the Campaign of 1779</i> (N. Y.,
1865). On Clinton's share in the expedition, see
W. W. Campbell's <i>Services of James Clinton</i>

Memoirs</i> (1806). For a portrait of Clinton, see

The expedition is referred to by Gordon,
Ramsay, and Marshall, each of these writers
giving a brief account of the march and the
work accomplished. On the 27th of October,
1779, Congress resolved that "the thanks of
Congress be given to his excellency General
Washington for directing, and to Colonel Brodhead
and the brave officers and soldiers under
his command for executing, the important expedition
against the Mingo and Munsey Indians,
and that part of the Senecas on the Allegheny

of the King of Great Britain, upon the defenceless
inhabitants of the Western frontiers

A descriptive article entitled "Mohawk Valley
in the Revolution", by Harold Frederic, was
published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> (lv. p. 171). Cf.
<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, Oct., 1879. The activity of
the Tories and Indians in the Mohawk Valley
gave rise from time to time to various rumors,
some of which found their way into print. It
was stated in 1779 that Fort Stanwix had surrendered
to the English. This was repeated in
a pamphlet of the day, a mere chronological
register of events, published in 1783, and entitled
<i>The American and British Chronicle of War
and Politics; being an accurate and comprehensive
Register of the most memorable occurrences
in the last ten years of his Majesty's reign, etc.
From May 10, 1773, to July 16, 1783</i>. The entry
of Nov. 2, 1779, was, "Col. Butler, with some
Indians, surprise and take Fort Stanwix, Mohawk
River." In 1780 this rumor was repeated,
and found its way into the <i>Remembrancer</i> (x.
347): "New York, Sept. 23.... We are informed
that about a fortnight ago Fort Stanwix,
after having been five or six weeks closely invested,
was taken by 600 British troops commanded
by a Lieutenant-Colonel, supposed to
be the King's or 8th Regiment: Our faithful
friend, Capt. Joseph Brant, with a party of Indians,
shared in the glory of the conquest."</p>
<p class="pfc4">Occasionally we meet, in the accounts of the
fighting in the Mohawk Valley and vicinity, with
the statement that some Indian was present who
was commissioned by the Continental Congress.
In the <i>Journals of Congress</i> (v. 133) we find that
on the 3d of April, 1779, the board of war submitted
a report, whereupon it was resolved,
"That twelve blank commissions be transmitted
to the commissioners of Indian affairs for the
Northern Department, and that they or any two
of them be empowered to fill them up with the
names of faithful chiefs of the Oneidas and Tuscaroras,
giving them such rank as said commissioners
shall judge they merit." (Cf. <i>Remembrancer</i>,
viii. p. 121)</p>

Stone relied upon the statement of John T.
Kirkland (<i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</i>, iv. p. 69): "In

As early as 1774 the minds of the colonists were turned
inquiringly towards this question. Joseph Reed wrote on
Sept. 25, 1774, to the Earl of Dartmouth, that "the idea
of bringing down the Canadians and savages upon the English
colonies is so inconsistent, not only with mercy, but
justice and humanity of the mother country, that I cannot
allow myself to think that your lordship would promote the
Quebec Bill, or give it your suffrage, with such intention"
(Reed's <i>Reed</i>, i. p. 79). The "full power to levy, arm, muster,
command, and employ all persons whatsoever residing
within our said province", and to "transport such force to
any of our plantations in America", with which Carleton
was commissioned, was but a renewal of the authority
conferred upon James Murray in 1763 (<i>Parl. Reg.</i>, iv.,
App., "The New Commission of the Governor of Quebec",
etc., pp. 8, 26). The same language was used in
the commission of Sir Danvers Osborn, Bart., to be captain-general
of New York in 1754 (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 48). In the
XV. section of the charter granted by Charles II. to the
Lords Proprietors of South Carolina, the grantees were
authorized to levy, muster, and train "all sorts of men, of
what condition, or wheresoever born", and to pursue enemies,
"yea, even without the limits of the said province"
(<i>Ibid.</i> p. 64). The clause is repeated in the second charter
of Charles II. to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina
(<i>Ibid.</i> p. 79). Lord Baltimore was authorized by Charles I.
with the same general powers to levy and arm, and "to
make war and pursue the enemies and robbers aforesaid,
as well by sea as by land, yea, even without the limits of
the said province, and (by God's assistance) to vanquish
and take them." (Cf. <i>The Federal and State Constitutions,
Colonial Charters</i>, etc., Washington, 1877, part ii. p.
1388, "Charter of Carolina, 1663, § 15.")</p>

Samuel Kirkland was born at Norwich, Conn., Dec. 1,
1744; graduated at Princeton, 1765; became a missionary
among the Indians. The hostility of Guy Johnson bore
testimony to the influence of the missionary among the
natives. Kirkland was afterward a chaplain in the army.
In 1789 he received a grant of land two miles square, now
the town of Kirkland, N. Y. He died in 1808. His life,
by S. K. Lothrop, was published in Sparks's <i>American
Biography</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">James Deane was born at Groton, Conn., Aug. 20, 1748;
graduated at Dartmouth in 1773; and then went as missionary
among the Indians. He was employed to pacificate
the Northern Indians, and acted as interpreter on
many important occasions. He was afterward a judge in
Oneida County, N. Y., where he died in 1823. He was
much esteemed. Gov. Trumbull said: "The abilities and
influence of Mr. Deane to attach the Six Nations to the
interest of these colonies is an instance of Divine favor."</p>

The Duc de Choiseul, in conducting the negotiations
on the part of France, suggested that
the English colonies would not fail to shake off
their dependence the moment Canada should
be ceded (Parkman's <i>Montcalm</i>, ii. 403); and
Kalm, the Swedish botanist, who visited America
in 1748-49, made a similar prediction in his
<i>Travels</i>: "The English government has, therefore,
the sufficient reason to consider the French
in North America as the best means of keeping
the colonies in their due submission" (London,
1772, i. 207). As to the spurious Montcalm letters,

A satirical article on restoring Canada to the
French appeared in <i>Gentleman's Mag.</i>, 1759, p.
620, which has the flavor of Dr. Franklin's style:
"Canada ought to be restored in order that
England may have another war; that the French
and Indians may keep on scalping the colonists,
and thereby stint their growth; for otherwise
the children will be as tall as their mother; that,
though we ought to keep faith with our allies,
it is not necessary with our children. We must
teach them, according to Scripture, not to 'put
trust in princes.' Let 'em learn to trust in God.
If we should not restore Canada, it would look
as if our statesmen had courage like our soldiers.
What have statesmen to do with courage?
Their proper character is wisdom." Franklin's
serious and avowed tract is considered in Vol. V.
p. 615.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

"Many reasons may be assigned for this
apparent omission. A consideration for the Indians
was, we presume, the principal, because it
might have given a sensible alarm to that people
if they had seen us formally cantoning out

the very able and interesting political articles in

Sir William Johnson, the superintendent of
Indian affairs, writing to Secretary Conway,
June 28, 1766, said: "Our people in general are
very ill calculated to maintain friendship with
the Indians, they despise in peace those whom
they fear to meet in war. This, with the little
artifices used in trade, and the total want of that
address and seeming kindness practiced with
such success by the French, must always hurt
the colonists. On the contrary, could they but
assume a friendship, and treat them with civility
and candor, we should soon possess their hearts,
and much more of their country than we shall
do in a century by the conduct now practiced"
(<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, vii. 836). The outrageous conduct
of the English traders towards the Indians
is a constant theme of complaint by Sir William
Johnson in his letters to the Lords of Trade (see
<i>Idem</i>, vii. 929, 955, 960, 964, 987). He speaks
(vii. 965) of the contrast between the French
and English traders. The former are gentlemen
in character, manners, and dress; the latter,
"for the most part, men of no zeal or capacity;
men who often sacrifice the credit of the
nation to the basest purposes. Can it otherwise
happen but that the Indians' prejudices must
daily increase, when they are on the one side
seduced by men of abilities, influence, and address;
and on the other, see such low specimens
of British abilities, honor, and honesty? What,
then, can be expected but loss of trade, robbery,
murder of traders, and frequent general ruptures?"

Sir William Johnson, writing Dec. 26, 1764,
to the Lords of Trade, said: "Indeed, it is not
to be wondered that they should be concerned
at our occupying that country, when we consider
that the French (be their motive what it will)
loaded them with favors, and continue to do so,
accompanied with all outward marks of esteem,
and an address peculiarly adapted to their manners,
which infallibly gains upon all Indians who
judge by externals only; and in all their acquaintance
with us [the English] upon the frontiers,
have never found anything like it; but, on
the contrary, harsh treatment, angry words, and,
in short, everything which can be thought of to
inspire them with a dislike for our manners and
jealousy of our views. I have seen so much of
these matters, and am so well convinced of the
utter aversion our people have for them in general,
and of the imprudence with which they
constantly express it, that I absolutely despair
of ever seeing tranquillity established until I may
have proper persons to reside at the posts, whose
business it shall be to remove their prejudices,
and whose interests it becomes to obtain their
esteem and friendship" (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, vii. 689).</p>

that if the English had used common sagacity
in their treatment of Pontiac, the colonies would
have been spared the horrors of the Pontiac
War.</p>

The fort at Detroit was a stockade on the
west side of the Detroit River, twenty-five feet
high, with a bastion at each corner, and a block-house
over each gateway, the whole enclosing
about a hundred small houses. A few pieces of
light artillery were mounted on the bastions.
The garrison consisted of eight officers, one
hundred and twenty soldiers, and forty-five fur
traders, under the command of Major Henry
Gladwin, an experienced and gallant officer.
Two small armed schooners were anchored in
the stream. The white cottages of the Canadian
farmers lined both banks of the river.
About a mile below the fort, on the western
bank, was a village of the Pottawattamies, and
on the opposite shore a Wyandot village. Four
miles above the fort were the lodges of the
Ottawas (Parkman's <i>Pontiac</i>, i. 212-222). Parkman's,
<i>Conspiracy of Pontiac</i> is one of the most
entertaining monographs in American history;
and no writer can treat the subject without
acknowledging his indebtedness to the accurate
and scholarly investigations of that distinguished
historian. The reader of this brief
summary of events will find full details in the
charming narrative of Parkman. He says of
the Bouquet and Haldimand Papers, in the
British Museum, that they contain "several
hundred letters from officers engaged in the
Pontiac War, some official, others personal and
familiar." These he availed himself of in his
last revision (1870), but he had collected 3,400
MS. pages of unprinted documents for his original
edition (1851). All these MS. collections
are now in the library of the Mass. Hist. Society.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

A biographical notice of Major Gladwin
(who became major-general in 1782) by Dr.
O'Callaghan is in <i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, vii. 961.
Parkman spells the name "Gladwyn." Detroit
was now the chief post of this new Northwestern
government. Amherst, in a letter to
Egremont, Nov. 30, 1762, had recommended
the place as the proper headquarters (Shelburne
Papers, vol. 48, <i>Hist. MSS. Com. Report</i>,
v. 217).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Some years later, an Indian who was present
described the scene to Sir William Johnson.
A party of Senecas gained admission to the fort
by treachery, and murdered all the garrison except
the commander, and him they later put to
death by roasting over a slow fire (Parkman,
ii. 20).</p>

A biographical sketch (in French) of Col.
Bouquet, by C. G. F. Dumas, is prefixed to the
Amsterdam edition, 1769, of Bouquet's second
expedition, 1764. The same (in English) is prefixed
to Robert Clarke's reprint in the <i>Ohio Valley
Series</i>, 1868. A different and fuller translation
of Dumas's sketch is in <i>Olden Time</i>, i. 203,
and is preceded (p. 200) by a sketch by another
writer. George H. Fisher, in <i>Penna. Mag.</i>, iii.
121-143, gives the life, with an excellent portrait,
of Col. Bouquet, and his letters to Anne
Willing, a young lady with whom he had tender
relations, but whom he did not marry. J. T. Headley,
in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, xxiii. 577 (Oct., 1861), has
an illustrated article on Col. Bouquet. The
Bouquet Papers, 1757-1765, were given by the
heirs of Gen. Haldimand, in 1857, to the British
Museum. There is a synopsis of them in
Brymner's <i>Report on the Canadian Archives</i>,

He soon found that even they had the bad
habit of losing themselves in the woods. He
wrote to Amherst, July 26th: "I cannot send a
Highlander out of my sight without running the
risk of losing the man, which exposes me to surprise
from the skulking villains I have to deal
with" (Parkman, ii. 56).</p>

The reports of Colonel Bouquet to General
Amherst, Aug. 5th, 6th, and 11th, give the losses
in both actions as 50 killed, 60 wounded, and 5
missing (<i>Gent. Mag.</i>, 1763, p. 486; <i>Lond. Mag.</i>,
1763, p. 545; <i>Mag. of Western Hist.</i>, ii. 650; <i>Annual
Register</i>, 1763, p. 31). Parkman (ii. 68)
makes the losses "8 officers <i>and</i> 115 men." The
officers were included in the above enumeration.
Of the losses by the Indians, General Amherst
wrote (<i>Gent. Mag.</i>, 1763, p. 489): "The number
of the savages slain was about 60, and a great
many wounded in the pursuit. The principal
ringleaders who had the greatest share in fomenting
the present troubles were killed." As
to the number of Indians engaged, Sir William
Johnson (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, vii. 962) states on the
best authorities of white men who were with the
Indians, and of several different Indians, who all
agree, that the true number of Indians who attacked
Colonel Bouquet at Bushy Run was only
ninety-five. This statement seems hardly probable,
in view of the number killed and the accounts
given by the officers engaged.</p>

"His Majesty has been graciously pleased
to signify to the commander-in-chief his royal
approbation of the conduct and bravery of Col.
Bouquet and the officers and troops under his
command in the actions of the 5th and 6th of
August" (General Orders from headquarters in
New York, January 5, 1764).</p>
<p class="pfc4">An excellent description of Bouquet's expedition
of 1763 and of the battle of Bushy Run is in
<i>Annual Register</i>, 1763, pp. 27-32. It was doubtless
written by Edmund Burke from authentic
information furnished by some of the officers engaged.
Another account is in the introduction
to Bouquet's second expedition of 1764, in which
the writer (Dr. William Smith) uses freely the
account in the <i>Annual Register</i>. Cf. T. J. Chapman
on the siege of Fort Pitt in <i>Mag. of Western
Hist.</i>, Feb., 1886.</p>

1763, p. 543; <i>Mag. of West. Hist.</i>, ii. 648. He concludes
his detailed "Return of killed and wounded"
with "Total, 19 killed and 42 wounded."
The name of Captain Dalzell, whom he had
previously reported as killed, is not included
in the return, and the wounded named number
only 39. The <i>Annual Register</i> gives the loss
as "only seventy men killed, and about forty
wounded"!</p>

Bradstreet sent Capt. Thomas Morris on a
mission to Pontiac, and an account of Morris's
experience and his capture by the Indians is
given in his <i>Miscellanies in prose and verse</i> (London,
1791). See Field, <i>Ind. Bibliog.</i>, no. 1,095,
and Thomson's <i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>, no. 854. Morris's
original journal, sent to Bradstreet, is in the
Public Record Office, London. He extended
the copy from which he printed. A letter from
Morris to Bradstreet is among the papers of Sir
William Johnson in the State Library at Albany
(Parkman, ii. 195). The Parkman MSS. (Mass.
Hist. Soc.) have minutes of the council held by
Bradstreet with the Indians at Detroit, Sept. 7,
1764, and the Shelburne Papers (vol. 50) show
similar records (<i>Hist. MSS. Com. Rept.</i>, v. 218).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Sir William Johnson (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, vii.
686), writing to the Lords of Trade, Dec. 26,
1764, and having spoken with much severity of
Bradstreet's bad management of his expedition,
says: "On the other hand, Col. Bouquet, under
all the disadvantages of a tedious and hazardous
land march with an army little more than half
that of the other, has penetrated into the heart
of the country of the Delawares and Shawanese,
obtained above two hundred English captives
from amongst them, with fourteen hostages for
their coming here [Johnson Hall] and entering
into a peace before me in due form; and I daily
expect their chiefs for that purpose." A touching
account of the English captives, the reluctance
of some of them to part from their captors
and savage life, and the joy of others again to
meet their relatives, is in Dr. Smith's <i>Historical
Account</i>, pp. 75-80 (ed. 1868), and in Parkman,
ii. 231-240. An engraving, after Benj. West,
representing the delivery of the English captives
at the forks of the Muskingum, is in some of
the editions (p. 72) of the <i>Historical Account</i>, described

<i>An Historical Account of the Expedition

the command of Henry Bouquet, Esq., Colonel
of Foot, and now Brigadier-General</i>, appeared
from the press of William Bradford, Philadelphia,
in 1765 (Wallace's <i>William Bradford</i>, p.
85). The authorship has been ascribed by Rich,
Allibone, and others to Thomas Hutchins, later
geographer of the United States; but it is now
known that the writer was Dr. William Smith,
Provost of the College of Philadelphia. It is a
quarto, pp. xiii+71, with three maps by Thomas
Hutchins, Asst. Engineer, viz.: (1) "Map [of
the route of Col. Bouquet's expedition of 1763,
and] of the country on the Ohio and Muskingham
Rivers; also, on the same sheet, separated by a
line, a map of the country traversed in his expedition
of 1764;" (2) plan of the Battle of Bushy
Run; and (3) the order of march. The work
has been several times reprinted: (I.) In London,
1766, 4<sup>o</sup>, pp. xiii+71, with the plates named reëngraved,
and two additional plates inserted,
after designs by Benj. West, viz.: (4) conference
of Indians with Col. Bouquet, engraved by
Gregnion; and (5) Indians delivering up the
English captives to Col. Bouquet, engraved by
Canot (II.) At Amsterdam, 1769, 8<sup>o</sup>, pp. xvi+147+ix,
a French translation, with the same
plates very neatly reëngraved, the two maps on
the first plate being engraved separately, making
in all six plates. (III.) At Dublin, 1769, by John
Millikin, pp. xx+99, no plates. (IV.) In <i>Olden
Time</i>, i. 203-221, 241-261, no plates. (V.) In the
<i>Ohio Valley Series</i>, Cincinnati, 1868, with preface
by Francis Parkman, and photo-lithographic
copies of the plates in the London edition. The
last two editions have translations (not the same,
however) of C. G. F. Dumas's biographical
sketch of Col. Bouquet, which is prefixed to the
Amsterdam edition. The first two maps are
prefixed to Hildreth's <i>Western Pioneer</i>, and extracts
from the work are given (pp. 46-64). The
map of the expedition of 1763 is in Parkman's
<i>Pontiac</i> (ii. 199). (Cf. Thomson's <i>Bibliog. of
Ohio</i>, nos. 1,065, etc.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">The <i>Historical Account</i> has an introduction
giving a summary of Col. Bouquet's expedition
of 1763, and supplementary matter, viz., Reflections
on the War with the Savages in North
America; and five appendixes: (I.) Construction
of Forts in America; (II.) Account of the
French Forts ceded to Great Britain in Louisiana;
(III.) Route from Philadelphia to Fort
Pitt; (IV.) Indian Towns on and near the Ohio
River; (V.) Names of Indian tribes in North
America. The supplementary matter, and doubtless
some of the narrative, were furnished by
Col. Bouquet himself, as Dr. Smith, in writing

Gage's despatch, May 27, 1764 (<i>Haldimand
Coll.</i>, p. 18). Major Loftus arrived at New Orleans
from Mobile with the 22d regiment, Feb.
12, 1764. The French governor "gave him a very
bad account of the disposition of the Indians towards
us [the English], and assured him, unless
he carried some presents to distribute amongst
them, that he would not be able to get up the
river" (Gage to Earl Halifax, <i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>,
vii. 619). The attack on the command of Major
Loftus was made on the 20th of March, 1764, by
the Tunicas Indians, a few miles above the mouth
of the Red River: first from the west bank, and
later from the east bank, of the Mississippi.
The spot is indicated on Lieut. Ross's <i>Map of
the Mississippi</i>, 1765 (pub. 1775), by the legend
"Where the 22d regiment was drove back by
the Tunicas, 1764;" and on Andrew Ellicott's
<i>Map of the Mississippi</i>, 1814 (<i>Journal</i>, p. 25), by
"Loftus's Heights", on the east bank. Pittman

Capt. Pittman was the author of <i>The Present
State of the European Settlements on the Mississippi,
with a Geographical Description of that
River; illustrated by [eight] plans and draughts</i>
(London, 1770, 4to). It is the earliest English
account of those settlements, and, as an authority
in early Western history, is of the highest
importance. He was a military engineer, and
for five years was employed in surveying the
Mississippi River and exploring the Western
country. The excellent plans which accompany
the work, artistically engraved on copper, add
greatly to its value. They are: (1) Plan of New
Orleans; (2) Plan of Mobile; (3) Draught of
River Ibbeville to Lake Ponchartrain; (4) Plan
of Fort Rosalia; (5) Plan of Cascaskies [Kaskaskia];

Sir William Johnson, hearing of the failure
of the English troops to reach the Illinois
country by way of the Mississippi, attributed the
result to a conspiracy existing between eighteen
tribes of Indians to prevent it, which he charged
to the intrigue of the French residing in New
Orleans and the Illinois (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, vii.
776).</p>

Fraser, "being too zealous", as Sir William
Johnson wrote in July, 1765, "set out before Mr.
Croghan had effected the necessary points with
the Indians;" and "with two or three attendants"
(Stone's <i>Life of Johnson</i>, ii. 247) floated
down the Ohio, and arrived at Fort Chartres without
casualty. Here he was courteously received
by the French commander; but he and his attendants
were ill treated by drunken Indians,
and their lives were saved by the interposition of
Pontiac in their behalf. The story of Fraser's
troubles came to Sir William in another form,
and he wrote: "From late accounts from Detroit
there is reason to think that Fraser has
been put to death, together with those that accompanied
him, by Pontiac's party" (<i>N. Y.
Col. Doc.</i>, vii. 746). Fraser, finding the Illinois
country at that time an unsafe place of residence,
took a passage in disguise down the Mississippi
to New Orleans, and thence to Mobile.</p>

their treaty of May 8, agreed "to send with Mr.
Croghan proper persons to accompany and assist

George Croghan's journals (for there are
several) of his journey to the Illinois country in
1765 are important documents in the history of
the West. "This journal", says Parkman (ii.
296), "has been twice published,&mdash;in the appendix
to Butler's <i>History of Kentucky</i>, and in the
<i>Pioneer History</i> of Dr. S. P. Hildreth",&mdash;implying
that they were publications of the same
journal. Dr. Hildreth, in a note appended to his
version (p. 85), makes a statement from which it
is evident that he supposed they were the same
journal: "The above journal was copied from
an original MS. among Col. [George] Morgan's
papers, and not copied from Butler's
<i>History of Kentucky</i>, which had not been seen
by the writer at that time." It is an important
fact that these journals are not the same, no
paragraph in one being the same as a paragraph
in the other. Their subject matter is different,
and yet they are in no instance contradictory.
The one printed by Dr. Hildreth may be regarded
as an official report, and the one printed
by Butler as a descriptive account. The former
gives the details of the official business which
he was sent to transact; the latter is such a journal
as any traveller would keep, giving from day
to day the incidents of the journey, describing
the scenery and topography of the country, the
fertility of the soil, the game, and omitting
wholly to speak of public business, or what was
done at councils with the Indians. He describes
his being wounded and captured by the Indians,
near the Wabash, as a personal misfortune, but
makes no mention of conferences with the Indians
at Ouatanon, or of his meeting Pontiac
and making peace with him. Butler (p. 365, ed.
1834; p. 459, ed. 1836) states that "the following
journal, so curious and little known, is extracted
from the <i>Monthly American Journal of
Geology and Natural Science</i>, December, 1831,
by G. W. Featherstonhaugh, Esq., Philadelphia,
and purports to be from the original, in
possession of the editor." This text was reprinted
at Burlington, New Jersey, 1875, in a
tract of 38 pages (Thomson's <i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>,
no. 285). A third version of Croghan's journal
is in the letters of Sir William Johnson to the
Lords of Trade (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, vii. 779-788).
With some variations it is the same as that
printed by Dr. Hildreth. Each contains passages
and paragraphs which are not in the other.
In the Johnson text, words and passages are
omitted, as illegible, which are given in the <i>Pioneer
History</i>. Sir William, writing Nov. 16,
1765, says: "A few days ago [Oct. 21] Mr.
Croghan arrived here, and delivered me his journal
and transactions with the Indians, from
which I have selected the principal parts, which
I now inclose to your lordships. The whole of
his journal is long and not yet collected; because
after he was made prisoner and lost his
baggage, etc., he was necessitated to write it on
scraps of paper procured with difficulty at Post
Vincent [Vincennes], and that in a disguised
character, to prevent its being understood by the
French, in case through any disaster he might
again be plundered" (<i>Ibid.</i> 775). Sir William,
from May 8 to Sept. 28, 1765, frequently reports
that he has heard from Croghan, and mentions
incidents and details which are not contained in
either of the three versions named (<i>Ibid.</i> 746,
749, 765). Being at Post Ouatanon on the 12th
of July, Croghan said: "I wrote to Gen. Gage
and Sir William Johnson, to Col. Campbell at
Detroit, Major Murray at Fort Pitt, and Major
Farmar at Mobile, or on his way up the Mississippi,
and acquainted them with everything that
had happened since my departure from Fort
Pitt" (Hildreth's <i>Pioneer History</i>, p. 71; <i>N. Y.
Col. Doc.</i>, vii. 781). In the Butler journal, writing
from the same place, July 15, he said: "From
this post the Indians permitted me to write to
the commander at Fort Chartres [St. Ange];
but would not suffer me to write to anybody
else (this, I apprehend, was a precaution of the
French, lest their villainy should be perceived
too soon), although the Indians had given me
permission to write to Sir William Johnson and
to Fort Pitt on our march, before we arrived at
this place." In the summary of his report to
Sir William, he said: "In the situation I was in
at Ouatanon, with great numbers of Indians
about me, and no necessaries, such as paper and
ink, I had it not in my power to take down all
the speeches made by the Indian nations, nor
what I said to them, in so particular a manner
as I could wish." It is evident that Croghan
wrote many accounts of his journey, and only
three of them, as now appears, are accessible.
A biographical sketch of George Croghan, by
Dr. O'Callaghan, is in <i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, vii. 982,
983. For earlier traces of Croghan see Vol. V.
10, 596, 610.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, vii. 783; Hildreth's <i>Pioneer
History</i>, p. 75. Pontiac kept his promise, visited
Sir William Johnson in the spring, concluded
a peace, and departed laden with presents. He
returned to his village on the Maumee, and
little is known of him for the next three years.
He then reappeared in the Illinois country, and
visited his old friend M. St. Ange, who was in
command of the post of St. Louis, then under
Spanish rule. Like other Indians, Pontiac indulged
at times in the excessive use of intoxicating
liquors. Against the advice of his friend,
St. Ange, he attended an Indian drinking carousal,
at which he was waylaid and brained
with a hatchet by a Kaskaskia Indian, who had
been paid a barrel of rum by an English trader,
named Williamson, to commit the deed. St.
Ange claimed the body, and buried it with the
honors of war, in an unknown grave near the
fort of St. Louis. J. N. Nicollet, in his sketch
of St. Louis (p. 82), says: "This murder, which
roused the vengeance of all the Indian tribes
friendly to Pontiac, brought about the successive
wars and almost total extermination of the
Illinois nation. Pontiac was a remarkably well-looking
man, nice in his person, and full of taste
in his dress and in the arrangement of his exterior
ornaments. His complexion is said to have
approached that of the whites. His origin is
still uncertain, for some have supposed him to
belong to the Ottawas, others to the Miamis,
etc.; but Col. P. Chouteau, senior, who knew
him well, is of the opinion that he was a Nipissing."

The account of St. Ange's "Surrender of
Fort Chartres to M. Stirling on the 10th of Oct.,
1765", with a detailed description of the fort,
from the French archives, is in <i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>,

Nicollet (p. 81) states that "Capt. Stirling,
at the head of a company of Scots, arrived unexpectedly
in the summer of 1765;" and Parkman
(ii. 298), that "Capt. Stirling arrived at
Fort Chartres just as the snows of early winter
began to whiten the naked forests." The articles
of surrender are conclusive as to the fact
that the English troops arrived and took possession
of the Illinois country, October 10. Capt.
Stirling was relieved by Major Robert Farmar, of
the 34th regiment, about the time of which Parkman
speaks. Sir William, writing March 22,
1766, says: "Just now I have heard that Major
Farmar, who proceeded by the Mississippi, arrived
there [the Illinois] the 4th of December,
and relieved Capt. Stirling" (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, vii.
816; Stone's <i>Johnson</i>, ii. 251). Monette (i. 411)
states that "Capt. Stirling died in December;
that St. Ange returned to Fort Chartres, and
not long afterward Major Frazer, from Fort Pitt,
arrived as commandant." These errors have
been repeated scores of times, and the last repetition
I have seen is in F. L. Billon's <i>Annals of
St. Louis in early Days</i>, 1886, p. 26. Capt. Stirling
lived until 1808: served in the Revolutionary
War, became colonel in 1779, and later brigadier,
major-general, lieut.-general, general, and was
created a baronet. For a biographical sketch
of him, by Dr. O'Callaghan, see <i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>,
vii. 786; and for one of Major Farmar, <i>Ibid.</i>
775. F. S. Drake (<i>Biog. Dict.</i>) records Capt.
Stirling's extraordinary feat of marching his
company of Highlanders overland 3,000 miles,
from Fort Chartres to Philadelphia, without losing
a man. The facts were that Capt. Stirling
floated his company in boats down the Mississippi
to New Orleans; thence they sailed to
Pensacola, and later to New York, where they
arrived June 15, 1766. Gen. Gage, in a letter of
that date, wrote to Gov. Penn announcing their
arrival, stating that they would march on the
17th for Philadelphia, and asking that quarters
be assigned them (<i>Penna. Col. Rec.</i>, ix. 318).
No officer of the name of Frazer was ever in
command at Fort Chartres. Fort Chartres,
built by the French in 1720, was in its time the
strongest fortress in America. Its ruins are on
the left bank of the Mississippi, now a mile from
the river, in Randolph County, Ill., 50 miles
south of St. Louis, and 16 miles northeast of
Kaskaskia. It was abandoned in 1772, in consequence
of a portion of it being undermined by
a Mississippi flood. See Edw. G. Mason's <i>Old
Fort Chartres</i>, in Fergus's Historical Series, no.
12; Pittman, p. 45; Reynolds, <i>My own Time</i>, p.
26, ed. 1879; also his <i>Pioneer History</i>, p. 46,

In this interval between 1765 and 1774
there was a revival of the purpose of settlements
in the country watered by the Ohio and
its tributaries. The breaking up by the war of
the earlier enterprise of the Ohio Company (see
Vol. V., <i>ante</i>; Sparks in his <i>Washington</i>, ii. 483,
says its papers were entrusted to him fifty years
ago by Charles Fenton Mercer, of Virginia) had
led to a plan to buy out the French settlers in
Illinois (Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, vii. 356; Bigelow's
<i>Franklin</i>, i. 537, 547; ii. 112); and this being
abandoned, the earlier project had been merged
in the scheme known at first as Walpole's Grant,
and subsequently as the Colony of Vandalia,
which had derived some impetus immediately
after the conclusion of peace in 1763 by the publication
in London of <i>The Advantages of a Settlement
upon the Ohio</i> (now rare; copies in Harvard
College library; in <i>Carter-Brown Catal.</i>,
iii. 1363; Thomson's <i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>, no. 7), and
in Edinburgh of <i>The Expediency of securing our
American Colonies by settling the Country adjoining
the Mississippi River and the Country upon the
Ohio Considered</i> (Harvard College library, 6373.
33). The scheme had the countenance of Lord
Shelburne, and the Shelburne MSS., as calendared
in the <i>Hist. MSS. Com. Report</i>, v. p. 218
(vol. 50), show various papers appertaining.
Professor H. B. Adams, in the <i>Maryland Fund
Publications</i>, no. xi. p. 27, has marked the growth
of the perception of the importance of these
lands.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The grant was not secured till 1770, nor ratified
till 1772 (account in Sparks's <i>Franklin</i>, iv.
233, and <i>Washington</i>, ii. 483). Franklin had interested
himself in securing the grant against the
opposition of Hillsborough. See Franklin's letters
in <i>Works</i>, iv. 233; the adverse report of the
Lords of Trade (p. 303), and Franklin's reply to
it (p. 324). These last papers are also included
in <i>Biog. lit. and polit. Anecdotes of several of the
most Eminent persons of the present Age</i> (London,
1797), vol. ii. Provision was made for securing
out of this grant the lands promised to the Virginia
soldiers, in which Washington was so much
interested. The coming on of the Revolution
jeopardized the interests of the grantees, and in
1774 they petitioned the king that the establishment
of a government for Vandalia be no longer
delayed. Walpole, in May, 1775, was anxious at
the turn of affairs (<i>Hist. Mag.</i>, i. 86), and in 1776
the plan was abandoned. A memorial of Franklin
and Samuel Wharton, dated at Passy, Feb.
26, 1780, tracing the history of these lands, is in
the <i>Sparks MSS.</i>, no. xvii.</p>
<p class="pfc4">On the early settlers of Ohio at this time,

<p class="pfc4">The Filson Club of Louisville has published
(1886) Thomas Speed's <i>Wilderness road, a description
of the route of travel by which the pioneers
and early settlers first came to Kentucky</i>,
their previous publication having been Reuben
T. Durrett's <i>Life and Writings of John Filson,
the first historian of Kentucky</i> (1884), which gives
in fac-simile the earliest special map of Kentucky,
after a copy in Harvard College library,&mdash;most
copies of the book being without it,&mdash;for
while the <i>Discovery, Settlement, and Present
State of Kentucke</i> was printed in 1784, at Wilmington,
Del., the map was printed in Philadelphia,
and was an improvement upon the
general maps of Charlevoix, Evans, Hutchins,
Pownall, and others. Filson's book was issued
in French, at Paris, in 1785, and reprinted in
English in Imlay's <i>Topog. Description of North
America</i> (London, 1793 and 1797), in conjunction
with Imlay; again by Campbell in New
York, in 1793. Filson first presented to the
world the story of the adventures of Daniel
Boone in the appendix of his book, and from
that it has been copied and assigned to Boone
himself, in the <i>Amer. Museum</i>, Philadelphia, Oct.
1787, and in Samuel L. Metcalfe's <i>Collection of
some of the most interesting narratives of Indian
Warfare in the West</i> (Lexington, Ky., 1821,&mdash;Thomson's
<i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>, no. 818). The life
of Boone embodies much of the history of the
pioneer days of Kentucky. His subsequent biographers,
J. M. Peck (in Sparks's <i>Amer. Biog.</i>),
E. S. Ellis, G. C. Hill, H. T. Tuckerman (in his
<i>Biog. Essays</i>), C. W. Webber (in <i>Hist. and
Rev. Incidents</i>, Phil., 1861), Lossing (in <i>Harper's
Mag.</i>, xix.), and others, have depended upon
Filson. E. C. Coleman has told the story as it
is centred about Simon Kenton (<i>Ibid.</i> xxviii.),
and J. H. Perkins has given it more general
bearings in his "Pioneers of Kentucky", in <i>No.
Amer. Rev.</i>, Jan., 1846, included in his <i>Memoir

Carolina (J. E. M. Ramsey's <i>Annals of Tennessee</i>,

Capt. Cresap was then thirty-two years of
age, was a trader, and had had no experience
in a former war. His father, however,&mdash;Col.
Thomas Cresap,&mdash;was a noted Indian fighter.
Clark and his party evidently supposed it was
the father, and not the son, they were sending
for. The Cresaps were a Maryland family, and
the party who wanted a leader were Virginians.</p>

A few days before, a canoe from Pittsburg,
coming down the river, was fired on by Indians,
near Baker's Bottom, two white men killed and
one wounded. Baker's family had been warned,
and were preparing to leave for one of the forts.
Baker kept tavern, sold rum, and the Indians
across the river were his habitual customers.
Fearing an attack, he called in his neighbors.
Twenty-one of them responded, but kept out
of sight. A party of Indians appeared, and all
with the exception of Logan's brother became
very drunk. Logan's brother was drunk enough
to be insolent, and he attempted to strike one of
the white men. As he was leaving the house
with a coat and hat which he had stolen, the
white man whom he had abused shot him. The
neighbors rushed from their concealment and
killed the whole Indian party, except a half-breed
child whose father was Gen. John Gibson.
The Indians on the opposite shore, hearing
the firing, came over in canoes. They were
also fired on, and twelve of them were killed.
(See the statements of John Sappington and
others in Jefferson's <i>Notes on Virginia</i>, App. iv.,
1800, and later editions; and Withers's <i>Border
Warfare</i>, p. 113.)</p>

"I appeal to any white man to say if ever
he entered Logan's cabin hungry and he gave
him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked
and he clothed him not.... Col. Cresap, the
last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked, murdered
all the relations of Logan, not sparing
even my women and children. There runs not
a drop of my blood in the veins of any living
creature", etc.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Col. Thomas Cresap, well known in the West as
an Indian fighter, was the father of Capt. Michael
Cresap, and it is not strange that the rank of
the father should have been given to the son.
Public attention was not directed to Logan's
speech, or the comments of Jefferson on the
character of Capt. Cresap, until 1797, when
Luther Martin, an ardent Federalist and the
Attorney-General of Maryland (who had married
a daughter of Capt. Cresap), addressed a
public letter to an elocutionist, objecting to his
reciting "Logan's Speech", on the ground that
it was a slander on a noble man and patriot.
The speech itself, he stated, was probably never
made by Logan; and the letter had sneering
allusions to the claim that Jefferson was a philosopher.
Martin's letter is in <i>Olden Time</i>, ii.
51. Jefferson's letter to Gov. Henry of Maryland,
of Dec. 31, 1797 (<i>Writings</i>, viii. 309),
shows that he attributed Martin's attack to
political motives, and that his feelings were
greatly disturbed. He immediately set about
collecting testimony (1) to prove the genuineness
of Logan's speech, and (2) to justify the
charges he had made against Cresap. On the
first point, it was easy for him to show that he
had not invented the speech; that it was common
talk in Dunmore's camp; that he took it,
as he printed it, from the lips of some person in
Williamsburg in 1774, and that it was printed
at the time in the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>. It appears
that the speech was printed in the <i>Gazette</i> at
Williamsburg, Feb. 4, 1775, and that twelve
days later the speech, with important variations,
was sent by Madison to his friend William
Bradford, and was printed in a New York newspaper.
Both versions are in <i>Amer. Archives</i>,
4th series, i. 1020. (See also Rives's <i>Madison</i>,
i. 63, and Mayer's <i>Logan and Cresap</i>, p. 177.)
The fact that the speech as printed was actually
delivered was more difficult to prove, as it
depended wholly on the statement of Gen. John
Gibson, the interpreter. It will never be known
what part of it was Logan's and how much of
it was Gibson's. Jefferson was not successful
in justifying the charges he had made against
Cresap. Such of the collected evidence as answered
his purpose he printed in Appendix iv.
in the edition of his <i>Notes</i> of 1800 (Philadelphia).
Some copies of the appendix were
printed separately, and it was first mentioned
on the title-page in the edition printed at Trenton,
1803. (See <i>Writings</i>, viii. 457-476.) Such
of the testimony as did not answer his purpose
he suppressed. One of these suppressed statements
is the letter of George Rogers Clark to
Dr. Samuel Brown, already quoted. It was
found among his papers purchased by the
United States in 1848, and is now in the State
Department at Washington. Brantz Mayer vindicated
Cresap in a paper read before the Maryland
Historical Society in 1851, on <i>Logan the
Indian and Cresap the Pioneer</i>, and more fully
in <i>Tah-Gah-Jute, or Logan and Cresap</i> (Albany,
1867); Thomson, <i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>, nos. 805,
806. Dr. Joseph Doddridge, in his <i>Notes</i>, 1824
(reprinted 1876, and used by Kercheval, Winchester,
Va., 1833), made severe strictures on
Cresap, but did not charge him with killing Logan's
family. An extract from Doddridge, with
other matter, called <i>Logan, Chief of the Cayuga
Nation</i>, was published in Cincinnati by Wm.
Dodge in 1868. Doddridge's attack on Capt.
Cresap caused the Rev. John J. Jacob, who in
youth had been Cresap's clerk, and had accompanied
him in his Western expeditions, to write
his <i>Life</i> (Cumberland, Md., 1826; reprinted, with
notes and appendix, for Wm. Dodge, Cincinnati,
1866; Field's <i>Ind. Bibliog.</i>, nos. 769, 770; Thomson,
<i>Bibliog. of Ohio</i>, nos. 640-1). With slight
claim to literary merit, and much inaccuracy as
to dates, it contains some important documents,
and is an earnest vindication of Cresap's character.
Charges of baseness and cruelty against
Cresap were older than any publication of Logan's
speech. The early accounts which came to
Sir William Johnson charged the origin of the
war upon him. Writing June 20, 1774, Sir William
says: "I received the very disagreeable and
unexpected intelligence that a certain Mr. Cressop
[<i>sic</i>] had trepanned and murdered forty Indians
on the Ohio, ... and that the unworthy
author of this wanton act is fled.... Since the
news of the murders committed by Cressop and
his banditti, the Six Nations have sent me two
messages", etc., and much more of the same
character (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, viii. 459, 460, 461, 463,
471, 477; a biographical sketch of Cresap by
Dr. O'Callaghan is on p. 459). The subject is
treated in <i>Olden Time</i>, ii. 44, 49-67; Potter's
<i>Amer. Monthly</i>, xi. 187; <i>Old and New</i>, x. 436;
<i>New Eclectic</i>, 169; <i>Annual Report, 1879, of
the Sec. of State</i>, Ohio, Columbus, 1880; Stone's

Jour. Science</i>, xxxi. 11; Withers's <i>Border Warfare</i>,
p. 118; <i>Amer. Pioneer</i>, i. 7-24, 64, 188, 331.
The <i>Amer. Pioneer</i>, 1842-43, was the organ of
the "Logan Historical Society", the object of
the society being to erect a monument to Logan,
on which "his speech as given by Thomas Jefferson
shall be fully engraved in gilt letters."
The title is a full-page woodcut, representing
Logan and Gen. Gibson sitting on a log, the
former making his "speech" and the latter taking
it down.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Capt. Cresap, in June, 1775, enlisted a company
of one hundred and thirty riflemen in
Maryland, twenty-two of whom were his old
companions-in-arms from the country west of
the Alleghanies, and marched them to Boston
in twenty-two days. Here his health gave way,
and he was compelled to return. He reached
New York, and there died, Oct. 18, 1775, at the
age of thirty-three. His gravestone is in Trinity
churchyard, New York city, opposite the
door of the north transept. An accurate woodcut
of his gravestone is in Mayer's <i>Logan and
Cresap</i>, p. 144, and in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, Nov., 1876,
p. 808. A view of his house is in <i>Harper's Mag.</i>,

George Rogers Clark's own narratives furnish
the most authentic information concerning
his Illinois campaigns, three of which are accessible
in print, as follow in the order of their
dates: (1) Letter to the governor of Virginia,
dated Kaskaskia, April 29, 1779, concerning his
capture of Vincennes (in Jefferson's <i>Writings</i>,
i. 222-226). (2) Letter to George Mason, dated
Louisville, Falls of Ohio, November 19, 1779,
which covers the period from setting out on his
second visit to Virginia, in the autumn of 1777,
to the end of his Vincennes campaign. It is
printed from the original MS. in the <i>Collections</i>
of the Hist. Soc. of Kentucky, with an introduction
by Henry Pirtle; a biographical sketch of
Clark; and the journal of Capt. (later Major)
Joseph Bowman in the expedition against Vincennes.
It is one of the <i>Ohio Valley Series</i>, Cincinnati,
1869, and is here quoted as <i>Clark's Campaign</i>.
(3) "Memoirs composed by himself at
the united desire of Presidents Jefferson and
Madison", printed (with omissions and interpolations)
in Dillon's <i>Indiana</i> (1843, pp. 127-184; and
2d ed., 1859, pp. 114-170). The second edition is
here quoted. H. W. Beckwith used extracts from
the same in his <i>Historic Notes on the Northwest</i>,
pp. 245-259. It is the most extended of the
three narratives. The original, with a large mass
of other MSS. of, and relating to, Geo. Rogers
Clark, is in the possession of Dr. Lyman C.
Draper, of Madison, Wis. The date when it
was written is not given; but it must have been
written more than twelve years after the events
occurred which it describes. Jefferson, writing
March 7, 1791, to Col. James Innes, concerning
Col. Clark, said: "We are made to hope
he is engaged in writing the accounts of his expeditions
north of the Ohio. They will be valuable
morsels of history, and will justify to the
world those who have told them how great he
was" (<i>Writings</i>, iii. 218). Mann Butler's account
of Clark's exploits (<i>Hist. of Kentucky</i>,
pp. 35-88) is highly seasoned with popular traditions,
and with incidents which are not consistent
with Clark's own statements; and yet Butler
has been more frequently quoted than the narratives
of Clark. (4) The Canadian Archives, at
Ottawa, has a journal of Clark, dated Vincennes,
Feb. 24, 1779, the day of the surrender, which
has never been printed nor quoted. (See report
of Douglas Brymner, archivist, for 1882, p. 27,
where an abstract of the report is given.) This
is Clark's original report on his Vincennes campaign
to the governor of Virginia. Three days
after the surrender, a messenger arrived at Vincennes
with despatches from the governor. On
the 14th of March this messenger (whom Clark
calls William <i>Myres</i>; Bowman, <i>Mires</i>; the Canadian
Calendar, <i>Moires</i>; and Jefferson, <i>Morris</i>)
was sent back to Williamsburg with letters to
the governor. Near the Falls of the Ohio he
was killed by the Indians, and the report of
Clark, with nine other letters captured upon
him, appear in the <i>Haldimand Collection</i> in the
Canadian Archives. Clark, writing to Jefferson
April 29th, mentions that he had heard of the
killing of his messenger, "news very disagreeable
to me, as I fear many of my letters will fall
into the hands of the enemy at Detroit, although
some of them, as I learn, were found in the
woods, torn to pieces" (Jefferson's <i>Writings</i>, i.
222; see also Dillon, p. 159). Copies of these
captured documents I have received from Ottawa.
Clark's report is very interesting, and
gives details of his interviews with Gov. Hamilton,
while negotiating the surrender, which are
omitted in his later narratives, and show that he
treated Hamilton as if he believed he was responsible
for the Indian barbarities inflicted
upon the frontier settlers. (5) The <i>report of
Gov. Hamilton</i> to Gen. Haldimand, July 6, 1781,
which is an extended and detailed narrative of
his expedition from Detroit to Vincennes in the
autumn and early winter of 1778, of his capture by
Clark, and of his long imprisonment in Virginia.
He gives many facts and incidents which have
not before appeared. He earnestly defends himself
against the charges of cruelty made by
Clark and the Virginia Assembly; and while
admitting that, under instructions of his government,
he sent out parties of Indians against
the white settlements, he claims that he always
gave the savages special instructions to be merciful,
and that they obeyed him! This document,
which has not been used by any writer, or
been accessible until recently, is important, and
is about the only statement we have giving the
British view of the Vincennes campaign. With
sixty other early manuscripts relating to the
Northwest, it was kindly furnished to me by Mr.
B. F. Stevens, of London, who copied it from the
family papers of Lord George Germain. It now
appears that it is also in the <i>Haldimand Collection</i>
in the British Museum and in the Canadian Archives.
It has lately been printed in the <i>Michigan
Pioneer Collections</i>, ix. 489-516.</p>

Butler (p. 52) says "two divisions crossed
the river, while Clark with the third division took
possession of the fort on this [the east] side of
the river, in point-blank shot of the town." It
is now the popular belief of the residents in the
vicinity, and it has been the positive statement
of all writers on the subject, that the fort in
which Col. Clark captured Rocheblave was on
the high bluff opposite the town, where there is
still abundant evidence that a fort once existed,
and now is known by the name of "Fort Gage."
The spot is daily pointed out to visitors as perhaps
the most noted locality in the Western
country. During the past year a historical painting
(40×20 feet), illustrating Col. Clark's capture
of Kaskaskia, has been placed on the walls
of the State House at Springfield, Ill. In the
centre of the picture is the site of the old fort on
the bluff, and near it stands the Jesuit church. In
the foreground is Col. Clark addressing a council
of Indians. There are three historical infelicities
in this picture. The council of Indians
which is here represented, was not held at Kaskaskia,
but at Cahokia, sixty miles distant. The
Jesuit church, and the actual fort which Clark
captured, were on the other, the western, side of
the river. Only a few points in justification of
this statement can be mentioned:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">(1.) The fort on the bluff opposite the town
"was burnt down in October, 1766", says Pittman
(p. 43), who visited Kaskaskia about that
time, or soon after, and whose book was published
in London in 1770. He gives a description
and detailed drawing of the town, the river,
and site of the old fort. "It [the old fort] <i>was</i>",
he says, "an oblongular quadrangle, 290 by 251
feet; it <i>was</i> built of very thick squared timber",
etc.,&mdash;using in every instance the past tense.
"An officer and 20 soldiers are quartered in the
village." The evidence that the old fort was
ever rebuilt is wanting.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(2.) No incident appears in the contemporary
narratives that Clark occupied, or even visited,
the site of the old fort; and there are many allusions
to his occupying quarters in the town.
On one occasion, expecting an attack from the
enemy, he resolved to burn the houses around
the fort. "I was necessitated", he says, "to set
fire to some of the houses <i>in town</i>, to clear them
out of the way." The people came to him in distress,
fearing he would burn up their town. He
took an occasion for doing this when there was
snow on the roofs, and only such houses were
burned as were set on fire (<i>Campaign</i>, p. 59). The
site of the old fort was 500 yards from the river,
and the river was 150 yards wide. A fire there
would not have endangered the town; and Pittman's
plan shows no houses on the eastern
bank, around the old fort.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(3.) Setting out for Vincennes on the 5th of
February, 1779, Clark says: "We crossed the
Kaskaskia River with 170 men" (Dillon, p. 139).
Major Bowman, in his journal of the same date,
wrote: "About three o'clock we crossed the
Kaskaskia with our baggage, and marched about
a league from town" (p. 100). Crossing the
Kaskaskia would have been unnecessary if they
had been quartered on the site of the old fort.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(4.) Clark had heard from the hunters who
joined him on the way, and had been in the
town eight days before, that the fort was kept in
good order, and that the garrison was on the
alert. He was too good a soldier, on such information,
to divide his scanty force of less than
two hundred men into three divisions, and with
one of them attack an isolated fort on the opposite
side of the river, where he could have no
support from his other divisions. Bowman, in
a letter to Col. Hite, said: "This town was sufficiently
fortified to have resisted a thousand
men." That Clark passed the site of the old
fort without approaching or even mentioning it,
and threw his men across the river a mile north
of the town, is evidence that the site of the old
fort was then unoccupied.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(5.) M. Rocheblave, writing from Kaskaskia,
"Fort Gage, Feb. 8, 1778", to Gen. Carleton at
Montreal, shows conclusively where the fort was
situated in which he was taken prisoner by
Clark five months later. The MS. is in the Canadian
Archives (Brymner's <i>Report of 1882</i>, p.
12). Rocheblave reports that "the roof of the
mansion of the fort is of shingles and very
leaky, notwithstanding my efforts to patch it;
and unless a new roof be provided very soon, the
building, which was constructed twenty-five years
ago and cost the <i>Jesuits</i> 40,000 piastres, will be
ruined." By a decree of the king, the Jesuits
were suppressed in France and its colonies in
1763, and their property was confiscated to the
crown. The Jesuits had a valuable estate at
Kaskaskia which was taken possession of by
the French commandant, and the priests were
expelled. Father Watrin, Jesuit, in his <i>Memoir
of the Missions of Louisiana</i>, 1764 or 1765 (<i>Mag.
of West. Hist.</i> i. 265), says "When the Jesuits
of the Illinois, recalled by the decree against
them, passed this post [Point Coupée, on the
Mississippi], Father Irenæus [a Capuchin] received
and treated them as though they had
been brothers." Such of the property as was
needed for public use was retained, and the remainder
was sold. "The Jesuits' plantation",
says Pittman (p. 43), "consisted of 240 <i>arpens</i>
[200 acres] of cultivated land, a very good
stock of cattle, and a brewery, which was sold
by the French commandant, after the country
was ceded to the English, for the [French] crown,
in consequence of the suppression of the order."
This sale must have taken place before the
English occupation, in 1765. Pittman mentions
the church and the "Jesuits' house" as "the
principal buildings, which are built of stone, and,
considering this part of the world, make a very
good appearance." The Jesuits' house was
doubtless the one mentioned by Rocheblave, the
fort being adjacent to it. On his plan of Kaskaskia
Pittman locates the church in the centre
of the town, and the Jesuits' property at the
southeast corner, near the river. Pittman returned
to Pensacola from Illinois in the spring
of 1767, "with the plan of a fort", which, Haldimand
reports to Gage, will "cost a good deal
of money" (<i>Haldimand Coll.</i>, p. 25). In 1772
Fort Chartres was abandoned in consequence of
being undermined during an inundation of the
Mississippi. Gen. Gage gave the order March
16, 1772, and directed that the troops be stationed
at Kaskaskia. After the capture of the
fort in 1778, the name was changed to "Fort
Clark" (Bowman, p. 110; <i>Canad. Arch.</i>, 1882,
p. 36). I have found no instance where the old
fort on the bluff, burned in 1766, and now known
as "Fort Gage", had that name during the period
when it existed as a fort.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(6.) Lieut. Ross's <i>Map of the Mississippi from
the Balise to Fort Chartres, made late in 1765,
improved from the French surveys</i>, and published
in London in 1775, places "Ft. Caskaskias" at
the southeast corner of the town, on the west
bank of the river,&mdash;the spot indicated in Rocheblave's
letter. It shows no fort on the eastern
bank.</p>
<p class="pfc4">(7.) Major De Peyster, writing June 27, 1779,
from Michilimacinac to Gen. Haldimand, reports
concerning affairs at Kaskaskia, and fixes
without question the location of the fort. He
says: "The Kaskaskias no ways fortified; the
fort being still a sorry pinchetted [picketted?]
enclosure round the Jesuits' college." (<i>Mich.
Pion. Coll.</i> ix. 388.)</p>
<p class="pfc4">It is remarkable that Gov. Reynolds, who resided
at Kaskaskia in 1800, should not have
known the location of "Fort Gage"; or, rather,
that the local remembrances of the real spot
should have faded out in twenty-one years. He
says (in <i>My Own Times</i>, p. 31, ed. 1879): "The
English government [in 1772] abandoned Fort
Chartres and established its authority at Fort
Gage, on the bluff east of Kaskaskia." Again, he
says (<i>Pioneer History</i>, p. 81, ed. 1887): "The British
garrison occupied Fort Gage, which stood on
the Kaskaskia river bluffs opposite the village."
This, in his mind, was the location of the fort
which Clark captured. He says (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 94):
"Two parties crossed the river; the other party
remained with Col. Clark to attack the fort."</p>
<p class="pfc4">Capt. Bowman, in letter to Col. Hite of July
30, 1778 (Almon's <i>Remembrancer</i>, 1779, p. 82),
describes the march and capture as follows:
"Marched for Kaskaskia with four days' provisions,
and in six days arrived at the place in the
night of the 4th instant, having marched two
days without any sustenance, in which hungry
condition we unanimously determined to take
the town, or die in the attempt. About midnight
we marched into the town without being discovered.
Our object was the fort, which we soon got
possession of; the commanding officer (Philip
Rocheblave) we made prisoner, and he is now
on his way to Williamsburg under a strong
guard, <i>with all his instructions</i> from time to
time, from the several governors at Detroit,
Quebec, etc., to set the Indians upon us, with
great rewards for our scalps, for which he has a
salary of £200 per year." This statement shows
that the fort was in the town, and controverts
the assertion of Butler (p. 53) that the public
papers in the fort were not captured, out of delicacy
to the wife of the commander, she "presuming
a good deal on the gallantry of our
countrymen by imposing upon their delicacy towards
herself." ... "Better, ten thousand times
better", Butler adds, "were it so, than that the
ancient fame of the sons of Virginia should have
been tarnished by insult to a female!"</p>

Of M. Rocheblave very little is known. His
full name, Philippe François de Rastel, Chevalier
de Rocheblave, with his nativity, appears in
the parish records of Kaskaskia for April 11,
1763, in the third publication of the banns of
his marriage to Michel Marie Dufresne (E. G.
Mason's <i>Kaskaskia</i>, p. 17). He is mentioned in
1756 (<i>N. Y. Col. Doc.</i>, x. 435) as a cadet at Fort
Duquesne; in July, 1757, on the Potomac (<i>Ibid.</i>
581); and in July, 1759, at Niagara (<i>Ibid.</i> 992).
Many of his letters [in French] are in the Canadian
Archives. Several of them which I have,
show him to have been a man of sensibility and
refinement. He said he was a British subject
because he had been abandoned by France at
the peace. One of them is a long and interesting
letter dated at "Fort Gage, July 4, 1778",
which was probably sent off by boat a few hours
before he was captured by Col. Clark. He was
a prisoner in Virginia until the autumn of 1780,
when he broke his parole and went to New York
(Jefferson's <i>Writings</i>, i. 258). His family were
left at Kaskaskia; and Gov. Henry of Virginia,
in his instructions to Col. John Todd, Dec. 12,
1778, says: "Mr. Rocheblave's wife and family
must not suffer for want of that property of
which they were bereft by our troops. It is to
be restored to them, if possible. If this cannot
be done, the public must support them." (<i>Calendar
of Va. Papers</i>, i. 314). His wife, signing
her name "Marie Michel de Rocheblave", wrote
from Kaskaskia, March 27, 1780, to Gen. Haldimand,
appealing to his humanity for pecuniary
help, as the rebels had taken everything from
her but her debts. (MS. letter furnished to me
by Mr. B. F. Stevens.)</p>

The only garrison left in the fort when Gov.
Hamilton and his troops appeared was Capt.
Helm and his one soldier, whose name was Moses
Henry. The latter placed a loaded cannon at
the open gate, and Capt. Helm, standing by with
a lighted match, commanded the British troops
to halt. Hamilton demanded the surrender of
the garrison. Helm refused, and asked for terms.
Hamilton replied that they should have the honors
of war, and the terms were accepted. The
comical aspect of the garrison, consisting of one
officer and one soldier, marching out of the fort
between lines of disgusted Indians on one side
and British soldiers on the other, is happily illustrated
in Gay's <i>Hist. of U. S.</i>, iii. 612. See note
in Clark's <i>Campaign</i>, p. 52; Butler's <i>Hist. of
Kentucky</i>, p. 80; Monette, i. 425; Perkins's
<i>Annals</i>, p. 207. Gov. Hamilton describes the
surrender without mentioning this humorous
incident, thus: "The officer who commanded
in the fort, Capt. Helm, being deserted by the
[resident French] officers and men, who to the
number of seventy had formed his garrison, and
were in pay of the Congress, surrendered his
wretched fort on the very day of our arrival, being
the 17th day of December, 1778." (Report
of July 6, 1781.)</p>

Gov. Reynolds (<i>Pioneer History</i>, p. 101, ed.
1887) says Col. Vigo was sent to Vincennes by
Clark as a spy; that he was captured by the
Indians and taken to Hamilton, who suspected
the character of his mission; and that he was
released on the ground of his being a Spanish
subject, and having influential friends among the
French residents. Hamilton in his report makes
no mention of Vigo by name, but says that men
were stationed at the mouth of the Wabash to
intercept boats on the Ohio; and that they at
different times brought in prisoners and prevented
intelligence being carried from Vincennes
to the Illinois, "till the desertion of a corporal
and six men from La Mothe's company, in the
latter end of January, who gave the first intelligence
to Col. Clark of our arrival." In Reynolds's
<i>Pion. Hist.</i> p. 423, is a biographical sketch
of Col. Vigo, by H. W. Beckwith, and a portrait.
See also Law's <i>History of Vincennes</i>, pp. 28-30.
Vigo helped Clark by cashing his drafts, and the
story of a consequent suit for recovery of the
money, which did not end till 1876 in the U. S.
Supreme Court, is told by C. C. Baldwin in the
<i>Mag. of West. Hist.</i>, Jan., 1885, p. 230.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Clark, in his letter to George Mason, scarcely
alludes to the sufferings endured on this march.
He says: "If I was sensible that you would let
no person see this relation, I would give you a
detail of our sufferings for four days in crossing
these waters, and the manner it was done, as I
am sure you would credit it; but it is too incredible
for any person to believe except those that
are as well acquainted with me as you are, or
had experienced something similar to it. I hope
you will excuse me until I have the pleasure of
seeing you personally" (<i>Campaign</i>, p. 66). In
his later narrative he spoke on the subject more
freely (Dillon, 139-146), and his account is confirmed
by Bowman's journal.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1510_1510" id="Footnote_1510_1510"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1510_1510"><span class="label">[1510]</span></a></span>
She arrived on the 27th, three days after the
surrender, "to the great mortification of all on
board that they had not the honor to assist us",
says Bowman. Clark, in his captured report,
writing on the same day, says: "The Willing
arrived at 3 o'clock. She was detained by the
strong current on the Wabash and Ohio; two
Lieutenants and 48 men, with two iron four-pounders
and five swivels on board."</p>

An allusion to Gov. Hamilton's practice of
paying the Indians for scalps, and not for prisoners.
The proclamation is in Dillon, p. 146;

Bowman gives (p. 105-108) the correspondence
with Hamilton, the articles of capitulation,
etc., some of which are omitted in Clark's
narratives. Hamilton in his <i>Report</i> describes
Clark's demand on him to surrender thus:
"About eight o'clock a flag of truce from the
rebels appeared, carried by Nicolas Cardinal, a
captain of the militia of St. Vincennes, who delivered
me a letter from Col. Clark requiring
me to surrender at discretion; adding, with an
oath, that if I destroyed any stores or papers,
I should be treated as a murtherer." Hamilton
asserts that Clark was supplied with gunpowder
by the inhabitants of Vincennes, "his
own, to the last ounce, being damaged [by
water] on the march;" and that "Clark has since
told me he knew to a man those of my little
garrison who would do their duty, and those who
would shrink from it. There is no doubt he was
well informed."</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1513_1513" id="Footnote_1513_1513"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1513_1513"><span class="label">[1513]</span></a></span>
Hamilton in his <i>Report</i> enlarges on the barbarity
of this transaction. The indignation and
resentment felt by Clark and his men towards
Hamilton, and the occasion for it, appear in a
conversation concerning the terms of surrender,
which Clark gives in his captured despatch:
"<i>Hamilton.</i> 'Col. Clark, why will you force me
to dishonor myself when you cannot acquire more
honor by it?' <i>Clark.</i> 'Could I look on you as a
gentleman, I would do the utmost in my power;
but on you, who have imbrued your hands in the
blood of our women and children&mdash;honor, my
country, everything, calls aloud for vengeance.'
<i>Hamilton.</i> 'I know, sir, my character has been
stained, but not deservedly; for I have always
endeavored to instill humanity, as much as in
my power, in the Indians, whom the orders of
my superiors obliged me to employ.' <i>Clark.</i>
'Sir, speak no more on this subject; my blood
glows within my veins to think on the cruelties
your Indian parties have committed; therefore,
repair to your fort, and prepare for battle'&mdash;on
which I turned off."</p>
<p class="pfc4">The following incidents illustrate the sort of
humanity which Hamilton, and other British
commandants at Detroit, instilled in the Indian
mind: At a council, on July 3, 1778, Gov. Hamilton
presented an axe to the chief, saying: "It is
the king's command that I put this axe into your
hands to act against his majesty's enemies. I
pray the Lord of life to give you success, as also
your warriors, wherever you go with your father's
axe." The item "60 gross scalping-knives" are

wanted for Indian presents at Detroit from
Aug. 21, 1782, to Aug. 20, 1783", signed by A. S.
De Peyster, Lieut.-Gov. (Farmer's <i>Hist. of Detroit</i>,

that he has seen the original entry of sale, on

£80;" and on July 22d, of 24 dozen more
to the same parties.</p>

Among Hamilton's reasons, in the articles
of capitulation, for surrender were: "The honorable
terms allowed, and lastly, the confidence
in a generous enemy." For this compliment to
Clark he apologized in his <i>Report</i> as follows:
"If it be considered that we were to leave our
wounded men at the mercy of a man who had
shown such instances of ferocity, as Col. Clark
had lately done, a compliment bespeaking his
generosity and humanity may possibly find excuse
with some, as I know it has censure from
others."</p>

Hamilton says: "The day before Capt.
Helm, who commanded the party sent to take
the convoy, arrived at Ouattanon, Mr. Dejean
heard that we had fallen into the hands of the
rebels; but he had not sufficient presence of
mind to destroy the papers which, with everything
else, was seized by the rebels. Besides the
provision, clothing, and stores belonging to the
king, all the private baggage of the officers fell
into the possession of Col. Clark."</p>

On March 7th, "Capt. Williams and Lieut.
Rogers, with twenty-five men, set off for the
Falls of Ohio to conduct the following prisoners,
viz.: Lieut.-Gov. Hamilton, Major Hays
[Hay], Capt. La Mothe [La Mothe], Mons. Dejean,
grand judge of Detroit, Lieut. Shiflin
[Scheifflin], Doct. M'Beth [McBeath], Francis
M'Ville [Maisonville], Mr. Bell Fenilb [Bellefeuille],
with eighteen privates" (Bowman, p. 109).
Hamilton does not give a list of his fellow-prisoners,
but the above names, as he gives them
elsewhere in his <i>Report</i>, are inserted in brackets.
He says: "On the 8th of March we were put
into a heavy oak boat, being 27 in number, with
our provision of flour and pork at common ration,
and 14 gallons of spirits for us and our
guard, which consisted of 23 persons, including
two officers. We had before us 360 miles of
water carriage and 840 to march to our place of
destination, Williamsburg, Va." (<i>Mich. Pion. Col.</i>,
p. 506). "On the 16th, most of the prisoners took
the oath of neutrality, and got permission to set
out for Detroit" (<i>Ibid.</i> 110). Gov. Hamilton and
his associates were sent to Williamsburg, and by
sentence of the executive council were placed in
close imprisonment in irons, for their treatment
of captives and for permitting and instigating the
Indians to practise every species of cruelty and
barbarism upon American citizens, without distinction
of age, sex, or condition (see <i>Journals
of Congress</i>, ii. 340; Jefferson's <i>Writings</i>, i. 226-237,

officers (<i>Sparks MSS.</i>, no. lxvi.).</p>

Gen. Washington instructed Col. Brodhead
to see that no Continental officer outranked
Col. Clark. "I do not think", he wrote, "that
the charge of the enterprise could have been
committed to better hands. I have not the
pleasure of knowing the gentleman personally;
but independently of the proofs he has given
of his activity and address, the unbounded confidence
which, I am told, the Western people
repose in him is a matter of vast importance....
In general, give every countenance and
assistance to this enterprise. I shall expect a
punctual compliance with this order. Col. Clark
will probably be the bearer of this himself"

<i>Writings</i>, i. 288. See Steuben's report to
Washington, Sparks's <i>Corresp.</i>, etc., iii. 204. At
the time of Arnold's descent on Virginia, a
scheme was devised by Jefferson and Baron
Steuben to capture the arch-traitor alive, and
hang him. The scheme is set forth in a letter
of Jefferson, with no address (<i>Writings</i>, i. 289),
dated Richmond, Jan. 21, 1781; and it immediately
follows the one describing Col. Clark's
ambuscade. The purpose of the letter is to
enlist the services of the person addressed in
this hazardous enterprise. The writer says he
has "peculiar confidence in the men from the
western side of the mountains, whose courage
and fidelity would be above all doubt. Your
perfect knowledge of those men personally, and
my confidence in your discretion, induces me
to ask you to pick from among them proper
characters, in such numbers as you think best,
and engage them to undertake to seize and
bring off this greatest of all traitors. Whether
this may be best effected by their going in
as friends and awaiting their opportunity, or
otherwise, is left to themselves. The smaller
the number the better, so that they be sufficient
to manage him." He offers them a reward
of five thousand guineas for bringing him
off alive, and says "their names will be recorded
with glory in history with those of Vanwert,
Paulding, and Williams." The editor states in a
note that the person addressed "was probably
Gen. [John Peter Gabriel] Mühlenberg." Gen.
Mühlenberg was a Pennsylvanian, and never resided
west of the mountains. The person was
doubtless George Rogers Clark, who was then
in Virginia, and was too deeply interested in
his Detroit expedition to engage in the scheme.</p>

<i>Ibid.</i> iii. 455. "I think", Gen. Irvine adds,
"there is too much reason to fear that Gen.
Clark's and Col. Gibson's expeditions falling
through will greatly encourage the savages to
fall on the country with double fury, or perhaps
the British from Detroit to visit this post
[Fort Pitt], which, instead of being in a tolerable
state of defence, is, in fact, nothing but a
heap of ruins." The relations of Detroit to
the war in the Northwest, as the centre of British
intrigues among the Indians, and of British
instigation of the savages to make forays on
the region of the Ohio, is well set forth in
Charles I. Walker's <i>Northwest during the Revolution</i>,
the annual address before the Wisconsin
Hist. Soc. in 1871 (Madison, 1871; also in <i>Pioneer
Soc. of Michigan Coll.</i>, iii., Lansing, 1881).
A plan of the Detroit River at this time is
given in Parkman's <i>Pontiac</i>, vol. i. Col. Arent
Schuyler De Peyster, who commanded at Detroit,
1776-1785, gives something of his experiences
in his <i>Miscellanies by an Officer</i> (Dumfries,
1813). The latest history of Detroit is
Silas Farmer's <i>Detroit and Michigan</i> (Detroit,
1884), where, in ch. 39, the revolutionary story
is told. He has retold it in the <i>Mag. of Western
Hist.</i>, Jan., 1886.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Brymner's <i>Report on the Canadian Archives</i>,
1882, p. 11, calendars the correspondence and
papers relating to Detroit, 1772-1784, being in
large part the correspondence of Gov. Hamilton
and Carleton, including letters from Vincennes
and intercepted letters of G. R. Clark.
Much of the military correspondence with the
commandants at Detroit and Quebec, during
this period, are in the series "America and West
Indies" of the Public Record Office, vols. cxxi.,

In Jefferson's <i>Writings</i>, iii. 217, 218, and <i>Cal.
Va. State Papers</i>, iv. 189, 202, will be found some
sad incidents which throw light on the habits
and subsequent record of Col. Clark. In 1793
he imprudently accepted from Genet, the French
minister, a position in the service of France, with
the rank of major-general and commander-in-chief
of the French revolutionary legions on the
Mississippi River. The purpose of this revolutionary
scheme, which had many supporters in
Kentucky and the West, was "to open the trade
of the said river and give freedom to the inhabitants",
by capturing and holding the Spanish
settlements on the Mississippi. The troops were
to receive pay as French soldiers, and donations
of land in the conquered districts. Before the
scheme could be put into execution, a counter-revolution
occurred in France, Genet was recalled,
and Clark's commission was cancelled.
See Collins's <i>Kentucky</i>, i. 277; ii. 140; McMaster,
<i>Hist. of U. S.</i>, ii. 142; Washington's Message
against Genet and his scheme is in <i>Writings</i>, xii.
96. For Clark's reputation and the achievements
up to 1781, see Marshall's <i>Washington</i>, iii. 562;

"the Hannibal of the West", and by Gov. John
Reynolds "the Washington of the West." He
was never married. He died February 13, 1818,
and was buried at Locust Grove, near Louisville,
Ky.</p>
<p class="pfc4">The only portrait of him extant was painted
by John W. Jarvis, an English artist, who began
business in New York in 1801, and painted
the heads of many distinguished Americans.
He made a trip West and South, during which
he made many portraits. The picture of Clark
represents him about sixty years of age. The
best engraving of it is in the <i>National Portrait
Gallery</i>, iv., with a biography. It is the frontispiece
of Butler's <i>Kentucky</i>, 1834, of Dillon's <i>Indiana</i>,
1859, and in the Cincinnati edition of
<i>Clark's Campaign</i>; and woodcuts are in Lossing's
<i>Field-Book</i>, ii. 287; <i>Mag. of Western Hist.</i>,
ii. 133; <i>Harper's Mag.</i>, xxviii. 302, etc. It has
been many times reproduced, with a modification
of details. There have been many rumors
as to the existence of a portrait taken earlier
in life. Every alleged portrait of an earlier date
which I could hear of, I have looked up, and
find that they are all copies or modifications of
the Jarvis picture.</p>

In 1772, the whole community of Moravian
missionaries and their Indian converts at Friedenshütten,
in Pennsylvania, where they had
dwelt for seven years, removed to the valley of
the Muskingum, on the cordial invitation of the
Delawares. For many years, when living in the
vicinity of the English settlements, they had suffered
much from persecution; but now that
they had their home among savages, it seemed

Col. Crawford was a friend of Washington,
and had been one of his surveyors. "It is with
the greatest sorrow", wrote Washington, "that
I have learned the melancholy tidings of Col.
Crawford's death. He was known to me as an
officer of much prudence, brave, experienced,
and active. The manner of his death was shocking
to me, and I have this day communicated to

For a summary of these discussions, see
Perkins, <i>Annals</i> (Peck's ed., 1850), pp. 242-250.
Judge Hall, <i>Sketches of the West</i>, i. 171, gives the
date "May 6, 1778"; Wilson Primm, <i>Historical
Address</i>, 1847 (reprinted in <i>Western Journal</i>,
1849, ii. 71), gives "May, 1779", as the date, and
says 1779 is an era in the history of St. Louis,
and is designated as "L'Année du coup." Nicollet,
<i>Early St. Louis</i>, gives "May, 6, 1780", and
Martin, <i>Louisiana</i>, "the fall of 1780." Stoddard,
<i>Sketches of Louisiana</i>, without naming the month
and day, gives the year and the main facts correctly;
but errs in stating that "the expedition
was not sanctioned by the English court, and
the private property of the commandant was
seized to pay the expenses of it." As to the
casualties, Stoddard (p. 80) says, "60 killed and
30 prisoners;" Nicollet (p. 85), "60 killed and
13 prisoners;" Primm, "20 killed;" and Billon,
<i>Annals of St. Louis</i>, 1886 (p. 196), "seven persons
were killed", and he furnishes a list of their
names. Sinclair, in report to Haldimand, July
8, 1780, says: "At Pencour [St. Louis], 68 were
killed, and 18 blacks and white people taken
prisoners; 43 scalps were brought in. The rebels
lost an officer and three men killed at the
Cahokias, and five prisoners" (<i>Mich. Pion. Col.</i>,
ix. 559). Martin (ii. 53) says "Clark released
about 50 prisoners that had been made."</p>

In March, 1766, Ulloa, from Havana, landed
at New Orleans, and in the name of Spain took
possession of Louisiana; but found himself
obliged to administer the government under the
old French officers, and in 1768 the French set
up for a while a republic independent of Spain.

"In compliance with my Lord George Germain's
requisition in the circular letter sent from
Detroit on 22d January, I sent a war party of
Indians to the country of the Sioux to put that
nation in motion under their own chief, Wabasha,
a man of uncommon abilities.... They
are directed to proceed with all despatch to the
Natchez, and to act afterwards as circumstances
may require. I shall send other bands of Indians
from thence on the same service as soon
as I can with safety disclose the object of their
mission. I am at a loss to judge in point of
time, and can only hazard an opinion that the
Brigadier [Campbell] and his army will be at the
place of their destination some time in May"
(<i>Michigan Pioneer Coll.</i>, ix. 544).</p>
<p class="pfc4">The same day, Sinclair wrote to Capt. Brehm,
Haldimand's aide-de-camp: "I will use my utmost
endeavors to send away as many as I can of
the Indians to attack the Spanish settlements as
low down [the Mississippi] as they possibly can,
in order to procure the assistance of the others
at home. I am so perfectly convinced of the
general's [Haldimand's] geographical knowledge
that I do not know where to look for the cause of
a doubt about giving some aid to General Campbell
from this quarter.... I am at a loss to
know whether this preparation may not be too
early, on account of want of secrecy in the people
I have employed, and from their getting too
near [New] Orleans before the arrival of the
brigadier. I have confidence in and hopes of
their leader, as Wabasha is allowed to be a very
extraordinary Indian, and well attached to his
majesty's interest" (<i>Ibid.</i> pp. 541-543).</p>
<p class="pfc4">February 17, he writes again to Haldimand,
that the Minomines, Puants, Sacs, and Rhenards
were to assemble at the portage of the Wisconsin
and Fox rivers under a Mr. Hesse, a trader; and
later to rendezvous at the confluence of the Mississippi
and Wisconsin rivers, Prairie du Chien.
"The reduction of Pencour [<i>pain court</i> (short
bread), the common nickname of St. Louis] by
surprise, from the easy admission of the Indians
of that place, will be less difficult than
holding it afterwards.... The Sioux shall go
with all dispatch as low down as the Natchez,
and as many intermediate attacks as possible
shall be made" (<i>Ibid.</i> pp. 546, 547).</p>
<p class="pfc4">May 29, he again writes that seven hundred
and fifty men, including traders, servants, and
Indians, proceeded down the Mississippi on the
second day of May, with the Indians engaged at
the westward, for an attack on the Spanish and
Illinois country. He mentions Prairie du Chien
as the place of assembling. "Capt. Hesse will
remain at Pencour; Wabasha will attack Misère
[wretchedness, the popular nickname for Ste.
Geneviève] and the rebels at Kacasia [Kaskaskia].
Two vessels leave this place on the 2d of
June to attend Machigwawish, who returns by
the Illinois River with prisoners. All the traders
who will secure the posts on the Spanish
side of the Mississippi during the next winter
have my promise for the exclusive trade of the
Missouri during that time, and that their canoes
will be forwarded" (<i>Ibid.</i> 548, 549).</p>

Brymner, <i>Report</i>, 1882, p. 34. He writes to
Sinclair, March 12: "Your movements down the
[Mississippi] shall be seconded from this place
by my sending a part of the garrison with some
small ordnance. Their route shall be to the Ohio,
which they shall cross, and attack some of the
forts which surround the Indian hunting-ground
of Kentucky. I have had the Wabash Indians
here by invitation; they have promised to keep
Clark at the Falls" (<i>Michigan Pioneer Coll.</i>, p.
580). His allusions are to Capt. Byrd's expedition.
May 18, he again writes to Sinclair:
"Capt. Byrd left this place (Detroit) with a detachment
of about 150 whites and 1000 Indians.
He must be by this time nigh the Ohio" (<i>Ibid.</i>
P. 582).</p>

Among his prisoners were Col. Dickson, in
command of the British settlements on the Mississippi;
556 regulars, and many sailors.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1554_1554" id="Footnote_1554_1554"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1554_1554"><span class="label">[1554]</span></a></span>
Gayarré, <i>Louisiana, Span. Dom.</i>, pp. 121-147.
Galvez discovered, by intercepted letters from
Natchez, the scheme of the English to attack
the Spanish settlements as early as it was known
by Sinclair (p. 122), and he was earnest to strike
the first blow. Clark also heard of it very early.
Sinclair, writing to Haldimand, says: "No doubt
can remain, from the concurrent testimony of
the prisoners, that the enemy received intelligence
of the meditated attack on the Illinois
about the time I received a copy of my Lord
George Germain's circular letter" (<i>Mich. Pion.
Coll.</i>, ix. 559). In the same letter he gives some
details of the raids on St. Louis and Cahokia,
which do not appear elsewhere: "Twenty of the
volunteer Canadians from this place and a very
few of the traders and servants made their attack
on Pencour and the Cahokias. The Winnipigoes
and Sioux would have stormed the
Spanish lines, if the Sacs and Outagamies, under
their treacherous leader Mons. Calvé, had not
fallen back so early. A Mons. Ducharme and
others who traded in the country of the Sacs
kept pace with Mons. Calvé in his perfidy. The
attack, unsuccessful as it was, from misconduct,
and unsupported, I believe, by any other against
New Orleans, with the advances made by the
enemy on the Mississippi, will still have its good
consequences. The Winnepigoes had a chief
and three men killed and four wounded. The
traders who would not assist in extending their
commerce cannot complain to its being confined
to necessary bounds." Writing later to De
Peyster (<i>Ibid.</i> 586), he says: "The attack upon
the Illinois miscarried from the treachery of
Calvé and Ducharme, traders, and from the information
received by the enemy so early as
March last." For statements that the expedition
against St. Louis was organized and led by Jean
Marie Ducharme, see <i>Wis. Hist. Coll.</i>, iii. 232; vii.
176. It is evident that the objective point of the
attack, in Sinclair's mind, was the Illinois country,
rather than the Spanish settlements. Haldimand,
writing to De Peyster, Feb. 12, 1779, said:
"Sinclair should strike at the Illinois" (Brymner,
1882, p. 33). Sinclair, writing to Brehm,
Feb. 17, 1780, concerning the attack on St. Louis,
said: "Afterwards they can act against the rebels
on this side [of the Mississippi], which I have
pointed out to them" (<i>Mich. Pion. Coll.</i>, ix. 543).</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1555_1555" id="Footnote_1555_1555"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1555_1555"><span class="label">[1555]</span></a></span>
Sinclair seems not to have heard of the
capture of Natchez by the Spaniards, which
occurred Sept. 21, 1779, until July 30, 1780, when
he wrote to De Peyster: "The report of the
Natchez seems too well founded" (<i>Ibid.</i> 587).</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1556_1556" id="Footnote_1556_1556"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1556_1556"><span class="label">[1556]</span></a></span>

Stoddard and Martin state that Clark was
present; Nicollet denies the statement, on the
ground that Clark was then at Kaskaskia, and
"that gallant officer could not have had time
to aid in that affair." Hall and Billon make
no mention of Clark; and Primm and Peck (in
Perkins) say that Clark tendered aid to Leyba
in 1779, but not in 1780. It was a part of
Clark's policy to be always on friendly terms
with the Spanish commandant at St. Louis
(<i>Campaign</i>, p. 35), and to give aid whenever he
needed it. In so doing, as they were fighting
a common enemy, he served his own interests.
Mr. O. W. Collet, in <i>Mag. of Western Hist.</i>, i.
271, has discussed the friendly relations between
Clark and Leyba before the attack on
St. Louis, but is unmindful of the significance
given to it in the text. See also Scharff's <i>Hist.
of St. Louis</i>, p. 217.</p>

Sinclair reported to Haldimand, July 8th,
"Two hundred Illinois cavalry arrived at Chicago
five days after the vessels left" (<i>Mich.
Pion. Coll.</i>, ix. 558).</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1560_1560" id="Footnote_1560_1560"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1560_1560"><span class="label">[1560]</span></a></span>
Dr. Lyman C. Draper (<i>Wisconsin Hist. Coll.</i>,
ix. 291) says: "There was a party of Spanish
allies sent out with Montgomery's expedition
from Cahokia in the latter part of May, 1780,
in the direction of Rock River." See also his
note (<i>Ibid.</i> vii. 176). He thinks that the Spaniards
and some of the Americans probably returned
by way of Prairie du Chien, and that
they were the party mentioned by Long in his
<i>Voyages</i>, 1791.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_1561_1561" id="Footnote_1561_1561"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1561_1561"><span class="label">[1561]</span></a></span>
<i>Michigan Pioneer Col.</i>, ix. 541. Capt. Byrd,
writing to De Peyster, May 21, 1780, reports
that a Delaware Indian has come in from the
Falls with this information: "Col. Clark says
he will wait for us, instead of going to the Mississippi;
his numbers do not exceed 200; his
provisions and ammunition short" (<i>Ibid.</i> 584).
Clark was on his way to St. Louis before this
date, and was back to Kentucky in season to
block Byrd's plans.</p>

It is noticeable that in these decisive campaigns
efficient aid was furnished in the West by
Spain, and in the East by France; and that both
these powers, in the negotiations for a treaty of
peace with Great Britain, threw their influence
against the interests of the United States.</p>

Mr. Jay (Sparks's <i>Dipl. Corres.</i>, viii. 76-78)
gives the main facts concerning the Spanish
expedition to St. Joseph, which he translated
from the <i>Madrid Gazette</i> of March 12, 1782. Mr.
E. G. Mason (<i>Mag. of Amer. Hist.</i>, xv. 457) has
treated the subject more fully in a paper entitled
"March of the Spaniards across Illinois in
1781." See also Reynolds's <i>Illinois</i>, ed. 1887, p.
126; Dillon's <i>Indiana</i>, ed. 1843, p. 190; Perkins's
<i>Annals</i>, ed. 1851, p. 251.</p>
<p class="pfc4">Dr. Franklin, writing from Passy, April 12,
1782, to Secretary Livingston, said: "I see by
the newspapers that the Spaniards, having taken
a little post called St. Joseph, pretend to have
made a conquest of the Illinois country. In
what light does this proceeding appear to Congress?
While they decline our offered friendship,
are they to be suffered to encroach on
our bounds, and shut us up within the Appalachian
Mountains? I begin to fear they have
some such project" (<i>Works</i>, Sparks, ix. 206).</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
